Thus, I recommend you check out **Chapter 9** of the network science book. In particular, we'll delve into [Section 9.4](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/9#modularity) in the exercises below. We will also talk a little bit about degree correlations - you can read about those in [Chapter 7](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/7)\\.\n",

    ">     - *Note 3*: Further analysis is done with the largest component\n",
    ">2. As you build the graph, store the attributes of the nodes (their `coast`). On top of that, let's also store the `length of the content` as one of the attributes of the node (i.e. count the number of *words* you have in each rapper's page). By storing this information as nodal features, we keep all the relevant data in one place. The safe way to count words without counting symbols is to use `regex`, but simpler methods are OK."

    ">   * Secondly, and more interestingly, it could be that famous rappers have longer texts. And that means more in-links. \n",

You may choose the method of your liking to study this question (e.g. look at it visually, test the correlation using spearman or pearson, fit a curve to the data, you decide). Once you've tested, let me know. Are both questions true? If yes, which phenomenon is stronger? Explain your results in your own words."

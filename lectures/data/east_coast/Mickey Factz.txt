Mickey Factz recently finished touring with [[Big Sean]] and is working on his album ''The Achievement'', which is set to be released in Winter 2013/2014<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mickeyfactz.com/ |title=Home |website=mickeyfactz.com}}</ref>
Mickey Factz became the new member of All City Chess Club when [[Lupe Fiasco]] said at a radio station "Mickey Factz is part of All City Chess Club."
While in the studio recording for his debut album, Mickey tweeted that he and Lupe Fiasco are collaborating on a track. Also pictures of the two together have surfaced on the internet recently. "I’m Better Than You'' (2010) was Mickey’s way of expressing his sense of confidence and recognition of the competitiveness of music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mickeyfactz-theartisticcollection.com/?p=84 |title=I'm Better Than You (2010) &#124; |accessdate=2013-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131010060014/http://mickeyfactz-theartisticcollection.com/?p=84 |archivedate=2013-10-10 }}</ref> "Love.Lust.Lost" (2011) was an album based on one of Factz’ past relationship and was his attempt to get the girl he loved back. Although in the end, she slipped away, this album represents Mickey Factz’ growth not only as an artist but also as a person. Deeply personal and honest, this was enjoyed by a wide variety of people who could relate to his deep and heartfelt lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mickeyfactz-theartisticcollection.com/?p=87 |title=Love.

===Mickey Mause===
In 2012, Factz tried to release Mickey MauSe under his label, but they considered it to be too artistic and did not back it up. Factz went on to release this experimental project himself and in the album, Mickey Mause became his pseudo character, thrown into the 1980s as a graffiti writer who was later kicked out by his parents for being a troubled youth. This project represented what it truly meant to be an artist and much research was done in order to learn about Mickey Mouse and that era of time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mickeyfactz-theartisticcollection.com/?p=92 |title=Mickey Mause (2012) &#124; |accessdate=2013-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131010060109/http://mickeyfactz-theartisticcollection.com/?p=92 |archivedate=2013-10-10 }}</ref> Lyrically, this mixtape is known for being one of Factz’ best and gained him the opportunity to become closer to Lupe Fiasco.

In a 2015 interview with hip hop blog [http://themusicstash.com/ The Music Stash], Factz said a sequel to Mickey Mause called Mau2e was scheduled for Christmas.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://themusicstash.com/2015/03/03/mickey-factz-talks-malcom-x-music-video-new-album-and-mickey-mause-2/ | title=安全通过 - 请点击前往 }}</ref>

'''Robert Mandell''', professionally known as '''G Koop''', is an American [[Grammy award|Grammy]]-nominated record producer, songwriter and musician.

==Early life==
G Koop is originally from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. His father had a large collection of albums, and his mother contends that G Koop's first word was "doobie," interpreted as a request for [[The Doobie Brothers]] to be played. His first job was at a record store. As a young child, he learned to play a number of instruments, including guitar, bass, piano, and drums.<ref name="DJBooth">{{cite web|title=Meet G Koop, Your Favorite Producer's Secret Sample Clearance Weapon|url=http://djbooth.net/news/entry/2017-01-23-g-koop-interview|website=DJBooth|publisher=DJBooth|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref>

G Koop graduated from [[Berklee College of Music]]. While there, he studied music theory and performance. G Koop plays some of these instruments in his own studio while making his samples. Also while at Berklee, G Koop met [[Graham Richards]] and Anthony Caruso. The three have had an ongoing collaboration dubbed "G Koop and O-Man" since then.<ref name="The Back Packerz">{{cite web|title=G KOOP, L'ARME SECRÈTE DES LABELS POUR CONTOURNER LE SAMPLE CLEARING|url=http://thebackpackerz.com/g-koop-secret-labels-contourner-sample-clearing/|website=The Back Packerz|date=25 January 2017 |publisher=The Back Packerz|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
G Koop moved to [[California]] in 2002 and formed a jazz band, "The People's Quintet," with drummer [[Donald Bailey (musician)|Donald "Duck" Bailey]]. Unable to find work for the group, G Koop instead began working with music production software, such as [[Pro Tools]] and Reason.<ref name="DJBooth" />

He has been called a specialist in "[[Interpolation (popular music)|replaying samples]]", in which an original [[Sampling (music)|sample]] is reinterpreted and recreated in the studio. The resulting track is a new interpretation that is no longer under the original's copyright, but it still retains the original's character. Producers can use the new work in their own songs without having to pay the fees required to sample the original track.<ref name="hnhh">{{cite web|title="Bad And Boujee" Co-Producer G-Koop Lets Us In On His Secret Method|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/bad-and-boujee-co-producer-g-koop-lets-us-in-on-his-secret-method-news.27883.html|website=hnhh|publisher=hnhh|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref><ref name="Sample Replay Society">{{cite web|title=Sample Replay Society - About G Koop|url=http://www.samplereplaysociety.com/?page_id=127|website=Sample Replay Society|publisher=Sample Replay Society|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref>

G Koop first produced for the Bay Area hip-hop group Foreign Legion. The group's [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]], Prozack Turner, introduced him to producer [[Jake One]], who in turn employed G Koop as a piano teacher. The two worked together on Jake's 2008 album, ''[[White Van Music]]'', with G Koop performing instruments. He also worked on Jake's 2009 collaboration with [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]], ''[[The Stimulus Package]]''. The two also partnered together on [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]'s "[[Furthest Thing]]" for his 2013 ''Nothing was the Same'' album. Jake One found the original sample for "Furthest Thing" from a 1990s live [[gospel music|gospel]] album that Gene Brown, a record collector, recommended to him. However, the rights owners to the song requested high fees. Instead, Jake One asked G Koop to make an interpolation of the sample to avoid publishing issues. G Koop played all the instruments—guitar, piano, organ, drums, and bass—in his studio. The album's main producer, [[Noah "40" Shebib]], recorded the vocals for the track with a choir in [[Toronto]].<ref name="DJBooth" /><ref name="npr">{{cite web|last1=Matson|first1=Andrew|title=This Beat's For You: The Making Of Drake's 'Furthest Thing'|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/10/01/228235377/the-making-of-drakes-furthest-thing|website=npr|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref>

G Koop's first major placement as producer was [[Nelly]]'s "Self Esteem" featuring [[Chuck D]], which was on Nelly's 2008 gold album ''[[Brass Knuckles (album)|Brass Knuckles]]''. He has worked with a number of artists, including [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]], [[MF Doom|DOOM]], Funkadelic, The Game, [[G Unit]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Pusha T]], [[Rhymesayers]], and [[Rihanna]], among others. G Koop also wrote, produced, and played a number of songs with [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] on Funkadelic's 2014 [[First Ya Gotta Shake the Gate]]. The album, the first for the band in 33 years, provided 33 tracks with a number of artists, including [[Sly Stone]], [[Soul Clap]], and [[Bootsy Collins]]. The second single on the album, "Ain’t that Funkin’ Kinda Hard on You," was written and produced by G Koop and George Clinton. Hip Hop producer Ill Tal, in his review, called it "one of the best songs on the album and the name of George’s new auto-biography. The song is smooth, mellow, and funky with George doing most of the vocal leads." Nick DeRiso, in his review of the album for Something Else Reviews, called "Ain’t that Funkin’ Kinda Hard on You" the "perfect reintroduction of George Clinton … since it begins with a darkly ingratiating embrace rather that the expected turn-this-mother-out groove."  DeRiso goes on to call the track the "standout moment from Funkadelic’s sprawling new comeback effort." Other G Koop songs were singled out in reviews as well. Ill Tal wrote of "You Can’t Unring the Bell," that it is "probably my favorite hip-hop influenced song on the album." Ill Tal went on to refer to G Koop (although not by name): "Whoever made the beat did a great job sampling a break beat for the drums and what sounds like an old horn riff from George’s vaults." G Koop's bass playing was also recognized in E.E. Bradman's review for ''[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]]'', who commended G Koop's bass playing on a number of tracks.<ref name="HipHopDX">{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Soren|title=Brother Ali Discusses Creative Direction Of New Album|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.37718/title.brother-ali-discusses-creative-direction-of-new-album#|website=HipHopDX|publisher=HipHopDX|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref><ref name="http://illtal.com">{{cite web|last1=Tal|first1=Ill|title=Review: Funkadelic - First Ya Gotta Shake the Gate|url=http://illtal.com/review-funkadelic-first-ya-gotta-shake-the-gate/|website=illtal.com|publisher=illtal.com|accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref><ref name="SomethingElse!

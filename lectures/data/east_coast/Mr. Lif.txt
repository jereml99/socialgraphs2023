'''Jeffrey Michael Haynes''' (born December 28, 1977), better known by his stage name '''Mr. Lif''', is an American rapper from [[Boston]], Massachusetts. While being praised because of his political lyrics, he has released two studio albums on [[Definitive Jux]] and one on Bloodbot Tactical Enterprises. Mr. Lif is also a member of the hip hop group [[The Perceptionists]] with long-time friends and collaborators [[Akrobatik]] and [[DJ Fakts One]].

== Early life ==
Haynes grew up in the neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref name="TC" /> After attending the [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] private school [[Noble and Greenough School]], he went on to attend [[Colgate University]] for two years, and he eventually dropped out. He became a performer in 1994. Mr. Lif's family ancestry is [[Barbadians|Bajan]].

Haynes adopted the stage name "Mr. Lif" after ingesting [[psilocybin mushroom]]s at an outdoor [[Phish]] concert during his freshman year at [[Colgate University]] in 1994. He imagined a fictional character called The Liftedly Man while under the influence, which gave way to "Mr. Lif".<ref name="TC" /> He later said in an interview for the ''[[Times Colonist]]'': "I don't know any Phish songs. I went to the show, and I still don't know anything about them now."<ref name="TC">{{cite news|title=A Phish tale the source of Boston rapper's stage name|newspaper=[[Times Colonist]]|location=Victoria, British Columbia|year=2006}}</ref>

== Career ==
Influenced by legendary MC's like [[Chuck D]], [[KRS-One]], and [[Rakim]], Mr. Lif began releasing singles in the late '90s, when party rap and gangsta rap were the dominant styles for hip hop music, but Mr. Lif's lyrical agenda was a political and socially conscious one. Mr. Lif released his first single, ''Elektro'', in 1998, attracting the attention of labels Grand Royal and [[Definitive Jux]]. Working closely with producer and Definitive Jux label head [[El-P]], Lif released a series of critically acclaimed singles and EPs, starting with ''Enters the Colossus'' in 2000. In 2000 and 2001, he won the [[Boston Music Awards|Boston Music Award]] for Outstanding [[Rapping|Rap]]/[[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]] Act.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.hiphop-elements.com/article/read/4/5310/1/ | title=Mr. Lif Wins Big at the 2001 Boston Music Awards | date=April 24, 2001 | publisher=Hip-Hop Elements }}</ref> Touring kept him busy for the next year, but he still found time to release the ''Cro-Magnon'' single and a live CD. His track "Pull Out Your Cut" was featured in the soundtrack to the ESPN Video Game ESPN NFL 2K5.

In 2002, Mr. Lif released a pair of concept releases. ''The Emergency Rations'' EP bookended collaborations with [[Edan (musician)|Edan]] and [[Akrobatik]] in an MC abduction scenario, while the ''I Phantom'' full-length formed a saga that led him from birth to apocalypse. He revisited his [[Akrobatik]] collaboration in 2005, when the pair joined producer [[DJ Fakts One]] to form [[The Perceptionists]], who released ''Black Dialogue'', also on [[Definitive Jux]]. One year later, he returned with ''Mo' Mega'', his follow-up to ''I Phantom'', featuring eight productions from [[El-P]] and features from [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]], [[Aesop Rock]], and [[Blueprint (rapper)|Blueprint]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/artists/mr-lif | title=Mr Lif | year=2007 | publisher=NME }}</ref> Mr. Lif has also collaborated with Otis Grove, [[Thievery Corporation]] and [[Anomie Belle]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Tom | last=Blodgett | url=https://www.seattlesubsonic.com/2009/09/05/anomie-belle-w-mr-lif-bumbershoot/ | title=Anomie Belle w/ Mr. Lif @ Bumbershoot | date=September 5, 2009 | publisher=Seattle Subsonic | access-date=January 1, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629112429/http://www.seattlesubsonic.com/2009/09/05/anomie-belle-w-mr-lif-bumbershoot/ | archive-date=June 29, 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

''I Heard It Today'' was released on Bloodbot Tactical Enterprises in 2009. Mr Lif embraced ''I Heard It Today'' using the album as a tool to address various political issues affecting people all over the world. ''I Heard It Today'' is the third full-length studio album by Mr. Lif. The album was released on April 21, 2009, on Mr. Lif's own label Bloodbot Tactical Enterprises. Mr. Lif has stated that the album is "dedicated to capturing the pulse of this tumultuous era we're living through."

In June 2014, Mr. Lif announced on his Facebook that he is working on an album with The Polish Ambassador that will be released in the fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/mrlif/posts/10152881276418154 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/13797928153/10152881276418154 |archive-date=February 26, 2022 |url-access=limited|title=Mr. Lif|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=December 7, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In September 2014, the pair embarked on a national 5-week [[Permaculture]] Action tour with fellow musicians [[Ayla Nereo]] and Liminus. The musicians performed 4–5 days a week and then participated in weekly "Permaculture Action Days" where they held permaculture themed events and activities within the communities they were visiting.

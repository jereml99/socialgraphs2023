'''Alvin Lamar Worthy''' (born July 27, 1982), known professionally as '''Westside Gunn''', is an American [[rapping|rapper]]. He is a co-founder of independent hip-hop label [[Griselda Records]]. He is the brother of rapper [[Conway the Machine]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.passionweiss.com/2016/02/15/i-love-fly-street-shit-an-interview-with-westside-gunn/|title=I Love Fly Street Shit: An Interview With Westside Gunn|date=March 11, 2016|publisher=Passionweiss|access-date=March 11, 2016}}</ref> and cousin of rapper [[Benny the Butcher]], both of whom he frequently collaborates with. Westside Gunn has released four studio albums in addition to an extensive catalog of mixtapes. Gunn was affiliated with [[Shady Records]] from 2017 to 2020, but has since returned to independent status.

==Career==
Westside Gunn released his first mixtape in 2005, however his career was derailed by run-ins with the law.  Gunn did not release any music in the years 2006-2011.<ref name="Pryor">{{Cite web |last=Pryor |first=Lex |date=2020-10-02 |title=The Flygod Takes Flight |url=https://www.theringer.com/2020/10/2/21496839/westside-gunn-griselda-who-made-the-sunshine-interview |access-date=2022-04-27 |website=The Ringer |language=en}}</ref>

In 2012, Westside Gunn co-founded the Griselda Records label with his paternal half-brother [[Conway the Machine]] and [[Mach-Hommy]].<ref name="Shady-Griselda-deal" /> Gunn was inspired to revitalize his career by the shooting of his brother Conway that same year, which left him with permanent disabilities, as well as by the 2006 murder of his cousin Machine Gun Black. Gunn's first project for Griselda was the mixtape ''Hitler Wears Hermes.'' While the name attracted controversy for its reference to [[Adolf Hitler]], Gunn explained that the name is a play on ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]''.<ref name="Pryor"/>

Over the next few years, Gunn released a steady stream of mixtapes and EPs, including multiple sequels to ''Hitler Wears Hermes,'' on the Griselda label. Gunn's official studio album debut was ''Flygod,'' released on March 11, 2016.

On March 3, 2017, Griselda Records signed a deal with [[Eminem]]'s [[Shady Records]], making Westside Gunn and Conway the first rappers from Buffalo to sign with a major label.<ref name="Shady-Griselda-deal">{{Cite web|url=http://shadyrecords.com/2017/03/03/shady-x-griselda-ink-deal-for-westside-gunn-and-conway/|title=Shady X Griselda Ink Deal for WestsideGunn and Conway|website=Shady Records|access-date=2017-03-03}}</ref> After signing with Shady, Gunn played at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Firefly Music Festival|Firefly]] and [[Governors Ball Music Festival|Governors Ball]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/garysuarez/2018/06/22/westside-gunn-griselda/|title=At The Nexus Of Rap And Wrestling, Westside Gunn Reigns Supreme|last=Suarez|first=Gary|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-06-01}}</ref> On October 2, 2020, Westside Gunn released his [[Aftermath Entertainment|Shady Records]] debut, ''[[Who Made the Sunshine]]'', his only solo project with [[Shady Records]].

In 2021, he released two songs titled "TV Boy" and "Julia Lang".

Combs became an [[intern]] at New York's [[Uptown Records]] in 1990.{{sfn|Traugh|2010|p=23}}<ref name="YNUptown"/> While working as a talent director at Uptown, he helped develop [[Jodeci]] and [[Mary J.

Originally titled ''Hell up in Harlem'', the album underwent several changes after [[Murder of Christopher Wallace|the Notorious B.I.G. was killed]] on March 9, 1997.<ref name="xxlmag 2007"/> Several of the label's artists made guest appearances on the album.

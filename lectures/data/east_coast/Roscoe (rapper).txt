He made his first appearance on his brother's album [[Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha]], featuring on the vocals ''"I Call Shots"'' and ''"Girls All Pause"'' along with [[Nate Dogg]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Roscoe/+wiki|title = Roscoe age, hometown, biography}}</ref> [[Daz Dillinger]] was impressed with Roscoe and helped to produce his debut mixtape, ''"When The Pain Inflict"'', released in 2001. Thanks to the positive reception of his mixtape, Roscoe signed with [[Priority Records]] and immediately got to work on his debut album, [[Young Roscoe Philaphornia]], released in 2003. The album peaked at #22 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart.

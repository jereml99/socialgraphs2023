Although active in the Baltimore hip-hop scene since 2011, he rose to prominence with "Bank Rolls (Remix)," a 90-second promotional single for his April 2015 release “Live Hazey,” released on [[YouTube]] on April 19, 2015, in remembrance of his mother. In 2020, he co-wrote the single "[[Mr. Right Now]]" by [[21 Savage]] and [[Metro Boomin]] (featuring [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]).

==Early and personal life==
Tate Kobang grew up in Northeast Baltimore, Maryland, before moving to [[York, Pennsylvania]], as a teenager, where he attended [[Central York High School]] before dropping out to pursue [[rap]]. In 2013, his mother and father died suddenly within months of each other, making him responsible for his 8 younger siblings at age 21, prompting him to continue music at a more serious level to provide for his family.<ref name="Baltimore Sun">{{cite news|last1=Case|first1=Wesley|title=With 'Bank Rolls,' Baltimore rapper Tate Kobang arrives|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/music/midnight-sun-blog/bal-tate-kobang-baltimore-rapper-bank-rolls-story.html|accessdate=10 May 2016|work=Baltimore Sun|date= Jan 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kyles|first1=Yohance|title=#DMVOnTheMove: Tate Kobang Wants The World To Know He Won't Be Placed In Any Musical Box|url=http://allhiphop.com/2016/05/12/exclusive-dmv-on-the-move-tate-kobang-300-entertainment-live-hazey/|accessdate=18 May 2016|work=Exclusive Hip Hop News, Interviews, Rumors, Rap & Music Videos {{!}} Allhiphop|date=12 May 2016}}</ref>

==Influences==
Although he originally wanted to be a [[video game programmer]], Kobang’s interest in music stemmed at an early age—he sang in his [[church choir]] at age 5, and began writing music around age 11. He also learned to read music and play the [[saxophone]] and [[piano]] in [[middle school]], and took [[music production]] classes in high school. Kobang’s uncle, Baltimore rapper Killa Q, introduced him to rap, and even had Kobang write for him. Kobang also credits artists [[Mr. Cheeks]], [[Method Man]], and [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]] as influences.<ref name="Vice">{{cite news|last1=Burney|first1=Lawrence|title=Bet They Know Me: Tate Kobang Is Ready to Be Baltimore's First Rapper to Blow {{!}} NOISEY|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/tate-kobang-bank-rolls-baltimore-first-rapper-to-blow-interview|accessdate=10 May 2016|work=NOISEY|publisher=Vice Media}}</ref>

==Career==

===Success of Bank Rolls (Remix)===

In honor of his late mother’s birthday, a tribute that’s been done since 2013, Kobang released Bank Rolls (Remix) on April 19, 2015, as a promotional hit for his newest mixtape. Bank Rolls (Remix) was a featured song in Watch Dogs 2. The song uses Baltimore rapper Tim Trees' 2000 song “Bank Roll” and features a verse that remembers Baltimore DJ [[K-Swift]], who died in 2008. That day is also the day of [[Death of Freddie Gray|Freddie Gray]]'s death after being in a coma from injury complications allegedly caused by the [[Baltimore Police Department]]. With heavy media attention and national focus on Baltimore at this time, Kobang released the song to bring a sense of happiness and pride to the city. Following the viral success of the 90-second video, Kobang went into the studio with the producer of the original track, [[Rod Lee]], to extend the track into a full song.<ref name="Vice" /><ref name="BCP">{{cite web|last1=Watkins|first1=D.|title=D.

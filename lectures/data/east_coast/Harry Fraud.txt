== Career ==
=== Early life and career ===
Harry Fraud comes from a musical family background, where his parents performed in a band together. His father is a guitar player, while his mother is a singer.<ref name="NahRight" /><ref name="Life+Times">{{cite news |url=http://lifeandtimes.com/check-the-credits-harry-fraud-speaks-on-his-sound-producing-for-french-montana-new-label |title=Harry Fraud Speaks On His Sound, Producing For French Montana & New Label |publisher=[[Life+Times]] |date=August 25, 2014 |access-date=August 18, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422024344/http://lifeandtimes.com/check-the-credits-harry-fraud-speaks-on-his-sound-producing-for-french-montana-new-label |archive-date=April 22, 2016 }}</ref> His father was in the concert business, which gave Fraud access to instruments and recording equipment at an early age.<ref name="Life+Times" /> He received his first turntables on Christmas, and the next year had gotten what he describes as a "piece of shit sampler". It's after acquiring his first [[Music Production Center|MPC]] that he began seriously working on beat production.<ref name="Life+Times" />

Upon graduating high school, Fraud began interning at a recording studio, which became his first exposure to [[Pro Tools]].<ref name="NahRight">{{cite magazine|url=http://nahright.com/news/in-the-lab-with-harry-fraud/ |title=In The Lab with Harry Fraud |magazine=[[Complex (magazine)|NahRight]] |date=February 27, 2014 |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref>  He was also influenced by Fafu of BlesteNation, who was a producer at the same building.<ref name="NahRight" /> After getting into college, he acquired Pro Tools for himself, quickly immersing himself in front of the computer and becoming his main distraction, "I didn't do any [school] work. I wouldn't even go to class. It was terrible," claimed Fraud in an interview with Nah Right.<ref name="NahRight" /> During his time in college, he met his friend Red Walrus – now the musical director of the band which Fraud works with – where the two bonded over digging through crates and buying [[vinyl records]] from places such as [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]] and the [[Salvation Army]].<ref name="NahRight" /> His musical composition has been used by the [[International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|International Emmy Awards]], which Fraud credits his father for getting through to its [[television producer|producers]].<ref name="HipHopDX">{{cite magazine| last=Price |first=Sean |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1979/title.sean-price-interviews-harry-fraud-they-discuss-hamburgers-surfing-producer-tags |title=Sean Price Interviews Harry Fraud: They Discuss Hamburgers, Surfing & Producer Tags |magazine=[[HipHopDX]] |date=November 2, 2012 |access-date=August 25, 2013}}</ref> Fraud's composition work would go on to be praised by [[Simon Cowell]], who, at the [[38th International Emmy Awards|2010 Emmy Awards]] ceremony took notice of Fraud's walk up music, even requesting it be replayed briefly during his speech.<ref name="HipHopDX" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4vWVmQvgnk |title=Simon Cowell (American Idol) talks about Harry Fraud |publisher=YouTube |date=December 3, 2010 |access-date=August 25, 2013}}</ref>

=== French Montana and the Coke Boys ===
Harry Fraud rose to prominence through his collaboration with French Montana on the song "New York Minute", featuring [[Jadakiss]], off of French's fifth mixtape ''Mac Wit Da Cheese'' released on April 19, 2009. In a 2013 interview with [[Rolling Stone]] magazine, Harry Fraud revealed first meeting close friend and artist French Montana during a recording session at a studio in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-old-fashioned-values-of-producer-harry-fraud-20131218|title=The Old-Fashioned Values of Producer Harry Fraud|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 18, 2013|access-date=August 12, 2015}}</ref> Fraud recalls recording a song for someone which French happened to have a guest feature on. In an unusual turn of events, the building was raided by police after a tip-off that there were counterfeit Gucci and Louis Vuitton purses being manufactured at the same building.<ref name="RollingStone" /> Having lost his studio spot, Fraud went on to form his own studio in Brooklyn, where the two "met and formed a bond".<ref name="RollingStone" />

Following the release of "New York Minute", the two artists would go on to record "We Playin In The Wind" off of French Montana's sixth mixtape ''The Laundry Man 2'', released on June 29, 2009. An extended version of the song would be included on French's seventh mixtape ''Cocaine Konvicts'' released on September 25. Since then, Harry Fraud's production has been a staple among French's music, becoming Fraud's gateway to working with other high-profile artists since then. With the success of "New York Minute", rapper [[Ma$e]] had approached French Montana to hop on the remix,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2011/08/french-montana-talks-rick-ross-and-possibly-signing-to-mmg/ |title=French Montana Talks Rick Ross and Possibly Signing to MMG |magazine=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] |date=August 30, 2011 |access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref> released on French's eighth mixtape ''Coke Wave 2'' in November that year. Fraud would go on to produce several tracks off of French's ninth mixtape ''Mac & Cheese 2'' released on May 6, 2010, and French's tenth mixtape ''[[Coke Boys (2010)|Coke Boys]]'' released on September 15, collaborating with Coke Boys rappers Chinx Drugz, Cheeze, Flip and Brock.

Harry Fraud executive produced the overall mixtape, and his subsequent twelfth mixtape ''Coke Boys 2'' released on August 19 of that same year.<ref name="Life+Times" /> Through French, Fraud was introduced to his fellow Coke Boy rapper Chinx Drugz. The two would go on to work on their collaborative mixtape ''Flight 2011'' which was released on March 11, 2011, and several tracks off of his subsequent ''Cocaine Riot'' mixtape released on April 19 that year. Fraud's production would also be included in French's collaborative mixtape with [[Juicy J]] and [[Project Pat]] ''[[Cocaine Mafia]]'' released on December 20, 2011. By 2012, with the popularity of "Shot Caller", a remix was released featuring rappers [[Rick Ross]] and [[Sean Combs|Diddy]].

== Production style ==
Harry Fraud's production has been described as "New York tinged, sample heavy, foggy music."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/2013/05/istandard-producers-weigh-in-on-xxls-2013-freshman-producers-list/7/|title=IStandard Producers Weigh in on XXL's 2013 Freshman Producers List – XXL}}</ref> Fraud's production leans heavily on samples, and he's become known for turning obscure tracks into hard-knocking beats.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/2013/03/harry-fraud-talks-sampling-adrift-mixtape-download/ Harry Fraud Talks Sampling, 'Adrift' Mixtape [Download&#93; - XXL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In an interview with HipHopDX Fraud described his style saying, "What's most important to me with production is that I'm just always trying to do something unique. If I approach a production—whether it be sample-based or starting with something that originates in my head—I always try to do it in a way that is not typical at all. So if it's something that I feel where I might be going down a path that sounds too much like what's going on now, I'll make sure to try and take a left turn and do something that's my own. I try not to have a style, so to speak."<ref name="HipHopDX Article with Smoke DZA">{{cite magazine|last=Sanchez |first=Jolie |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1928/title.smoke-dza-harry-fraud-break-down-rugby-thompson-lo-lifes-and-hanging-out-with-tina-turner |title=Smoke Dza & Harry Fraud Break Down "Rugby Thompson," Lo-Lifes And Hanging Out With Tina Turner &#124; Rappers Talk Hip Hop Beef & Old School Hip Hop |magazine=[[HipHopDX]] |date=July 10, 2012 |access-date=August 25, 2013}}</ref> He went on to describe the use of drums on his beats stating, "I'm more about trying to have a strong drum presence—whether the drum is a big, huge snare or a little, tiny rimshot—I wanna make sure that the presence of the drums is felt no matter what."<ref name="HipHopDX Article with Smoke DZA" /> Fraud's signature tag at the beginning of his productions consists of singer Fanesha Fabre saying "La musica de Harry Fraud".<ref name=HipHopDX />

== Surf School Recordings ==
In 2012, Harry Fraud founded his own record label "Surf School Recordings", the name a tribute to [[Max B]] and Fraud's own passion for [[surfing]].<ref name="Life+Times" /> His father, who was a frequent traveler, was a surfer who would often take Fraud on trips with him where he discovered his passion for surfing.<ref name="HipHopDX" /> In 2013, Fraud signed a deal making it an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] under [[Priority Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2501565/priority-records-relaunches-with-just-blaze-and-harry-fraud/ |title=Priority Records Relaunches With Just Blaze And Harry Fraud |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=July 23, 2013 |access-date=February 1, 2016}}</ref> In a 2014 interview with [[Life+Times]] he noted,
<blockquote>The SRFSCHL label comes from the concept of what [[Max B]] brought to the light with "the wave" and his philosophy and what me and [[French Montana|French]] have been carrying on. It also kind of came out of me being into surfing. I feel like people get a lot of influence off of the stuff we do. We're teaching people how to ride the wave anyway, just off of them listening to our music. I'm a deeply philosophical person, so SRFSCHL has since taken on many different meanings.<ref name="Life+Times" /></blockquote>

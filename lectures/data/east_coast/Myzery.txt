'''Nene Encarnacion''', also known as '''Myzery''', is a Puerto Rican rapper based out of the Bronx in New York City. He was the first solo act signed with [[Psychopathic Records]], and released his debut EP titled ''Para La Isla'' on the label in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |title=Discogs Entry for EP|url=http://www.discogs.com/Myzery-Para-La-Isla/release/1823966 |year=2009 |publisher=Discogs |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref> Following his departure from Psychopathic Records, Myzery continued to release albums independently.<ref name="FaygoLuvers">{{cite web |title=Faygo Luvers Interview |url=http://www.faygoluvers.net/v5/2012/04/myzery-41712/ |date=April 17, 2012 |publisher=Faygo Luvers |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}</ref> He later returned to Psychopathic Records to release 2018's ''The Demon Angel''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Site Upcoming Purchase Page for DemonAngel|url=http://www.myzery2012.com/merchandise#ecwid:category=3406137&mode=product&product=14181691 |date=May 15, 2012 |publisher=PoorManzEnt |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref>

== Career ==
Born in the [[Bronx]], Myzery started rapping while growing up through hard times. He expressed his street life and overall mentality through his music. Although Myzery was classified as a rapper, he described his music as "read(ing) my diary over a beat with bars."<ref name="YCSM">{{cite web |title=Dead Inside |url=http://www.ycsmnews.com/myzery-releases-music-video-for-dead-inside// |date=May 12, 2012 |publisher=YCSM |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}</ref> He was involved in the rap group Boriqua Bee-Hive under the name Rhyme Recker. Eventually, his sister Nancy married rapper [[Robert Bruce (rapper)|Jumpsteady]], and the two had a daughter together named Sammy. Jumpsteady introduced Myzery to the [[Psychopathic Records]] family, and his brother [[Violent J]] of [[Insane Clown Posse]] took an interest in the Puerto Rican rapper, and offered him an outlet for his music in 1997.<ref name="BehindthePaint371">{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Joseph|authorlink=Violent J|author2=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey|title=ICP: Behind the Paint|url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol|url-access=registration|date=August 2003|edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records|location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/371 371–375]|chapter=Angels and Devils}}</ref>

Myzery's first widespread appearance with the label was a cameo in the music video for Insane Clown Posse's song [[Hokus Pokus (Insane Clown Posse song)|"Hokus Pokus"]]<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|title=IMDB on Myzery|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0617211/|year=2012|publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=October 2012}} off their 1997 album ''[[The Great Milenko]]''. He then went on tour with Insane Clown Posse, [[House of Krazees]], and [[Psycho Realm]]. In January 1998, the entire touring lineup was arrested at a [[Waffle House]] during a quarrel with a heckling customer, which had garnered the three acts media attention.<ref>{{cite web|title="ICP Pleads Guilty" – MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/350084/insane-clown-posse-plead-guilty/|date=June 10, 1998}}</ref> Myzery released his debut EP ''Para La Isla'' in February 1998, and it was Psychopathic Records' first solo album not released by an Insane Clown Posse member.<ref>{{cite web |title=Myzery Discogs |url=http://www.discogs.com/Myzery-Para-La-Isla/release/1823966 |year=2009 |publisher=Discogs |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}</ref><ref name="BehindthePaint371" /> Myzery also made an appearance on [[Twiztid]]'s (formerly House of Krazees) debut album ''[[Mostasteless]]'', but the track ("Meat Cleaver") was cut on the reissue of the album. The track later appeared on Twiztid's rarities compilation ''[[Cryptic Collection]]'' and the label's compilation ''[[Psychopathics from Outer Space|Psychopathics From Outer Space]]''.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |title=AllMusic Entry on Myzery |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/myzery-mn0000934985/songs |year=2012 |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref>

In 1999, Myzery appeared in the movie ''[[Big Money Hustlas]]'' as Green Willie<ref name="IMDB" /> and also was a member of the group [[Psychopathic Rydas]] as Twin Gatz. He appeared on their debut album ''[[Dumpin']]'' in 1999 on numerous tracks. In addition, the tracks from his debut EP appeared on multiple Psychopathic Records compilations and samplers. He also appeared at the earliest incarnation of [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]] (then known as Hellfire Wrestling). He was also a founding member of [[Dark Lotus]] alongside Twiztid and Insane Clown Posse, but no tracks were entirely recorded with him as a member. The initial follow-up to ''Para La Isla'' was planned to be titled simply ''Misery'', but the album was indefinitely shelved. From 1999 to 2001, Myzery focused on a project titled ''The Four Faces of Nay Nay''. The gimmick was conceived by Violent J, and Myzery had portrayed four different personalities for the album (Myzery, Diabloa, Dr. Giggles, and The Spanish Thug). Guest appearances by Insane Clown Posse and [[Ice-T]] was planned as well. The project was eventually cancelled, but a few tracks were released on the limited edition EPs ''4 Faces'' and ''DP, inc.'', and the limited edition compilation ''4 Faces of Myzery''.

Myzery was announced to appear at the initial [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] event in 2000, but ultimately did not appear. He made a return at the 2001 Gathering of the Juggalos, but after the performances, he had an altercation with labelmates Twiztid and [[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]] at a hotel. Violent J insisted that fighting within the family wasn't healthy, and Myzery distanced himself from Psychopathic Records.<ref name="LyricsatBJ">{{cite web |last=Encarnacion |first=Nene |authorlink=Myzery |title=Lyrics: Untwiztid |work=www.myzery2012.com |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p141Y4U9qZ0e |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref> The beef was later squashed years later. He continued to release albums independently, such as 2002's ''The Red Eye'' and 2003's ''Bad Influence''. Myzery also made a guest appearance on Jumpsteady's second album ''[[Master of the Flying Guillotine (album)|Master of the Flying Guillotine]]'' in 2005. From 2007 to 2009, rumors circulated on the internet that Myzery had died. Apparently, a friend of Myzery had created the rumor. But the intent wasn't to fake Myzery's death; rather, it was to signify that Myzery's rapping career was over. The rumor was invalidated and unappreciated by Myzery, causing severed ties within the crew.<ref>{{cite web|title="Faygo Luvers Interview" – Myzery Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPHL2NjTw9M|date=April 18, 2010}}</ref>

After the rumor was squashed, Myzery reappeared with the intent to continue rapping. His first independent release upon his return was the ''Heaven or Hell'' mixtape. He then announced that his newest album was to be titled ''The Demon Angel'', and he had made his return to the Gathering of the Juggalos in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=Myzery Photos From Gathering |url=http://www.myzery2012.com/ |date=August 1, 2012 |publisher=Poor Manz |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}</ref> In addition, his rare underground album ''Love/Hate'' became a free download on his website, along with a recording he did for the 2004 [[Puerto Rican Day Parade]]. Also, Myzery compiled tracks that he considered most worthy throughout his career, and released it as ''His.Story''. Myzery also started to collaborate with Psychopathic Records again. He appeared on [[DJ Clay]]'s 2013 mixtape ''[[A World Upside Down: The Mixxtape]]'', Insane Clown Posse's 2017 reissue of ''The Great Milenko'', and a 2017 Psychopathic Records EP with various artists titled ''Bloody Screams of 17'' (which was given away during Myzery's appearance at Hallowicked 2017 and later sold online).<ref>{{cite web |title=Myzery News |url=http://www.myzery2012.com/ |date=August 1, 2012 |publisher=Poor Manz |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}</ref> Myzery's comeback album ''The Demon Angel'' was originally announced in October 2010; however, 8 years later, it was finally released at the 2018 Gathering of the Juggalos, packaged together with ''Para La Isla 20th Anniversary Edition''. The first CD consisted of Myzery's debut EP ''Para La Isla'', along with five unreleased tracks that were recorded during the same era. The second CD consisted of ''The Demon Angel'' in its official and final capacity. The double disc bundle was released on Psychopathic Records, as it marked Myzery's return to his former label.

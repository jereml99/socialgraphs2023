== Career ==
One of New York's premier hip-hop artists on the turntables, DJ Hurricane fostered his skills alongside [[Run D.M.C.]] in the [[Hollis, Queens]] area of New York City. His first hip-hop experience was with Davy Dmx the first hip-hop DJ from Hollis. Hurricane became his rapper for The Solo Sounds crew who performed at block parties and Russell Simmons promotion events. He was also a member of the Hollis Crew. Hurricane began rhyming at the age of 13, [[Jam Master Jay]] and Hurricane were best friends in school.<ref name=Owen2003>Owen, Frank (2003). [https://web.archive.org/web/20130726024814/http://frankowen.net/golden-oldies/ The Last Days of Jam Master Jay], fxowen.com</ref>

When Jam Master Jay got the job to DJ for Run D.M.C. he asked Hurricane to come on tour. While serving as a bodyguard on the 1986 Raising Hell tour, he became friends with the Beastie Boys, who were the tour's opening act. Hurricane and Davy DMX collaborated and made ''Davy's Ride'' album in 1987. The next big tour The Together Forever Tour, with Run-DMC, The Beastie Boys and Davy DMX, saw Hurricane perform with all three acts every night. Hurricane later formed the Hollis, Queens-based novelty group The Afros along with DJ Kippy-O and Kool Tee.<ref name="whoz"/>  The Afros were the first group signed to Jam Master Jay's JMJ Records, releasing the single "Feel It" and the album ''Kickin' Afrolistics'' in 1990.<ref name="whoz"/>  They made cameos in various rap music videos and concerts before disbanding.<ref name="whoz"/>

When the Beastie Boys were stuck without a DJ they asked Hurricane to sit in and he did them a favor. It was not long before the Beasties returned the favor and offered Hurricane an opportunity to be their exclusive DJ.<ref name="Larkin90"/> That gig would last for 13 years. In 1993, along with the Beastie Boys, he contributed the track "It's The New Style" to the AIDS-benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. As the Beasties rose in fame with each successive album in the 1990s, Hurricane simultaneously reveled in the spotlight, releasing his first solo album in 1995 on [[Grand Royal]], titled ''[[The Hurra]]'' (guest artists include the Beastie Boys, [[MC Breed]], and [[Sen Dog]]).<ref name="Larkin90"/> The single "Stick 'em Up" was the first single on the CB4 movie 
soundtrack. Hurricane started his own production company, Don't Sleep Productions in 1999. DJ Hurricane also produced songs for MC Breed album funkdafied one of the songs featured George Clinton.

After having parted ways with the Beasties prior to their album ''[[Hello Nasty]]'' in 1998, Hurricane did co-write the song "Three MC'S and One DJ" for The Beastie Boys. Hurricane released his second album ''Severe Damage'' on Wiija Records in the UK.<ref name="Larkin90"/> It was only released in the UK and Asia. Hurricane's third solo album via [[TVT Records|TVT]], ''Don't Sleep'', which found him much more conceptually collected and with a broad scope of guest artists, including [[Kool G Rap]], [[Xzibit]], [[Scott Weiland]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Rah Digga]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[Ad-Rock]], [[Black Thought]], [[Big Gipp]], [[Hittman]] among others.

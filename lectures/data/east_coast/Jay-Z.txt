===2005–2007: ''Kingdom Come'' and ''American Gangster''===
[[File:Jay-Z concert (cropped).jpg|thumb|Jay-Z performing in 2006]]
On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's [[Power 105.1]] annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the "I Declare War" concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously "declared war" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1509668/09152005/jay_z.jhtml?headlines=true|title='I Declare War!'

At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans. The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous hip hop rivalry between Jay-Z and [[Nas]]. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z's "Dead Presidents" blended with Nas's song "The World is Yours".<ref name=mtvnews2>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512432/20051028/jay_z.jhtml|title=Jay-Z And Nas Put Beef To Sleep in Onstage Show of Unity|access-date=August 6, 2009|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|date=October 28, 2005|publisher=MTV News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715090002/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512432/20051028/jay_z.jhtml|archive-date=July 15, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jay-Z later addressed the case in his 2010 book ''Decoded'':

{{cquote|One night I went to Q-Tip's solo album release party and at some point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I approached him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, "No the fuck this nigga did not..." I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted. [...] There was no reason to put my life on the line, and the lives of everyone who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control. [...] I vowed to never allow myself to be in a situation like that again.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jay-Z|title=Decoded|url={{Google books|l2i0F2kSwwUC|Decoded|page=162|plainurl=yes}}|page=162|year=2010|publisher=[[Spiegel & Grau]]}}</ref>}}

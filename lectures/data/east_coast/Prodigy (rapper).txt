== Music career ==
=== 1995–1999: ''The Infamous,'' ''Hell on Earth'' and ''Murda Muzik'' ===
Initially compared to fellow rapper [[Nas]], who took a similar approach lyrically on his ''[[Illmatic]]'' album from 1994,<ref name="ambrosiaforheads">{{Cite news |url=http://ambrosiaforheads.com/2017/05/prodigy-nas-mobb-deep-influence-video/ |title=Prodigy Reveals Nas' Illmatic Was A Blueprint For Mobb Deep's The Infamous (Video) |last=Mester |first=Amanda |access-date=June 26, 2017 |work=Ambrosia for Heads |date=May 2, 2017}}</ref> Mobb Deep released ''[[The Infamous]]'' in 1995, which was certified Gold by the RIAA within the first two months of its release.<ref name="Vibe2">{{Cite magazine |title=What's love got to do with it? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA84 |magazine=Vibe |publisher=Vibe Media Group |date=Mar 2006 |volume=13 |page=84 |issn=1070-4701 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 1995 was also the year that Prodigy began to raise his solo profile, by providing a guest appearance on [[LL Cool J]]'s controversial "[[I Shot Ya (remix)]]".<ref name="genius.com">{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/277583|title=LL Cool J – I Shot Ya (Remix) Lyrics|website=Genius}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/06/prodigy-best-guest-verses/|title=Prodigy's 20 Best Guest Verses|website=Xxlmag.com|first=Max|last=Weinstein|date=June 21, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-illuminati-stole-the-mind-soul-and-body-of-hip-hop|title=The Daily Beast: How the Illuminati Stole the Mind, Soul, and Body of Hip-Hop|newspaper=The Daily Beast|first=Rob|last=Brotherton|date=January 2, 2016|quote="Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body/Secret society trying to keep they eye on me"}}</ref> The song became a minor part of the [[East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry]], due to [[Tupac Shakur]] believing the song to be a [[diss song|diss]] referring to his robbery/shooting in [[Manhattan, New York]] at Quad Recording Studios – singling out the song's title (which many assumed was connected to [[Biggie]]'s "[[Who Shot Ya?]]"), certain lyrics, and the timing of its release – the year after the shooting incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2010/09/tupac-talks-hit-em-vs-who-shot-ya-pg-2|title=Tupac Talks 'Hit Em Up' Vs.

Although the track was stated by Keith Murray to not have any lyrical shots aimed at Tupac, Mobb Deep responded in the following year to Tupac's "[[Hit Em Up]]" with "[[Drop a Gem on 'Em]]," a [[promotional single]] from their 1996 album ''[[Hell on Earth (Mobb Deep album)|Hell On Earth]]''. Ironically, "[[I Shot Ya]]" does feature a subliminal aim in Prodigy's verse to Murray, which continued friction that started sometime prior with an interlude from [[Mobb Deep]]'s 1995 ''[[The Infamous]]'' album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-the-infamous-prelude-lyrics#note-17995413|title=Genius – Mobb Deep:The Infamous Prelude Lyrics|website=Genius.com|author=<!--not stated-->}}</ref> The rivalry continued until sometime in 2012, when the two ended it by taking a picture together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@jmonkey/how-the-bang-still-reverberates-20-years-after-ll-cool-js-i-shot-ya-remix-15248dd9f7ce|title=How The Bang Still Reverberates 20 Years After LL Cool J's 'I Shot Ya' Remix|website=Medium.com|first=Jaap|last=van der Doelen|date=April 20, 2017}}</ref>

A year and a half later, at the end of 1996, Prodigy and Havoc released ''[[Hell on Earth (Mobb Deep album)|Hell on Earth]]'', which debuted at number six on [[SoundScan]].<ref name="F.E.D.S.

== Feuds ==
=== West Coast ===
From 1995 to 1997, the media-fueled "[[East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry]]" was occurring. This started when [[Tha Dogg Pound]] released "New York, New York," to which Mobb Deep took offense, as, in addition to the lyrics, the song's music video portrayed New York buildings being stomped on by Dogg Pound members. In response, Mobb Deep with [[Capone-N-Noreaga]] and [[Tragedy Khadafi]] released "LA, LA".<ref name="mtv">{{Cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1662452/prodigy-mobb-deep-tupac-nore/ |title=Prodigy Didn't Want To Respond To Tupac Dis, N.O.R.E.

=== Def Squad ===
On ''The Infamous'' track "The Infamous Prelude", Prodigy made remarks about rappers who rap about "smoking weed" and talk about "space shit".<ref name=keith>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/013105/|title=Mixtape Monday: Game and 50 On Fame-Haters; The Mobb Deep/Keith Murray Beef Goes On|author=Reid, Shaheem |author2=Joseph Patel |author3=Rahman Dukes |author4=Curtis Waller |author5=Kimberly Rufen-Blanchette|publisher=MTV|date=January 28, 2005|access-date=March 17, 2009}}</ref> [[Def Squad]] took offense from this, but the feud was settled when Prodigy and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]] met at a video shoot.<ref name=keith /> The feud was rekindled when Prodigy again referenced "space shit" in his appearance on [[LL Cool J]]'s "[[I Shot Ya]]" which also featured Murray. Murray saw Prodigy at a club one night and punched him.<ref name=keith /> Prodigy recalled the altercation and threatened Murray in the song "In the Long Run" on ''Hell on Earth''. Murray released a song "Call My Name" on his ''[[Enigma (Keith Murray album)|Enigma]]'' album dissing Mobb Deep. The feud seemed to die down until Prodigy dissed Murray again in his 2004 song "Bad Blood." Murray has responded with numerous songs since.<ref name=keith /> The feud has since died down, with the two sharing a photograph together with [[Busta Rhymes]] on social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.20133/title.prodigy-keith-murray-appear-photographed-together-after-years-of-beef|title=Prodigy & Keith Murray Appear Photographed Together After Years Of Beef|date=June 17, 2012|website=HipHopDX.com|access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref> On Twitter, The reconciliation was confirmed by Prodigy in response to the photo not long after.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=PRODIGYMOBBDEEP|number=214272924272697345|date=June 17, 2012|title=keith murry ....dope|author=}}</ref>

=== Saigon ===
During an interview, Prodigy stated that he did not like [[Saigon (rapper)|Saigon]] and [[Tru-Life]] (along with many other rappers).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wutang-corp.com/forum/showthread.php?35149-Prodigy-Explains-Beef-With-Saigon |title=Prodigy Explains Beef With Saigon |website=The Wu-Tang Corp |access-date=June 25, 2017 |archive-date=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203234204/https://www.wutang-corp.com/forum/showthread.php?35149-Prodigy-Explains-Beef-With-Saigon |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On the night of September 19, 2007, after an impromptu performance by Saigon during a Mobb Deep show, words were exchanged between Saigon and Prodigy.<ref>[http://www.ballerstatus.com/2007/09/20/saigon-mobb-deep-get-into-physical-altercation-during-music-showcase-in-new-york/ Saigon, Mobb Deep Get Into Physical Altercation During Music Showcase In New York] BallerStatus.com (September 20, 2007).

=== Crooked I ===
While in prison, Prodigy wrote a letter about his disillusionment with hip hop and rappers. He directly referenced [[Crooked I]]'s name in the letter, commenting,

{{blockquote|Vibe says 920,000 people voted for it. I would personally b*tch slap all 920,000 of these voters if given the opportunity. Who in the f*ck picked Crooked I, Flo Rida and Rich Boy? How did Vibe approve this?}}

Crooked I responded in a blog entry, and challenged Prodigy to a one-on-one fight upon the rapper's release.<ref>{{cite web |last=Langhorne |first=Cyrus |url=http://www.sohh.com/2009/03/crooked_i_lashes_back_at.html |title=Crooked I Lashes Back At Prodigy, "Fight Me One On One" |publisher=Sohh.Com |date=March 10, 2009 |access-date=March 30, 2012 |archive-date=February 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217115444/http://www.sohh.com/2009/03/crooked_i_lashes_back_at.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Following Prodigy's death, Crooked I paid tribute in honor of him by posting an image of him on Instagram.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BVkoAy1F_5x/|title=Instagram post by GOD BLESS THE KXNG • Jun 20, 2017 at 6:57pm UTC|website=Instagram|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>

=== Havoc ===
In July 2012, Prodigy's musical partner, [[Havoc (musician)|Havoc]], wrote a series of derogatory comments about Prodigy on [[Twitter]], including accusing Prodigy of engaging in homosexual relationships in prison.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/1690720/mobb-deep-havoc-prodigy-gay-tweets/ "Mobb Deep's Havoc Confirms He Sent 'Gay' Prodigy Tweets"].

== Illuminati theory ==
{{See also|Illuminati in popular culture}}
Some hip hop music has been inspired by the theory that a powerful international secret society exists. Often it is referred to as the [[Illuminati]], after the Bavarian secret society founded in 1776. ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' magazine has claimed it was Prodigy who started the interest in the theory.<ref name="complex.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/11/hip-hop-illuminati-obsession|title=Why Is Rap So Obsessed With the Illuminati?|website=Complex|access-date=June 26, 2017}}</ref> Prodigy had often spoken publicly against the alleged international secret society during his life.<ref>{{cite web|author=C.

Prodigy rhymed about a [[secret society]] in his collaboration with [[LL Cool J]] in the song "[[I Shot Ya (Remix)]]", from the 1995 album ''[[Mr. Smith (album)|Mr. Smith]]''.<ref name="genius.com" /> From prison in 2007, not long before the release of ''H.N.I.C. Part 2'', Prodigy wrote and published an open letter to [[Jay-Z]] in which he made some cryptic allegations alluding to the theory.<ref name="complex.com" /> In 2008, Prodigy titled a song "Illuminati", from ''H.N.I.C. Part 2''.<ref name="auto" /> In his final solo album released during his life, ''The Hegelian Dialectic'' (2017), Prodigy also referred to the theory.<ref name="auto" /> It was reported that Prodigy was working on a musical about his Illuminati theory at the time of his death.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://allhiphop.com/2017/06/21/prodigy-was-reportedly-working-on-a-musical-about-the-illuminati-before-his-death/|title=Prodigy Was Reportedly Working On A Musical About The Illuminati Before His Death|first=Yohance|last=Kyles|date=June 21, 2017|website=Allhiphop}}</ref>

== Illness and death ==
In an interview with ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' in November 2000, Prodigy spoke about what inspired him to directly address his battle with [[sickle cell disease]] in his song "You Can Never Feel My Pain", from his debut studio album ''H.N.I.C''. He attributed his nihilism to the "permanent physical suffering" caused by his lifelong battle with the condition.<ref name="Vibe">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-CcEAAAAMBAJ&q=King&pg=PA136|title=King Of Pain |date=November 2000 |first=David|last=Bry |work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref>

On June 20, 2017, it was reported that Prodigy had died at the Spring Valley Medical Center in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], while hospitalized for complications related to his sickle-cell anemia. He was performing in the Art of Rap Tour in Las Vegas with Havoc, [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]], [[KRS-One]], and [[Ice-T]] when he was hospitalized.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/06/prodigy-dies-at-42/ |title=Prodigy dies at 42 |date=June 21, 2017 |first=Max |last=Weinstein |work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] |access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref>

According to a coroner's report, Prodigy was admitted to Spring Valley Medical Center after suffering a significant medical episode arising from his life-long battle with sickle-cell anemia. Days later, on the morning of June 20, he was found unresponsive by hospital staff. It was reported at the time that Prodigy died from accidental choking.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mobb Deep rapper Prodigy died of accidental choking |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/mobb-deep-rapper-prodigy-died-accidental-choking-article-1.3382073|newspaper=NY Daily News|date=August 3, 2017}}</ref> The complaint, which was filed on behalf of the family by the Gage Law Firm, alleges that the Spring Valley hospital breached their duty of care for Prodigy by "failing to maintain a working IV access," and by "failing to continuously monitor oxygen levels" as ordered by physicians in the hospital, and that those failures led to Prodigy's death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thesource.com/2018/06/21/source-exclusive-prodigy-family-sues-hospital-and-physician-for-wrongful-death/|title=Source Exclusive: Prodigy's Family Sues For Wrongful Death|website=Thesource.com|date=June 21, 2018|access-date=March 31, 2020}}</ref>

'''George Carroll''', better known as '''Slaine,''' is an American rapper and actor. Born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where he spent his childhood and teenage years, Carroll moved to [[New York City]] in the mid-1990s, where he adopted the moniker of Slaine and started to rap and record hip-hop. In the early 2000s, Carroll became a growing figure in the Boston hip-hop scene, releasing several mixtapes, and the LP ''Stereotypez'' (2007) with his group [[Special Teamz]]. Later, ''[[A Brand You Can Trust]]'' (2009) was released, by the rap [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[La Coka Nostra]], where Carroll is joined by [[Ill Bill]], and [[House of Pain]]. Carroll’s first solo album ''[[A World with No Skies|A World With No Skies 2.0.]]'' (2011) peaked at 33 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums it, 22 on the Top Rap Albums, 29 on US Independent Albums, and 4 on Top Heatseekers.

Carroll’s subsequent albums with La Coka Nostra were ''[[Masters of the Dark Arts]]'' (2012) and ''[[To Thine Own Self Be True]]'' (2016). On his own he followed up with ''The Boston Project'' (2013), ''[[The King of Everything Else]]'' (2014), ''[[Anti-Hero (Slaine and Termanology album)|Anti-Hero]]'' (2017), ''One Day'' (2019), and ''The Things We Can't Forgive'' (2021).

While rising on the hip-hop scene, Carroll became an actor. For [[Ben Affleck]]'s directorial film debut, ''[[Gone Baby Gone]]'' (2007), he thought Carroll had the right look for a part and auditioned him successfully. However before Carroll was completely onboard, Affleck had to do some additional convincing, since the producers were reluctant to hire a first time actor. A few years later, Affleck rehired Carroll for the movie ''[[The Town (2010 film)|The Town]]'' (2010). Together with the rest of the cast, they won Best ensemble cast at the 2010 National Board of Review, and Washington DC Area Film Critics Association Awards. Carroll continued acting in motion pictures with roles in ''[[Killing Them Softly]]'' (2012), ''[[Girl House]]'' (2014), ''[[Central Intelligence]]'' (2016), [[Wheelman (film)|''Wheelman'']] (2017), etc.

== Early life ==
George Carroll was born in the [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. His family often moved between the neighborhoods of [[South Boston]], [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]], and [[Roslindale]]. He started writing rap lyrics in 1986, being influenced by the [[Beastie Boys]], [[LL Cool J]], and [[Kool Moe Dee]]. However, his first goal was to become a filmmaker.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Burke |first=Matthew M. |title=For rapper Slaine, hard times are gone, baby, gone |url=https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/entertainment/music/2008/06/28/for-rapper-slaine-hard-times/52361081007/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230511031003/https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/entertainment/music/2008/06/28/for-rapper-slaine-hard-times/52361081007/ |archive-date=May 11, 2023 |access-date=2022-07-17 |website=Cape Cod Times |language=en-US}}</ref> Carroll said that he moved to [[New York City]] in 1996.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal |last=Mawdsley |first=Melissa |date=October 7, 2011 |title=Slaine takes stage at MesaTheatre and Club on Oct. 8 |journal=The Daily Sentinel |pages=Out & About 7}}</ref> During this time he studied film at the School of Visual Arts in [[Manhattan]], but was let go after getting into an altercation with a staff member. Carroll turned his direction toward hip-hop performing his raps at open-mike sessions and street corners.<ref name=":6" /> Eventually while recording a demo in the studio of the rap group [[Lordz of Brooklyn]], Carroll said that member [[Kaves]] nicknamed him Slaine after an Irish comic book character.<ref name=":7" /> Afterward, Carroll lived between Boston and New-York.<ref name=":6" />

== Career ==

=== 2004 to 2011: rise to prominence and breakthrough ===
In late 2004, the creation of the rap [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[La Coka Nostra]] started when hip-hop artist [[Danny Boy (rapper)|Danny Boy O'Connor]] was mentoring two up and coming artists which included Carroll. O'Connor brought them to meet his former DJ Leor Diamant ([[DJ Lethal]]) from his previous group [[House of Pain]]. They decided to make a group, however O'Connor felt that there was a void and asked experienced rapper William Braunstein ([[Ill Bill]]) to join. The group's name came about, when O'Connor teased other members after they had a night out. The group started releasing music on [[Myspace|MySpace]], and went viral. Eventually, another former House of Pain member Erik Schrody ([[Everlast]]) showed interest to join the group. By 2006, the group consisted of O'Connor, Carroll, Diamant, Braunstein, and Schrody (who left some time after the first album was released).{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}}

During this time, Carroll was getting noticed as a talented rapper in the Boston underground hip-hop scene. He was part of a group named [[Special Teamz]] alongside artists Jaysaun and [[Ed O.G.]]<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Capobianco |first=Ken |date=May 25, 2007 |title=A show of unity from area hip-hop acts |journal=The Boston Globe |volume=271 |pages=D 17}}</ref> In a 2005 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article, he is described as “one of the city’s most talented hip-hop artist, who exudes mass appeal”.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Burke |first=Matthew |date=August 18, 2005 |title=Rapper Renaissance |journal=The Boston Globe |volume=268 |pages=Calendar 5}}</ref>

In 2005, he released the mixtape ''The White Man Is the Devil, Vol. 1.''<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal |last=Caballero |first=Martin |date=July 11, 2014 |title=Clean break |journal=The Boston Globe |pages=24 G}}</ref>

In 2007, Carroll had his first acting role in [[Ben Affleck]]'s ''[[Gone Baby Gone]].''<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gone Baby Gone |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/gone-baby-gone/2000145825/ |access-date=2022-07-11 |website=TVGuide.com |language=en}}</ref> Reading a newspaper article about his music triggered Affleck's initial interest in casting him. At 9 am the next day, Affleck started to phone Carroll, who had gone to bed two hours earlier and missed all his calls.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pai |first=Tanya |date=2011-07-19 |title=Person of Interest: Slaine |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/2011/07/19/person-of-interest-slaine/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=Boston Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> Carroll said "My picture was in the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' talking about what I was doing with my music. I woke up one afternoon, and I had 66 missed phone calls.

Carroll explained "I thought I wasn't going to get (the role) because they took so long to get back to me, but it turns out Ben was just convincing the studio to take a chance on me despite my lack of acting experience. I was in L.A. recording with La Coka Nostra when I got the call and was obviously ecstatic."<ref name=":6" /> Affleck explained his reasoning by saying “it’s really great to hire people with whom an audience isn’t overly familiar, because audiences have developed expectations and kind of anticipate what an actor might do if they’ve seen them a bunch".<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Oral History of ‘The Town’ |url=https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/9/16/21438005/the-town-oral-history-10-year-anniversary |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=www.theringer.com |language=en}}</ref> Released on October 19, 2007, the film grossed $20.3 million in the U.S. and Canada and $14.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $34.6 million against its $19 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gone Baby Gone |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2153022977/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref>

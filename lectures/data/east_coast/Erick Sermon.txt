==Career==
Sermon started professionally in 1986 as a producer and artist of the hip hop group EPMD. He began recording solo albums for [[Def Jam]] in 1993; in 1997, he rejoined EPMD. The following year, Sermon, [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Murray]] and [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] recorded a cover version of "[[Rapper's Delight]]" by the [[Sugarhill Gang]]. EPMD disbanded a second time in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/39838-Erick-Sermon?filter_anv=0&type=Credits|title=Erick Sermon (credits)|website=Discogs|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>

In 2000, Sermon moved over to [[J Records]], and released the album ''[[Music (Erick Sermon album)|Music]]'' the following year. The album's first single, "Music", featured guest vocals from [[Marvin Gaye]], which Sermon reportedly culled from unreleased recordings found in a small record shop in London. "Music" went on to become Sermon's highest-charting song, peaking at number 22 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 2 on the R&B [[record chart|chart]]. Sermon's second album on J Records, ''[[React (Erick Sermon album)|React]]'', was released in 2002. ''React's'' title track peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, but the album sold poorly and Sermon was dropped from the label in 2003. In a June 30, 2004 interview with ''HipHopDX.com'', Sermon told music journalist [[Bayer Mack]], "Things weren't right at J Records. [[Clive Davis]] and them don't believe in promotion. When Puffy had [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]] at [[Arista Records|Arista]], it was him doing all the [promotional] work." He also stated [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Wyclef Jean]] had similar issues with J Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.300/title.erick-sermon-a-timeless-sermon|title=Erick Sermon: A Timeless Sermon|last=Macks|first=Beta|date=June 29, 2004|website=HipHopDX|language=en-US|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>

Sermon went on to establish his Def Squad imprint with [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal Records]] and released his sixth solo album, ''[[Chilltown, New York]]'', in 2004. The album was powered by the single "Feel It" (which contained a sample of reggae/R&B singer [[Sean Paul]]), a song which became a success in the United States.

In an interview, he stated that he was going to step aside and try to get upcoming artists in the spotlight. However, Sermon has not stopped in the [[music industry]], as he produced the song "Goldmine" on [[Busta Rhymes]]' album, ''[[The Big Bang (Busta Rhymes album)|The Big Bang]]'' in 2006. Soon after, Sermon has recorded "Don't Make No Sense" with [[Def Squad]]. He also collaborated with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and produced a few songs on the album ''[[Red Gone Wild]]'' while also making an appearance with Def Squad member Keith Murray.

In early 2008, Sermon and Smith started their own record label called EP Records, distributed by RBS/Universal Music Group. The seventh EPMD album, ''[[We Mean Business (album)|We Mean Business]]'', came out in December 2008.

Sermon was featured in the final episode of ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'' in a freestyle session featuring artists such as [[Rakim]], [[KRS-One]], [[Chubb Rock]], [[MC Serch]] and [[Craig Mack]].
In 2018, Sermon teamed up with [[Lost Boyz]]' own [[Mr Cheeks]] & broadcaster Ryan Verneuille to become the executive producer on their FM radio program, "The Ryan Show".

Sermon is part of [[Tracklib|Tracklib's]] Creators Advisory Board.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketscreener.com/news/Tracklib-Launches-Today-Forever-Changing-the-Way-Music-is-Made--26323539/|title=Tracklib : Launches Today, Forever Changing the Way Music is Made|website=Marketscreener.com|language=en|access-date=September 5, 2019}}</ref>

Rakim is considered a transformative figure in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] for raising the bar for MC technique higher than it had ever been.<ref name=ALLMUSIC /> Rakim helped to pioneer the use of [[internal rhymes]] and [[multisyllabic rhymes]], and he was among the first to demonstrate the possibilities of sitting down to write intricately crafted lyrics packed with clever word choices and metaphors rather than the more improvisational styles and simpler rhyme patterns that predominated before him.<ref name=ALLMUSIC />  Rakim is also credited with creating the overall shift from the more simplistic old school flows to more complex flows.{{sfn|Kool Moe Dee|2003|p=224}}  Rapper [[Kool Moe Dee]] explained that before Rakim, the term 'flow' wasn't widely used – "Rakim is basically the inventor of flow. We were not even using the word flow until Rakim came along. It was called rhyming, it was called cadence, but it wasn't called flow. Rakim created flow!"{{sfn|Kool Moe Dee|2003|p=328}} Rakim released four albums with [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Eric B.]]: ''[[Paid in Full (album)|Paid in Full]]'' (1987), ''[[Follow the Leader (Eric B. & Rakim album)|Follow the Leader]]'' (1988), ''[[Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em]]'' (1990) and ''[[Don't Sweat the Technique]]'' (1992).  He has released three solo albums: ''[[The 18th Letter]]'' (1997), ''[[The Master (Rakim album)|The Master]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Seventh Seal (Rakim album)|The Seventh Seal]]'' (2009).

==Early life==
Rakim is the nephew of the late American [[R&B]] singer and actress [[Ruth Brown]]. He grew up in [[Wyandanch, New York]] on [[Long Island]]. He wrote his first rhyme at seven years old, about the cartoon character [[Mickey Mouse]]. He initially aspired to play professional [[Gridiron football|football]]. He was a [[quarterback]] on his high school football team.

However, after being introduced to local DJ Eric B. by his friend Alvin Toney, he began writing lyrics to fit Eric's instrumentals and chose instead to focus on a career in music. Then known as '''Kid Wizard''', he made his first recordings live at Wyandanch High School in the year 1985.<ref name= "ALLMUSIC" /><ref name=Feature>{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/2009/11/21/120633180/rakim-the-mc-reveals-his-seventh-seal |title=Rakim: The MC Reveals His 'Seventh Seal'| date= November 21, 2009| website= NPR.org| access-date=April 30, 2020| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190415082828/https://www.npr.org/2009/11/21/120633180/rakim-the-mc-reveals-his-seventh-seal|archive-date=April 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theshadowleague.com/rap-legend-rakim-reveals-his-nfl-dreams/ | title = Rap Legend Rakim Reveals His NFL Dreams|date = March 13, 2020 | website= theshadowleague.com |  publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>

Rakim was initially introduced to the [[Nation of Islam]] in 1986; he later joined [[The Nation of Gods and Earths]] (also known as the 5 Percent Nation) and adopted the [[Rakim (name)|Arabic name Rakim]] Allah. He also chose to use “Rakim Allah” as his stage name, although it was most often shortened to simply “Rakim”.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ahearn|first=Charlie|title=The Five Percent Solution| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WwhU7vQ5ancC|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|location=San Francisco |date=February 1991 |volume= 6|issue=11|page=56|access-date=October 29, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140108003409/http://books.google.com/books?id=WwhU7vQ5ancC| archive-date= January 8, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> During his career he has been nicknamed the "God MC" because of his acclaimed status as an MC and a reference to the "[[Allah]]" in his stage name, which is the Arabic word for [[God]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stewart |first=Shelby |date=2021-04-12 |title= 'The God MC' Rakim reflects on Southern hip-hop and the road ahead |url=https://www.chron.com/culture/music/article/The-God-MC-Rakim-houston-Southern-hip-hop-rapper-16086689.php |access-date=2022-10-01 |website= [[Chron.com]] |language= en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= adminnewspack |date=2022-03-03 |title=The God MC, Rakim Allah, commemorates physicalday |url= http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2022/03/03/the-god-mc-rakim-allah-commemorates-physicalday/ |access-date=2022-10-01 |website=New York Amsterdam News |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Stewart |first=Shelby |date=2021-04-12 |title='The God MC' Rakim reflects on Southern hip-hop and the road ahead |url=https://www.chron.com/culture/music/article/The-God-MC-Rakim-houston-Southern-hip-hop-rapper-16086689.php |access-date=2022-10-01 |website=Chron.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Career==
===Pairing with Eric B. (1985–1992)===
{{Main|Eric B. & Rakim}}
First meeting in 1985, Eric B. and Rakim went on to release four studio albums before their separation in 1992. The duo were described by journalist [[Tom Terrell (journalist)|Tom Terrell]] of [[NPR]] as "the most influential DJ/MC combo in contemporary pop music period",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Eric-B-Rakim-Biography/3B889685EFA7D988482568A500200208|title=Eric B. & Rakim Biography|publisher=Sing365.com|access-date=July 5, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319005549/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Eric-B-Rakim-Biography/3B889685EFA7D988482568A500200208|archive-date=March 19, 2013}}</ref> while the editors of [[About.com]] ranked them as No. 4 on their list of the 10 Greatest Hip-Hop Duos of All-Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/artist1/tp/GreatestRapDuos.htm|title=10 Greatest Hip-Hop Duos of All-Time – Top 10 Hip-Hop Duos|publisher=Rap.about.com|date=June 23, 2013|access-date=July 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515190317/http://rap.about.com/od/artist1/tp/GreatestRapDuos.htm|archive-date=May 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> They were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2011, although they did not make the final selection.<ref name="Rockhall">{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/pressroom/announcements/2012-nominees/|title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Announces 2012 Nominees for Induction.

==== 1986–87: Beginnings and classic debut ====

{{further|Paid in Full (album)}}
After Rakim responded to Eric B.'s search for "New York's top MC",<ref name="ogg">Ogg, Alex (2002). ''The Men Behind Def Jam: The Radical Rise of Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin''. p. 105. Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|0-7119-8873-0}}</ref> Eric B.'s friend and roommate [[Marley Marl]] allowed them to use his home studio. The first tracks they recorded—"[[Eric B. Is President]]" and "My Melody"—were released as a single/b-side on the independent Zakia Records in 1986. After [[Def Jam Recordings]] founder [[Russell Simmons]] heard the single, the duo were signed to [[Island Records]] and began recording the album in [[Manhattan]]'s Power Play Studios in early 1987.<ref name="ogg" />

On July 7, 1987, the duo released their debut album, ''[[Paid in Full (album)|Paid in Full]]'', on the [[Island Records|Island]]-subsidiary label [[4th & B'way Records]]. The album peaked at No. 58 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and produced five singles: "Eric B. Is President", "[[I Ain't No Joke]]", "[[I Know You Got Soul (Eric B. & Rakim song)|I Know You Got Soul]]", "Move the Crowd", and "[[Paid in Full (Eric B. & Rakim song)|Paid in Full]]".<ref name="charts">"[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r27822/charts-awards/billboard-single| pure_url=yes}} Allmusic – "Paid in Full" > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles]". Allmusic. Accessed August 4, 2008.</ref>

====1988–89: Sophomore peak====
{{further|Follow the Leader (Eric B. & Rakim album)}}

While its singles attained moderate success, ''Follow the Leader'' performed better on [[Record chart|music charts]] than Eric B. & Rakim's debut album and reached number 22 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Pop Albums]] chart. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for shipments in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States. Released during [[Golden age hip hop|hip hop's "golden age"]], the album was well received by critics and has since been recognized by music writers as one of the most groundbreaking and influential hip hop albums of all time. American author [[William Jelani Cobb]] wrote of the album's significance, "On the heels of ''Paid in Full'', Eric B. & Rakim delivered a full clip of album titled ''Follow the Leader'' in 1988. Featuring a broader spectrum of sounds than the James Brown samples that had defined the initial release, ''Follow the Leader'' saw Rakim at his most lyrically fierce, issuing deft and death threats on such tracks as 'Microphone Fiend,' 'Lyrics of Fury,' and the nearly felonious 'No Competition.' The release marked the high point in the collaboration between the two and prefaced the long slide they faced in the 1990s."<ref>Cobb (2006), p. 142.</ref>

==== 1990–92: Final albums and dissolution ====
''[[Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em]]'', released in 1990, was Eric B. & Rakim's third album. This album saw the duo's sound develop further, with Rakim adopting a deeper, more aggressive tone of voice, as well as more mature and serious subject matter. Musically, the production ranges from smoother soulful tracks such as "In the Ghetto" to the hard-edged assault of the title track. Though it could not support singles as popular as the duo's previous albums, it is considered by many to be the duo's most coherent album. It is one of the few albums to have received a "five-mic" rating from ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''. In 1998, the album was selected as one of ''The Source''{{'}}s 100 Best Rap Albums. The back cover features a dedication to the memories of Rakim's father William and producer [[Paul C.]],<ref>[http://fatlacemagazine.uproxx.com/?p=1633]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> who had worked on many of the album's tracks before his murder in July 1989. His protégé [[Large Professor]] completed his work. Neither receive credit in the album's notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crunkster.abstractdynamics.org/archives/003807.html|title=CRUNKSTER: Traveling at the Speed of Thought|publisher=Crunkster.abstractdynamics.org|date=August 5, 2004|access-date=March 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724220222/http://crunkster.abstractdynamics.org/archives/003807.html|archive-date=July 24, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nodfactor.com/2008/09/29/420] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101125040/http://www.nodfactor.com/2008/09/29/420|date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>

In 1992, Eric B & Rakim released their fourth and final album, ''[[Don't Sweat the Technique]]''. The title track was a minor radio hit.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} "Casualties of War" was also released as a single. "[[Know the Ledge]]" first appeared in the film ''[[Juice (1992 film)|Juice]]'' under the title "Juice (Know the Ledge)". However, Eric B. refused to sign MCA's release contract, fearful that Rakim would abandon him. This led to a long, complicated court battle involving the two musicians and MCA. The legal wrangling eventually led to the duo dissolving completely.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

===Solo-career (1993–present)===

====1993–2003: Legal issues, solo debut, and Aftermath stint====
{{further|The 18th Letter}}
[[File:Rakim-02-mika.jpg|thumb|right|Rakim performing in Hamburg, Germany, June 3, 1998]]

After his breaking up his partnership with Eric B. in early-1993, Rakim kept a low profile, only making one notable appearance on the soundtrack to the 1993 film ''[[Gunmen (1994 film)|Gunmen]]''. A reshuffling in MCA caused Rakim to be dropped from the label in 1994. As Rakim continued to struggle with legal problems, he secured a deal with [[Universal Records]] and began recording his solo debut album ''[[The 18th Letter]]'' in 1996. In November 1997, the album ''The 18th Letter'' was released. Expectations were high for Rakim, as the album debuted at #4 on the [[Billboard 200]] and was certified Gold by the [[RIAA]].

In June 1999, Rakim appeared on three tracks of "[[The Seduction of Claude Debussy]]" by [[Art of Noise]]. [[AllMusic]]'s Keith Farley notes that "the album charts the artistic use of sampled [[breakbeat]]s – pioneered by the Art of Noise themselves – with nods to '80s hip-hop plus their '90s equivalent, [[drum'n'bass]]."<ref>"Farley, Keith" [https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-seduction-of-claude-debussy-mw0000239886] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724032127/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-seduction-of-claude-debussy-mw0000239886|date=July 24, 2018}} ''allmusic.com''. Retrieved July 23, 2018.</ref>

In November 1999, Rakim released ''[[The Master (Rakim album)|The Master]]'', which received good reviews but sold poorly.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Rakim was signed to [[Dr. Dre]]'s [[Aftermath Entertainment]] record label in 2000,<ref>Elon Johnson and Heather Parry (October 27, 2000). "[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428236/20001027/dr_dre.jhtml Rakim Signs With Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123190654/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428236/20001027/dr_dre.jhtml |date=November 23, 2009 }}". ''[[MTV]]''. Retrieved January 24, 2008.</ref> for work on an album tentatively titled ''Oh, My God''. The album underwent numerous changes in artistic direction and personnel and was delayed several times. While working on the album, Rakim made guest appearances on four Aftermath projects, including the hit single "[[Addictive (song)|Addictive]]" by [[Truth Hurts (singer)|Truth Hurts]] and its remix (which featured a different Rakim verse from the main version), the [[Dr. Dre]]-produced "The Watcher Part 2" by [[Jay-Z]], and [[Eminem]]'s ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' soundtrack album with the track "R.A.K.I.M".

However, Rakim left the label in 2003 and ''Oh, My God'' was indefinitely shelved.<ref>"[http://www.thaformula.com/rakim_guess_whos_back_thaformula_music.html Q & A w/ Rakim: Guess Who's Back?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229225023/http://thaformula.com/rakim_guess_whos_back_thaformula_music.html |date=December 29, 2007 }}" ''ThaFormula.com'' (2005).

{{blockquote|The number 7 has a lot of significance. The seventh letter of the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Supreme Alphabet|Supreme]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> alphabet is G—that stands for God.

Some call it the end of the world, but for me it's the end of the old and the beginning of the new. By me naming my album that, I'm using it metaphorically in hip hop. I'm hoping to kill the old state of hip hop and start with the new.<ref name="7Seal">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1048255/rakim-wrapping-new-cd-touring-with-ghostface|title=Rakim Wrapping New CD, Touring With Ghostface|date=July 10, 2011|website=[[About.com]]|publisher=Henry Adaso|access-date=July 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411152445/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1048255/rakim-wrapping-new-cd-touring-with-ghostface|archive-date=April 11, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

In another interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' in 2009, he stated,
{{blockquote|The seals are from the Bible—Revelations and the coming of the Apocalypse. But Islam, Judaism, Christianity—all have a version of the same events. The Lion of Judah breaks the seven seals one by one, each imparting knowledge and inflicting catastrophe, ending with seven trumpets announcing the end of Times. After the Apocalypse, God rises from the ashes to recreate the Kingdom, taking only the greatest elements from the past with them. When you look at Hip-Hop, I want to do that: to spit fire and take our best from the ashes to build our kingdom; to recognize all the regional styles, conscious lyrics, the tracks, underground, mainstream, the way we treat each other. Lose the garbage and rebuild our scene. I've always tried to insert consciousness and spirituality in my records, interpreting the writings of all cultures and religions and how they apply to life in modern times.<ref name="billboardnews">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268107/rakim-ready-to-release-the-seventh-seal|title=Rakim Ready To Release 'The Seventh Seal'|last=Mitchell|first=Gail|date=July 13, 2009|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=July 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129115715/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268107/rakim-ready-to-release-the-seventh-seal|archive-date=November 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

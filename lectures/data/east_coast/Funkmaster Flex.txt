==Radio career==

He later left KISS, and spent a brief period at 107.5 [[WBLS]]-FM.<ref name="Shapiro">Shapiro, Peter (2005) ''The Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-263-8}}, p.149-150</ref> In the early 1990s, Flex made club appearances at many of Vito Bruno's operated nightclubs. Bruno later convinced Joel Salkowitz, a regional vice president of Hot 97, to begin airing live broadcasts from clubs where he was performing. When they realized the resurgence of Hip Hop was coming fast from its decline in the eighties, they increased the hours of this urban radio programming.<ref name="PayBack">Charnas, Dan (2010).

With this, Hot 97 became the first pop station in New York to showcase rap. Flex has been with Hot 97 ever since, and currently airs nationally through syndication during weeknights and weekends.<ref name="PayBack"/> He is well known for his signature "bomb drop" sound effect over records.

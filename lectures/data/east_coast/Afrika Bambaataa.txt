In May 2016, Bambaataa left his position as head of the [[Universal Zulu Nation]] due to multiple allegations of [[child sexual abuse]] dating as far back as the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://atlantablackstar.com/2016/05/09/afrika-bambaataa-steps-down-as-zulu-nation-leader-amid-reports-of-child-sexual-assault/|title=Afrika Bambaataa Steps Down as Zulu Nation Leader Amid Reports of Child Sexual Assault|first=Kiersten|last=Willis|newspaper=Atlanta Black Star|date=May 9, 2016|access-date=January 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190504150642/https://atlantablackstar.com/2016/05/09/afrika-bambaataa-steps-down-as-zulu-nation-leader-amid-reports-of-child-sexual-assault/|archive-date=May 4, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Born Lance Taylor to [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] and [[Barbadians|Barbadian]] immigrants,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=An3xv7mXeQAC |title=In Search of the Black Fantastic: Politics and Popular Culture in the Post-Civil Rights Era|last=Iton|first=Richard|date=2006|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-972083-5|page=250|language=en}}</ref> Bambaataa grew up in the [[Bronx River Houses|Bronx River Projects]], with an [[activist]] mother and uncle. As a child, he was exposed to the [[Black theology|black liberation movement]] and witnessed debates between his mother and uncle regarding the conflicting ideologies in the movement. He was exposed to his mother's extensive and eclectic record collection.<ref name=chang /> [[Street gang|Gangs]] in the area became the law, clearing their [[wikt:turf|turf]] of drug dealers, assisting with community health programs and both fighting and partying to keep members and turf.<ref name= chang />

Bambaataa was a member of the [[Black Spades]]. He quickly rose to the position of "warlord" in one of the divisions. As warlord, it was his job to build ranks and expand the turf of the young Spades. He was not afraid to cross turfs to forge relationships with other gangs, and their members. As a result, the Spades became the biggest gang in the city in terms of both membership and turf.<ref name= chang />

After Bambaataa won an essay contest that earned him a trip to Africa, his worldview shifted.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve|last=Knopper|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-05-05/entertainment/ct-ott-0506-afrika-bambaataa-20110505_1_afrika-bambaataa-hip-hop-perfect-beat|title=Afrika Bambaataa: Crate-digger, collector, creator|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=May 5, 2011|access-date=October 23, 2014}}</ref> He had seen the movie ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' and was impressed with the solidarity exhibited by the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] in that film. During his trip to [[Africa]], the communities he visited inspired him to create one in his own neighborhood.<ref name=chang /> He changed his name to Afrika Bambaataa Aasim, adopting the name of the Zulu chief [[Bhambatha]], who led an armed rebellion against unfair economic practices in early 20th-century South Africa. He told people that his name was Zulu for "affectionate leader".<ref name= chang /> Bambaataa formed The "Bronx River Organization" as an alternative to the Black Spades.<ref name= chang />

==Career==
Due to the oft nebulous timeline of hip-hop origins, there are conflicting accounts of when Bambaataa began hosting parties. Some suggest he began as early as 1970, predating noted "father of hip hop" [[DJ_Kool_Herc|Kool Herc]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Mark|title=Groove Music: The Art and Culture of the Hip-Hop DJ|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-19-533112-7|location=New York, NY}}</ref> while others contend he began after Herc in 1976, in fact, attending and drawing inspiration from Kool Herc parties.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brewster|first=Bill|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43445660|title=Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey|date=2000|publisher=Grove Press|others=Frank Broughton|isbn=0-8021-3688-5|edition=1st American|location=New York|oclc=43445660}}</ref> He vowed to use hip-hop to draw angry kids out of gangs and form the [[Universal Zulu Nation]].<ref name="efioee">{{cite magazine|first=Jeff|last=Chang|title=It's a Hip-Hop World|magazine=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]|date=October 12, 2009|pages=58–65}}</ref>

[[Keef Cowboy|Robert Keith Wiggins]], a.k.a. "Cowboy" of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]], is credited with naming hip-hop. The term became a common phrase used by MCs as part of a [[scat singing|scat]]-inspired style of rhyming.<ref name="Total Chaos">{{cite book|first=Jorge|last=Pabon|editor-first=Jeff|editor-last=Chang|title=Total Chaos: The Art and Aesthetics of Hip Hop|url=https://archive.org/details/totalchaosartaes00chan|url-access=registration|chapter=Physical Graffiti: the History of Hip Hop Dance|publisher=Civitas Books|location=New York City|date=2007|isbn=978-0-465-00909-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/totalchaosartaes00chan/page/19 19]}}</ref>The term was first used in print to refer to the music by reporter Robert Flipping, Jr. in a February 1979 article in the New Pittsburgh Courier,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Flipping |first=Robert Jr. |date=February 24, 1979 |title=If You Funk Us, We'll Funk You |work=New Pittsburgh Courier}}</ref> and to refer to the culture in a January 1982 interview of Afrika Bambaataa by [[Michael Holman (filmmaker)|Michael Holman]] in the East Village Eye.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Holman |first=Michael |date=January 1982 |title=An interview with DJ Africa Bambaata of the Zulu Nation |pages=22 |work=East Village Eye}}</ref> The term gained further currency in September of that year in another Bambaataa interview in The Village Voice,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hager |first=Steven |date=September 21, 1982 |title=Afrika Bambaataa's Hip Hop |pages=69 |work=The Village Voice}}</ref> by [[Steven Hager]].

In 1982, Bambaataa and his followers – a group of dancers, artists, and [[Disc jockey|DJs]] – went outside the United States on the first hip-hop tour.<ref name= chang /> He saw that the hip hop tours would be the key to help expand hip hop and his Universal Zulu Nation. In addition it would help promote the values of hip hop that he believed are based on peace, unity, love, and having fun. He brought peace to the gangs; many artists and gang members say that "hip hop saved a lot of lives".<ref name="efioee" /> His influence inspired many overseas artists like the [[French hip hop|French rapper]] [[MC Solaar]].<ref name="efioee" />

He was a popular DJ in The South Bronx rap scene and became known not only as Afrika Bambaataa but also as the "Master of Records".<ref name="Hip Hop America">{{cite book|first=Nelson|last=George|title=Hip Hop America|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=New York City|date=2005|asin=B001R9DHYE|pages=16, 18, 57}}</ref> He established two rap crews: the [[Jazzy 5]] including MCs Master Ice, Mr. Freeze, Master Bee, Master D.E.E, and AJ Les, and the second crew referred to as [[Soulsonic Force]] including Mr. Biggs, Pow Wow and Emcee G.L.O.B.E.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Eriq|last=Gardner|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/africa-bambaataa-soulsonic-force-seek-864655|title=Africa Bambaataa and Soulsonic Force Seek to Reclaim 'Planet Rock' from Record Label|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=February 12, 2016|access-date=December 14, 2018}}</ref>

In 1982, Bambaataa, who was inspired by [[Kraftwerk]]'s futuristic electronic music, debuted at [[Roxy NYC|The Roxy]] a test cassette of [[EBN-OZN]]'s ground breaking, 12-inch white rap/spoken word "AEIOU Sometimes Y". It was the first commercially released American single ever made on a computer, a [[Fairlight CMI]], ushering in the era of music computer sampling.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Robert|last=Fink|title=The Story of ORCH5, or, the Classical Ghost in the Hip-Hop Machine|journal=Popular Music|volume=24|issue=3|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England|date=October 2005|pages=339–356|doi=10.1017/S0261143005000553|s2cid=162937679}}</ref> In that same year, Bambaataa and Soulsonic Force stopped performing with a live band, and began to use only technology. Bambaataa credited the pioneering Japanese [[electropop]] group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], whose work he sampled, as an inspiration.<ref name="guardian_ymo">{{cite news|first=John|last=Lewis|title=Back to the future: Yellow Magic Orchestra helped usher in electronica – and they may just have invented hip-hop, too|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/04/electronicmusic.filmandmusic11|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London, England|date=July 4, 2008|access-date=May 25, 2011}}</ref><ref name="wire_1996">{{cite magazine|title=The Wire, Volumes 143-148 |magazine=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|date=1996|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qtw4AQAAIAAJ |access-date=May 25, 2011}}</ref>

He also borrowed a keyboard hook from German [[Electronic music|electronic]] pioneers [[Kraftwerk]] and was provided the electronic [[Roland TR-808]] "beat-box" by producer [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] and synthesizer player [[John Robie]]. That resulted in "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]", which went to gold status and generated an entire school of "electro-boogie" rap and dance music. Bambaataa formed his own label to release the Time Zone Compilation. He created "[[turntablism]]" as its own subgenre and the ratification of "[[electronica]]" as an industry-certified trend in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eve|last=Hyman|url=https://www.metro.us/entertainment/afrika-bambaataa-is-hip-hop/tmWmdC---c5ZGPvnEwKZpA|title=Afrika Bambaataa is hip-hop|website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|location=London, England|date=April 29, 2013|access-date=December 14, 2018}}</ref>

===Birth of the Zulu Nation===
In the late 1970s, Bambaataa formed what became known as the Universal Zulu Nation, a group of socially and politically aware rappers, [[B-boy]]s, [[graffiti]] artists and other people involved in [[hip hop culture]].<ref name="Hip Hop America" /> By 1977, inspired by DJ Kool Herc and [[DJ Dee]], and after [[Disco King Mario]] loaned him his first equipment, Bambaataa began organizing [[block party|block parties]] all around The South Bronx. He even faced his long-time friend, Disco King Mario in a DJ battle. He then began performing at [[Adlai E. Stevenson High School (New York City)|Adlai E. Stevenson High School]] and formed the Bronx River Organization, then later simply "The Organization".<ref name= hood/>

Bambaataa had deejayed with his own sound system at [[Bronx River Houses|The Bronx River Houses]]' Community Center, with Mr. Biggs, Queen Kenya, and Cowboy, who accompanied him in performances in the community. Because of his prior status in the Black Spades, he already had an established Army party crowd drawn from former members of the gang. Hip hop culture was spreading through the streets via house parties, block parties, gym dances and mix tapes.<ref name= hood>{{cite book|first=Murray|last=Forman|title=The Hood Comes First: Race, Space, and Place in Rap and Hip Hop|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Connecticut|date=2002|isbn=978-0-8195-6397-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/hoodcomesfirstra00form/page/69 69]|url=https://archive.org/details/hoodcomesfirstra00form/page/69}}</ref>

About a year later Bambaataa reformed the group, calling it the Zulu Nation (inspired by his wide studies on African history at the time). Specifically, Bambaataa watched the 1964 film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'', which sparked the name for the group. Five b-boys ([[Breakdance|break dancers]]) joined him, whom he called the Zulu Kings, and later formed the Zulu Queens, and the Shaka Zulu Kings and Queens. As he continued deejaying, more DJs, rappers, [[b-boy]]s, [[b-girl]]s, graffiti writers, and artists followed him, and he took them under his wing and made them all members of his Zulu Nation.

He was also the founder of the [[Soulsonic Force]], which originally consisted of approximately 20 Zulu Nation members: Mr. Biggs, Queen Kenya, DJ Cowboy Soulsonic Force (#2), Pow Wow, G.L.0.B.E. (creator of the "MC popping" rap style), [[DJ Jazzy Jay]], Cosmic Force, Queen Lisa Lee, Prince Ikey C, Ice Ice (#1), Chubby Chub; [[Jazzy Five]]-DJ Jazzy Jay, Mr. Freeze, Master D.E.E., Kool DJ Red Alert, Sundance, Ice Ice (#2), Charlie Choo, Master Bee, Busy Bee Starski, Akbar (Lil Starski), and [[Raheim]]. The personnel for the Soulsonic Force were groups within groups with whom he would perform and make records.

In 1980, Bambaataa's groups made ''Death Mix'', their first recording with [[Paul Winley Records]]. According to Bambaata, this was an unauthorized release.<ref name= chang /> Winley recorded two versions of Soulsonic Force's landmark single, "Zulu Nation Throwdown", with authorization from the musicians. Disappointed with the results of the single, Bambaataa left the company. The arranger credit on these recordings is correctly attributed to Harlem Underground Band leader, Kevin Donovan. This led to the false assumption that Bambaataa's real name was Kevin Donovan, which was widely accepted by the hip hop community until recently, following sexual abuse allegations, when Bronx River residents spoke out and revealed in oral testimonies that Bambaataa's real name was in fact Lance Taylor.<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l61DwN_BB1Q|title=Video|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422024303/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l61DwN_BB1Q|archive-date=April 22, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Zulu Nation was the first hip-hop organization, with an official birth date of November 12, 1977. Bambaataa's plan with the Universal Zulu Nation was to build a movement out of the creativity of a new generation of outcast youths with an authentic, liberating worldview.<ref name= chang />

===Recognition===
[[File:Afrika Bambaataa and DJ Yutaka (2004).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Afrika Bambaataa (left) in 2004]]
In 1981, hip hop artist [[Fab Five Freddy]] was putting together music packages in the largely white downtown [[Manhattan]] [[New wave music|new wave]] clubs, and invited Bambaataa to perform at one of them, the [[Mudd Club]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Hager|author-link=Steven Hager|title=Afrika Bambaataa's Hip-Hop|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York City|date=September 21, 1982}}</ref> It was the first time Bambaataa had performed before a predominantly white crowd. Attendance for his parties downtown became so large that he had to move to larger venues, first to the Ritz, in a show organized by hip hop pioneer, Michael Holman, with [[Malcolm McLaren]]'s group [[Bow Wow Wow]], then to the [[Peppermint Lounge]], The Jefferson, Negril, [[Danceteria]] and the [[Roxy NYC|Roxy]].<ref name="efioee" />

"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]", a popular single produced by [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] and the keyboardist [[John Robie]], came out that June under the name Afrika Bambaataa and the [[Soulsonic Force]]. The song borrowed musical motifs from German [[electronic music]], funk, and rock. Different elements and musical styles were used together. The song became an immediate hit and stormed the music charts worldwide.<ref name="efioee" /> The song melded the main melody from Kraftwerk's "[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]" with electronic beats based on their track "[[Numbers (Kraftwerk song)|Numbers]]" as well as portions from records by [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Captain Sky]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaldarkness.com/articles/beatbox_bites_back.htm|title=The Beat Box Bites Back|magazine=Face Magazine|date=1984|publisher=Global Darkness|access-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref> thus creating a new style of music altogether, [[Electro music|electro funk]].

Afrika Bambaataa was booked on the first ever European hip hop tour presented by Europe One and Fnac France.<ref>{{cite web |first=Karim|last=Orange|title=Hip-Hop Dance History: 10 Reasons You Should Check Out the Rock Steady Crew|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karim-orange/hiphop-dance-history-10-r_b_3552923.html|website=[[Huffington Post]]|location=New York City|date=July 8, 2013|access-date=July 9, 2013|quote=In 1982, their manager Ruza "Kool Lady" Blue organized The Roxy Tour, which featured Grandmixer D.S.T now Rock Steady Crew, Afrika Bambaataa, [[Cold Crush Brothers]], Double-Dutch Girls, and Fab 5 Freddy.

Bambaataa's second release around 1983 was "[[Looking for the Perfect Beat]]", then later, "[[Renegades of Funk]]", both with the same Soulsonic Force. He began working with producer [[Bill Laswell]] at Jean Karakos's [[Celluloid Records]], where he developed and placed two groups on the label: Time Zone and Shango. Bambaataa recorded "Wildstyle" with [[Time Zone (band)|Time Zone]], and he recorded a collaboration with [[punk rock]]er [[John Lydon]] and Time Zone in 1984, titled "World Destruction". Shango's album, ''Shango Funk Theology'', was released by the label in 1984.<ref name="Star Time: Song by Song">{{cite AV media notes|title=Star Time: Song by Song|others=James Brown, Afrika Bambaataa|date=1991|first1=Alan|last1=Leeds|first2=Harry|last2=Weinger |pages=46–53|type=CD booklet|publisher=PolyGram Records|location=New York City}}</ref>

In 1984, Bambaataa and other hip hop celebrities appeared in the movie ''[[Beat Street]]''. He also made a landmark recording with [[James Brown]], titled "[[Unity (Afrika Bambaataa and James Brown song)|Unity]]". It was billed in music industry circles as "the Godfather of Soul meets the Godfather of Hip Hop".<ref name="Star Time: Song by Song"/>

Around October 1985, Bambaataa and other music stars worked on the anti-[[apartheid]] album ''[[Sun City (album)|Sun City]]'' with [[Little Steven Van Zandt]], [[Joey Ramone]], [[Run–D.M.C.]], [[Lou Reed]], [[U2]], and others. During 1988, he recorded "Afrika Bambaataa and Family" for [[Capitol Records]], titled The Light, featuring [[Nona Hendryx]], [[UB40]], [[Boy George]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and [[Yellowman]]. He had recorded a few other works with Family three years earlier, one titled "Funk You" in 1985, and the other titled "Beware (The Funk Is Everywhere)" in 1986. In 1986 he discovered an artist in [[Atlanta]]. (Through MC SHY D) by the name of Kenya Miler a.k.a. MC Harmony (Known producer now as Kenya Fame Flames Miller), that was later signed to Criminal Records and Arthur Baker.<ref name= hood />

The group was Harmony and LG. The first single, 1987's "Dance To The Drums/No Joke", was produced by Bambaataa and Baker with musicians Keith LeBlanc and Doug Wimbish. Bambaataa was involved in the Stop the Violence Movement, and with other hip hop artists recorded "Self Destruction", a 12" single which hit number one on the Hot Rap Singles Chart in March 1989. The single went gold and raised $400,000 for the National Urban League to be used for community anti-violence education programs.<ref name= hood />

In 1990, Bambaataa made ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's "Most Important Americans of the 20th Century" issue. He was also involved in the anti-apartheid work "Hip Hop Artists Against Apartheid" for Warlock Records. He teamed with the [[Jungle Brothers]] to record the album ''Return to Planet Rock (The Second Coming)''.

Gee Street Records, Bambaataa and John Baker organized a concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[London]] in 1990 for the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), in honor of [[Nelson Mandela]]'s release from prison. The concert brought together performances by British and American rappers, and also introduced both Nelson and [[Winnie Mandela]] and the ANC to hip hop audiences. In relation to the event, the recording Ndodemnyama (Free South Africa) helped raise approximately $30,000 for the ANC.<ref>{{cite web|first=Davey 'D.'|last=Cook |url=http://www.daveyd.com/baminterview.html|title=On The Line With....Africa Bambaataa|date=December 1991|access-date=October 23, 2014|website=daveyd.com|publisher=KMEL Beat Report}}</ref>

From the mid-1990s, Bambaataa returned to his electro roots. In 1998, he produced a remix of "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" combining electro and [[house music]] elements, called "Planet Rock '98", which is regarded as an early example of the [[electro house]] genre.<ref name="Eurodance Hits Polystar Electro House">{{cite web|title=Electro House|url=http://www.eurodancehits.com/music/electrohouse.htm |publisher=Polystar|website=EurodanceHits.com|access-date=June 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206043102/http://www.eurodancehits.com/music/electrohouse.htm|archive-date=December 6, 1998}}</ref> In 2000, [[Rage Against the Machine]] covered his song "[[Renegades of Funk]]" for their album, ''[[Renegades (Rage Against the Machine album)|Renegades]]''.

I look to KRS-One for that." He has also said that he looked to Eminem for multi-syllabic rhythmic patters and "inners," which are rhymes in the beginning or middle of a line. Although KRS-One and Eminem have influenced him, he's also named Mos Def and Andre 3000 as well, with his biggest influence being Cee-Lo Green of Goodie Mob and Gnarls Barkley. "Cee-lo use of melody, song-writing ability, and just the strength and feeling of the words he chooses is pretty invaluable," says the Bronx native.

YC the Cynic has been lauded by some of the most notable names in the hip hop industry.  In his "DXNext" feature, the writer described him as being "a standout in the cutthroat New York City underground scene."<ref>{{Cite web

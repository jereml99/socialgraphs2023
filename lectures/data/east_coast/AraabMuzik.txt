==Biography==

===1989-2005: Early life and career beginnings===
Araabmuzik was born and raised in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], into a musical household. His mother was a professional singer. He is the middle child of three and is of Dominican and Guatemalan ancestry. Abraham has said he learned to play the drums at age three and later began playing the keyboard.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://iloveneon.ca/araabmuzik-at-le-belmont-on-february-12-2016/|title=Araabmuzik at Le Belmont on February 12, 2016|website=iloveneon.ca|access-date=November 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111124125/http://iloveneon.ca/araabmuzik-at-le-belmont-on-february-12-2016/|archive-date=November 11, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Despite not being well known for it, Abraham found a lot of hip hop inspiration in his native home town of Providence. "There's definitely a lot of Hip-Hop here. You'll find a lot of local rap groups, solo artists out here that are trying make it, it's just the fact that we're not on the map like that just yet."<ref name=":5" />

Having a musical background lead to Araabmuzik to begin producing hip hop, and had begun getting traction in the industry at a very early age. Having a natural inkling towards the MPC, he went on to buy his first unit in 2005. By 2006, at age 17, he had begun being noticed by [[Diplomat Records]].<ref name=":4" />

==Career==

=== 2006–2010: Diplomats ===
After meeting with record producer and [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] of [[Diplomat Records]], [[DukeDaGod]] in 2006, he became affiliated with the [[The Diplomats|Dipset]] label. He began making beats for Diplomat artists such as [[Hell Rell]] and [[Cam'ron]].<ref name=":4">{{cite web| url= http://wecreatemusic.ascap.com/wecreatemusic/post/2011/02/14/Salute-Behind-the-Beats-with-AraabMuzik.aspx| title= Salute: Behind the Beats with AraabMuzik| publisher= Wecreatemusic.ascap.com| access-date= August 27, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220915/http://wecreatemusic.ascap.com/wecreatemusic/post/2011/02/14/Salute-Behind-the-Beats-with-AraabMuzik.aspx| archive-date= July 25, 2011| url-status= dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akaipro.com/araabmuzik |title=araabMUZIK |publisher=Akaipro.com |date=February 13, 2011 |access-date=August 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721032019/http://www.akaipro.com/araabmuzik |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2009, AraabMuzik was featured as a main producer on rapper Cam'ron's album ''[[Crime Pays (Cam'ron album)|Crime Pays]]'', producing the single "Get It in Ohio".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Camron-Crime-Pays/release/1830802|title=Cam'ron - Crime Pays|website=Discogs|date=May 8, 2009 |access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref> From 2009 to 2010, he contributed many instrumentals to a series of mixtapes called ''Boss of All Bosses'' by Cam'ron and upcoming rapper [[Vado (rapper)|Vado]].

=== 2010–2015: ''Trance Party'' & ''Electronic Dream'' ===
In 2010, The Diplomats released Dipset Trance Party,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/Your-boy-SK-Dipset-Trance-Party-mixtape.177770.html|title=Various Artists - Dipset Trance Party Hosted by Your boy SK|website=DatPiff|access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref> an instrumental mixtape featuring artists (including AraabMuzik) employing a style that melded trance music with hip hop influences. This would prove to become a large influence on AraabMuzik's future sound. His track "South Beach" sampled [[Alice Deejay]]'s "[[Better Off Alone (Alice Deejay song)|Better Off Alone]]", which AraabMuzik has said sparked his signature samples of electronic music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/8770-araabmuzik/|title=AraabMuzik {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|date=February 6, 2012 |access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

The first popularization of his new sound appeared in the comeback single "Salute" of rap group [[The Diplomats]], also in 2010. In an interview with NPR he called "Salute" a different sound "that pretty much got me into the EDM".<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/microphonecheck/2015/01/20/377033509/araabmuzik-i-have-so-much-music-it-doesnt-make-sense|title=AraabMuzik: 'I Have So Much Music, It Doesn't Make Sense'|last=Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Frannie Kelley|date=January 20, 2015|work=Microphone Check|publisher=NPR}}</ref>

AraabMuzik released his breakout independent project [[Electronic Dream]] in 2011, which brought this signature sound of his production to the forefront. It was met with largely positive reviews<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/8727-the-top-50-albums-of-2011/?page=2|title=The Top 50 Albums of 2011 - Page 2 {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Electronic Dream by AraabMuzik|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/electronic-dream/araabmuzik|access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref> and garnered him a large enough audience to begin touring internationally,<ref name=":0" /> getting booked for various clubs and shows to perform his music using the drum machine as an instrument.<ref name=":5" />

Along with additional releases, Abraham also steadily gained more popularity from videos on [[YouTube]] of him using the MPC to make live beats and drum patterns. He was also featured on the [[Akai|Akai Pro]] website as an official Akai Pro artist, alongside other MPC users such as [[The Alchemist (producer)|Alchemist]] and DiViNCi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akaipro.com/artistsfull|title=Akai Pro Artists|publisher=Akaipro.com|access-date=August 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721032028/http://www.akaipro.com/artistsfull|archive-date=July 21, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== 2016: ''Dream World'' ===
To complement ''Electronic Dream's'' sound and success, AraabMuzik began working on a full length official album ''Dream World'', slated for a 2015 release. However, it ended up being delayed numerous times; he was quoted saying "I pushed it back so I could still really perfect it and work on it more, because I didn't really feel like I was satisfied with it."<ref name=":6" />

''Dream World'' was released in July 2016, to generally favorable reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=Dream World by AraabMuzik|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/dream-world/araabmuzik|access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref> Although initially meant to sound like ''Electronic Dream'', AraabMuzik decided to venture into a more eclectic album, catering to fans of different genres, both Electronic and Hip Hop, as well as experimental beats such as "War Cry".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.papermag.com/aarabmuzik-1906694828.html|title=AraabMuzik Talks Musical Manipulation, Improvisation and Bouncing Back With "Dream World"|last=Magazine|first=Paper|date=July 6, 2016|newspaper=PAPERMAG|access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Artistry==

=== Artist name ===
Abraham's artist name was given to him by a friend when he began producing - initially Young Arab, "I pretty much just ran with it, added an extra 'a' to it, and then later down the line I added 'muzik."<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-araab-muzik-ott-0108-20160104-story.html|title=Araabmuzik says that there isn't much in a name, really|last=Stewart|first=Allison|newspaper=chicagotribune.com|access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref> Although the name has caused confusions about his origins, he became very famous very quickly, resulting in it being too late to change it. "It's something I'm stuck with, like you have your first phone number and you never changed it throughout the years, you just kept it."

=== Influences ===
Abraham has cited [[Swizz Beatz]] as a major influence, and the two have said to have a brotherly relationship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2016/02/26/producer-araabmuzik-shot-in-harlem/|title=Producer AraabMuzik Shot in Harlem|website=Rap-Up|access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref> He's gone on to say, "He had his own distinguished sound. He was always using the keyboards and playing his own stuff. Nothing was sounding like anything he was doing."<ref name=":0" /> Other influences include [[Dr. Dre]], [[DJ Premier|Premier]], [[J Dilla]], [[9th Wonder]], and [[The Alchemist (musician)|Alchemist]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Production style ===
AraabMuzik's style often employs samples arranged and triggered in real time on the MPC drum machine, with fast-paced drum patterns involving rapid [[hi-hat]]s and [[Kickdrums|kick drums]]. He has used [[Sampling (music)|samples]] from a variety of music, including electro, [[dubstep]], [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]], [[gabber]], and [[trance music]]. Although his main tool is still an [[Akai]] Music Production Center (MPC) drum machine, he has also used keyboard controllers and occasionally live drums.

In 2020 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] he decided to spend time sharpening his skills on the [[Akai]] Music Production Center (MPC) drum machine. 

He has worked with several artists including [[ASAP Rocky]] and [[ASAP Mob]], [[Cam'ron]], [[Azealia Banks]], [[Vado (rapper)|Vado]], [[The Diplomats]], [[Hell Rell]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[50 Cent]], ArJaye the King, [[Eminem]], and [[Slaughterhouse (hip hop group)|Slaughterhouse]] among others.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_MS15102 |title=AraabMUZIK |publisher=Schedule.sxsw.com |access-date=August 27, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721194950/http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_MS15102| archive-date= July 21, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

=== Creative process ===
In an interview Araabmuzik revealed that he made all of his music while sober.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2699145/araabmuzik-on-being-shot-and-why-he-records-sober/|title=Araabmuzik on Being Shot and Why He Records Sober|last=Sowmya Krishnamurthy|date=July 16, 2013|work=MTV Hive}}</ref> Araabmuzik has sampled 187 songs from other artists, including [[The Who]]'s "Won't Get Fooled Again" which he restyled as "Outer Limits."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/search/connections/?q=araabmuzik|title=WhoSampled|website=[[WhoSampled]] |access-date=September 12, 2021}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
In November 2012, trance producer Adam K accused Araabmuzik of plagiarism for the records that he had sampled on ''Electronic Dream'' without giving proper credit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2012/11/27/trance-producer-adam-k-calls-out-fraud-araabmuzik-for-plagiarism/|title=Trance producer Adam K calls out "fraud" AraabMuzik for plagiarism|website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|date=November 27, 2012 |access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref>

In early May 2013, AraabMuzik was shot in an attempted [[robbery]]. He was walking around his neighborhood in the company of his friends when several men attempted to take his money. He resisted and was shot in the process.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/araabmuzik-recovering-after-he-was-shot-during-attempted-robbery-20130503|title=AraabMuzik Shot, Recovering After Attempted Robbery|last=Cubarrubia|first=RJ|date=May 3, 2013|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=February 10, 2015}}</ref>

In October 2015, a track was supposedly leaked from the unreleased ''Dream World'' album featuring R&B artist [[Kelela]], named "Final Hour", much to Kelela's disappointment and frustrations which she expressed on Twitter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/61788-kelela-and-araabmuzik-accuse-ar-guy-of-leaking-their-music/|title=Kelela and AraabMuzik Accuse A&R Guy of Leaking Their Music {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|date=October 25, 2015 |access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref> Araabmuzik's management released an official PR release claiming no responsibility for the leak.

In February 2016, AraabMuzik was shot again as a victim of an attempted robbery in [[Harlem]]. He had gunshot wounds to his jaw and arm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papermag.com/aarabmuzik-1906694828.html|title=AraabMuzik Talks Musical Manipulation, Improvisation and Bouncing Back With "Dream World"|publisher=papermag.com|access-date=July 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/producer-araabmuzik-pal-shot-harlem-article-1.2544784|title=EXCLUSIVE: Producer AraabMuzik and pal shot in Harlem|date=February 26, 2016 |publisher=nydailynews.com|access-date=July 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/02/araabmuzik-producer-shot-harlem-parking-garage-surgery-gunshot-recovery/|title=Hip-Hop Producer AraabMuzik Shot and Wounded in Harlem Robbery Attempt - SPIN|date=February 26, 2016|publisher=spin.com blog|access-date=July 11, 2016}}</ref>

Abraham has spoken very little about these incidents having said "There's really not much to speak on [with] something like that" in an interview with Noisey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/araabmuzik-interview-profile-2016|title=Araabmuzik's Dream World Is Your Reality - Noisey|website=Noisey|date=July 15, 2016 |language=en-us|access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

'''Mach-Hommy''' is a [[Haiti]]an-[[United States|American]] rapper and record producer. He is well-known for his reclusive nature, concealing his real name and face in all public appearances.<ref name="GQ">{{Cite web|first=Paul|last=Thompson|title=Mach-Hommy: The Man Behind the Mask|url=https://www.gq.com/story/mach-hommy-balens-cho-interview|publisher=[[GQ]]|date=December 9, 2021|access-date=March 21, 2022}}</ref> This behavior has led him to be described as "one of hip-hop's most elusive artists".<ref name="Pitchfork">{{Cite web|first=Dylan|last=Green|title=Mach-Hommy on Knowing His Own Worth and Paying It Forward|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/mach-hommy-interview-pray-for-haiti-legacy/|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|date=January 28, 2022|access-date=March 21, 2022}}</ref>

Mach-Hommy has gained a [[cult following]] as a result of his work ethic and elusiveness. His lyrics are often heavily related to the social and political history of his Haitian heritage. Though he predominantly raps in English, he also frequently incorporates [[Haitian Creole|Haitian Kreyòl]] into his lyrics. He forbids lyric sites to post transcriptions of the words to his songs,<ref>{{Cite web|first=Andre |last=Gee |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/mach-hommy-interview-new-album-1234609069/ |title=Don't Call Mach-Hommy 'Reclusive' |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 13, 2022 |access-date=August 18, 2023}}</ref> and he charges hundreds and even thousands of dollars for his releases, most of which are not available on [[streaming services]].

==Early life==
Mach-Hommy was raised predominantly in [[Newark, New Jersey]], but also spent much of his childhood in [[Port-au-Prince]]. His father was a folk guitarist, and Mach credits his father's musical style as an influence on his own.<ref name="GQ" /> The first music Mach recorded was at the age of 13, when he performed a [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] over the beat to [[Raekwon]]'s "Verbal Intercourse".<ref name="fader-part1" />

In his early career, Mach found the music recording process to be an "unhealthy" environment and sought to take up filmmaking instead. However, at the encouragement of [[Westside Gunn]], he returned to rapping in the early 2010s.<ref name="fader-part2">{{Cite web|first=Paul |last=Thompson |title=The Making of Mach-Hommy, Part 2: Beloved |url=https://www.thefader.com/2023/03/01/mach-hommy-interview-cover-story-part-2-beloved-2023 |publisher=[[The Fader]] |date=March 1, 2023 |access-date=March 1, 2023}}</ref>

==Career==
Mach-Hommy first received widespread attention after the release of his 2016 album, ''H.B.O. (Haitian Body Odor)'', which he sold via [[Instagram]].<ref name="GQ" /><ref name="Pitchfork" /> Mach pressed only 187 copies of the ''H.B.O.'' CD and sold them for $300 apiece, before eventually uploading the album to [[SoundCloud]] in 2017.<ref name="DJBooth">{{Cite web|first=Andy|last=James|title=Meet Mach-Hommy, Earl Sweatshirt's New Favorite Rapper|url=https://djbooth.net/features/2017-03-10-mach-hommy-hbo|publisher=DJBooth|date=March 10, 2017|access-date=March 21, 2022}}</ref> He released numerous other albums in the following years, many of which were sold at high prices through services like [[Bandcamp]] and never released on streaming services.<ref name="GQ" /><ref name="Pitchfork" />

In 2021, Mach-Hommy released his album ''[[Pray for Haiti]]'' on most streaming services. Mach stated that he would donate his share of profits from the album to the Pray for Haiti Trust Fund, a charity he established to fund educational services and institutions in Haiti.<ref name="GQ" /><ref name="Pitchfork" /> ''Pray for Haiti'' also brought Mach a greater level of attention from the music press, with ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' honoring the album with a "Best New Music" award and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' describing it as "a modern hip-hop classic".<ref name="PrayForHaiti-PF">{{Cite web|first=Paul A.|last=Thompson|title=Mach-Hommy: Pray for Haiti Album Review|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mach-hommy-pray-for-haiti/|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|date=May 27, 2021|access-date=March 21, 2022}}</ref><ref name="PrayForHaiti-RS">{{Cite web|first=Jayson|last=Buford|title=How Mach-Hommy and Westside Gunn Made 'Pray for Haiti' a Modern Hip-Hop Classic|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/mach-hommy-westside-gunn-interview-pray-for-haiti-1187804/|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 22, 2021|access-date=March 21, 2022}}</ref>

Mach-Hommy has intermittently associated with the [[Griselda Records]] label. Though Mach was once considered part of the Griselda collective, he separated from them after a falling-out with [[Westside Gunn]], and as of 2017 Mach-Hommy was unaffiliated with the label.<ref name="DJBooth" /><ref name="PrayForHaiti-PF" /> Mach and Gunn eventually reconciled in late 2020, as Westside Gunn served as an executive producer of ''Pray for Haiti''.<ref name="PrayForHaiti-PF" />

==Personal life==
In an interview with [[Billboard.com]], Mach stated that he was fluent in the majority of the [[Romance languages]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/mach-hommy-interview-dj-muggs-8492427/|title=Mach-Hommy on His Approach to Collaborations, Staying True to Artistic Principles & Upcoming Album With DJ Muggs|first=Sweeney|last=Kovar|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=March 15, 2019}}</ref>

==Influences==
Mach-Hommy cites a wide range of writers as influential upon him, including [[William Shakespeare]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[George Orwell]], [[Lorraine Hansberry]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], and [[Dante]]. He also cites political and philosophical thinkers such as [[Malcolm X]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref name="fader-part1">{{Cite web|first=Paul |last=Thompson |title=The Making of Mach-Hommy, Part 1: Designated Unicorn |url=https://www.thefader.com/2023/02/28/mach-hommy-interview-cover-story-part-1-designated-unicorn-2023 |publisher=[[The Fader]] |date=February 28, 2023 |access-date=February 28, 2023}}</ref>

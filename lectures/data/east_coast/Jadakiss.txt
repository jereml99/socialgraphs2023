He began his career in the 1990s as a member of the rap trio [[The Lox]], managed by [[Ruff Ryders]] and signed with [[Bad Boy Entertainment|Bad Boy]]. After leaving the label in 1999, they signed a joint venture deal between [[Interscope Records]] and Ruff Ryders. He is currently signed to [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]], [[Roc Nation]], and D-Block.

Jadakiss' debut solo album, ''[[Kiss Tha Game Goodbye]]'', was released in 2001. He has released three more solo studio albums, another album with the Lox, and an album with fellow rapper [[Fabolous]]. In 2007, Jadakiss signed with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc-A-Fella]] and [[Def Jam]], which, with [[Ruff Ryders]], co-released his 2009 album ''[[The Last Kiss (album)|The Last Kiss]]''. Altogether, he has released five studio albums, most recently ''[[Ignatius (album)|Ignatius]]'' in 2020.

== Early life ==

Jason Terrance Phillips was born on May 27, 1975, in [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and had an interest in hip hop from an early age. At age 12, he began hustling after his parents asked him to earn his own money. He began [[freestyle rap]]ping for money after watching other people do it on the street corner. While freestyling, he eventually met longtime friends [[Sheek Louch]] and [[Styles P]].

==Career==
Phillips quickly developed a small underground fanbase and at the age of 12, entered himself into a freestyle competition in Florida where he attracted the attention of the owners of [[Ruff Ryders]]. Along with Styles and Louch, he formed a group known as '''The Warlox''', and the trio began rapping together. They eventually met [[Mary J. Blige]], who, impressed with their lyrics, handed their demo to [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]], who signed the group to his label [[Bad Boy Entertainment|Bad Boy]].<ref name="hiphopscriptures.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.hiphopscriptures.com/jadakiss/ |title= Jadakiss Biography|website=Hip Hop Scriptures|access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref>

===1994–2000: The Lox===
Upon signing with Bad Boy, Puff Daddy shortened the group's name from The Warloxs to simply The Lox. They made their first appearance on [[Main Source]]'s 1994 LP ''[[Fuck What You Think]]'' on the track "Set it Off."<ref name="hiphopscriptures.com"/> They immediately began writing and performing on hit songs with fellow Bad Boy artists, including Puff Daddy's "It's All About the Benjamins" and "I Got the Power", [[Mase|Mase's]] "24 Hrs. to Live", [[Mariah Carey|Mariah Carey's]] "Honey", [[Mary J. Blige|Mary J. Blige's]] "Can't Get You Off My Mind" and [[The Notorious B.I.G.|The Notorious B.I.G.'s]] "Last Day". The group developed a close relationship with B.I.G., during which time Jadakiss especially was taken under his wing. The Lox's first hit song was a tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. in the wake of his 1997 death, titled "We'll Always Love Big Poppa". The song was chosen as the [[B-side]] to [[Puff Daddy|Puff Daddy's]] smash hit B.I.G. tribute song "[[I'll Be Missing You]]", and received widespread commercial success, achieving [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] status from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The success and reception of the song opened the door for them to write more of their own songs, and in 1998, the Lox released their debut studio album, ''[[Money, Power & Respect]]''. The album was both a commercial and critical success, peaking at number 3 on the [[Billboard 200]]<ref name="billboard.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-lox/chart-history/tlp/|title=The Lox Chart History (Billboard 200)| work= billboard.com|access-date=April 4, 2018}}</ref> and number 1 on the US [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]]<ref name="billboard.com1">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-lox/chart-history/blp/| title= The Lox Chart History (R&B Hip-Hop Albums)|work= billboard.com |access-date=April 4, 2018}}</ref> chart, and went on to achieve platinum status. Though the record was successful, The Lox grew unhappy with [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]] and Puff Daddy's glossy, radio friendly production, feeling it conflicted with their grimier street aesthetic. Following the release of their debut album, the group left the label to sign with [[Ruff Ryders]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theo2.co.uk/events/detail/the-loxd-block-jadakiss-style-p-sheek-louch-trinity-tour|title=The Lox/D-Block Jadakiss, Styles P & Sheek Louch Trinity Tour |website= theo2.co.uk|access-date=April 4, 2018}}</ref> They released their second album, We Are The Streets, in 2000, through Ruff Ryders. The album was once again a success, peaking at number 5 on the Billboard 200 and number 2 on the US Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart.<ref name="billboard.com"/><ref name="billboard.com1"/> It featured production from [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Timbaland]], and spawned one single, "[[Ryde or Die, Bitch]]", featuring fellow Ruff Ryders artist [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]].

===2001–2007: Solo career===
[[File:Jadakiss 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Jadakiss in 2009]]
Jadakiss began embarking on a solo career in 2001 and his debut album, ''[[Kiss Tha Game Goodbye]]'', was released in August 2001 on the Ruff Ryders/[[Interscope Records|Interscope]] label. The album featured popular guests and producers such as [[DJ Premier]], [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], Eve, [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Nas]] and [[Swizz Beatz]] and was commercially successful, going on to be certified [[RIAA Certification|gold]] by the RIAA and selling over 200,000 copies during its first week of release. Despite commercial success, the album received negative reception from critics who criticised the album for being repetitive and uninspired.  Jadakiss has acknowledged the criticism as valid, saying the record was done less out of inspiration but rather out of contractual obligations to Bad Boy.<ref name="hiphopscriptures.com"/> The album produced three singles, "[[We Gonna Make It]]" featuring [[Styles P]], "[[Knock Yourself Out (Jadakiss song)|Knock Yourself Out]]" and "Put Ya Hands Up". Jadakiss followed this album with ''[[Kiss of Death (Jadakiss album)|Kiss of Death]]'', released in June 2004. It features guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, [[Eminem]], The Lox, [[Kanye West]], [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Nate Dogg]], [[DJ Quik]] and more. His song [[Why (Jadakiss song)|"Why?"]], featuring [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]] and produced by [[Havoc (rapper)|Havoc]] of [[Mobb Deep]], became one of the year's biggest hits, spawning a remix featuring Styles P, [[Common (rapper)|Common]] and [[Nas]]. "Why?" remains Jadakiss' biggest hit, peaking at #11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song also garnered controversy for a line in which Jadakiss claims that he believes [[George W. Bush]] planned the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]]. Another single from the record, "[[U Make Me Wanna (Jadakiss song)|U Make Me Wanna]]," featuring [[Mariah Carey]] peaked at number 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. The album was both a commercial and critical success, receiving better reviews than his previous album and debuted at number 1 on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums charts. In late 2007, Jadakiss signed to Jay-Z's [[Roc-A-Fella Records]], a move Jay had been trying to arrange for a long time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5891/title.jay-z-news-bits-jadakiss-40-40-american-gangster|title=Jay-Z News Bits (Jadakiss, 40/40 & American Gangster)| website= hiphopdx.com|date=October 29, 2007 |access-date=April 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5969/title.jadakiss-signs-with-roc-a-fella-records | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071117131456/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5969/title.jadakiss-signs-with-roc-a-fella-records| archive-date= November 17, 2007| date= November 15, 2007 |title=Jadakiss Signs With Roc-A-Fella Records |first= Jake |last= Paine | website= hiphopdx.com|access-date= April 27, 2020}}</ref> The move came on the heels of increased D-Block/Roc-a-Fella collaborations; in 2006, Jadakiss and former rival [[Beanie Sigel]] collaborated on [[DJ Khaled]]'s album ''[[Listennn... the Album]]'', and in 2007, on [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]]'s album ''[[Free at Last (Freeway album)|Free At Last]]''. Styles P appeared on a radio freestyle with Freeway and [[Beanie Sigel|Sigel]], and also appeared briefly in the video for Jay-Z's ''[[American Gangster (album)|American Gangster]]'' single "[[Roc Boys]]," in which he throws up the famous Roc-a-Fella sign, "the Diamond."

=== 2009–2015: ''The Last Kiss'' and ''Top 5 Dead or Alive'' ===

In 2009, Jadakiss released his much-delayed and anticipated third studio album, ''[[The Last Kiss (album)|The Last Kiss]]''. The first single, "[[By My Side (Jadakiss song)|By My Side]]" featuring [[Ne-Yo]] was released in October 2008. Two more singles, "Can't Stop Me" and "Death Wish" featuring Lil Wayne, were released in 2009. One more single, "Who's Real", featuring [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[OJ Da Juiceman]] released later that year. In 2010, Jadakiss left Roc-A-Fella records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hhvibe.wordpress.com/2009/11/26/jadakiss-leaves-roc-a-fella-records-reunites-with-ruff-ryders/|title=Jadakiss leaves Roc-A-Fella Records, reunites with Ruff Ryders|date=November 26, 2009|access-date=April 4, 2018}}</ref> In 2011, he was featured on two DJ Khaled tracks, one of them titled "It Ain't Over Til It's Over", featuring [[Mary J.

On April 26, 2012, Jadakiss released his mixtape ''Consignment'', hosted by [[DJ Drama]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/Jadakiss-Consignment-mixtape.340926.html |title=Jadakiss - Consignment Hosted by DJ Drama // Free Mixtape @ |publisher=Datpiff.com |date=April 26, 2012 |access-date=December 13, 2012}}</ref>

On June 4, 2013, Jadakiss released the first single from his by then upcoming fourth studio album, ''[[Top 5, Dead or Alive]]'' titled "Big Boy Dialogue", featuring vocals from [[The-Dream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapdose.com/2013/05/30/jadakiss-big-boy-dialogue-feat-the-dream |title=Jadakiss – Big Boy Dialogue (Feat.

On March 6, 2020, Jadakiss's fifth studio album [[Ignatius (album)|Ignatius]] was released. On June 29 of the same year, Jadakiss defeated Fabolous in a battle on [[Timbaland]] and [[Swizz Beatz]]' [[Verzuz]] held virtually because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The following year, Jadakiss returned for another Verzuz battle, this time alongside the Lox against [[The Diplomats|The Diplomats (DipSet)]] live with an audience at the [[Hulu Theater]] at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The Lox were widely regarded as winning decisively, with decisive moments including Jadakiss calling out the Diplomats for using full songs including their own vocals instead of [[TV track|TV tracks]] and then performing his freestyle over The Notorious B.I.G.'s "[[Who Shot Ya?]]", originally released on his 2010 mixtape ''The Champ Is Here, Pt. 3'', and answering [[Cam'ron]]'s remark before performing "[[Welcome to New York City]]" that the Lox did not have a New York record that could not beat it  with his verse on "[[New York (Ja Rule song)|New York]]" (Jadakiss also performed the verse when Fat Joe – who was in the audience for the Lox-Diplomats Verzuz – and Ja Rule faced each other in the subsequent Verzuz at the same venue).

Following their victory, streams of Lox music increased by 215%, including Jadakiss' "Who Shot Ya?" freestyle (both studio and live versions) being added to the iTunes Store and Apple Music 11 years after its initial release.<ref>{{cite web |title=Who Shot Ya (Freestyle) - Single |author=Jadakiss |website=Apple Music |publisher=Def Jam Recordings |date=27 August 2021|access-date=17 August 2022 |url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/who-shot-ya-freestyle-single/1583113966}}</ref> Jadakiss was also dubbed "Mr. ''Verzuz''" after becoming the first artist to win two battles and was able to restructure his Def Jam contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6E2TF8uHOc |author=The Breakfast Club |title=The LOX On Showmanship, Brotherhood, Dipset Verzuz + More |website=YouTube |publisher=WWPR-FM (Power 105.1) |date=11 August 2021 |access-date=17 August 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Gee |first1=Andre |title=The Price Went Up: How The Lox Pulled Off Their Iconic "Verzuz" Victory |url=https://www.complex.com/music/the-lox-dipset-verzuz-anniversary-jadakiss-interview/ |website=Complex |date=3 August 2022|access-date=17 August 2022}}</ref> Just over a year after the battle while they were performing at [[LL Cool J]]'s Rock The Bells festival at [[Forest Hills Stadium]] in Queens, Jadakiss presented Styles P and Sheek Louch with Lox championship rings and unveiled his.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cummings-Grady |first1=Mackenzie |title=Jadakiss Gifts Styles P & Sheek Louch Championship Rings Ahead Of Benny The Butcher Mixtape |url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.72397/title.jadakiss-gifts-styles-sheek-with-championship-rings-planning-mixtape-with-benny-the-butcher# |website=HipHopDX |date=8 August 2022|access-date=17 August 2022}}</ref>

==Controversy==

===50 Cent===
In 2004, Jadakiss and [[Fat Joe]] were featured on a song by [[Ja Rule]] titled "[[New York (Ja Rule song)|New York]]". In this song, Ja Rule accuses [[50 Cent]] of being a snitch, and also takes shots at [[G-Unit]]. In turn, 50 Cent released a song titled "[[Piggy Bank (song)|Piggy Bank]]" in which he disses Fat Joe and Jadakiss among others for performing on the song.  This caused Jadakiss to release numerous 50 Cent diss tracks, including "[[Checkmate (Jadakiss song)|Checkmate]]", "Problem Child", "Shots Fired" and "I'm Sorry Ms. Jackson". 50 Cent along with his G-Unit crew responded with songs such as "I Run New York", "[[Window Shopper]]", and "Death Wish" by [[Lloyd Banks]]. Jadakiss challenged 50 Cent to an onstage battle in Madison Square Garden for 1 million dollars, but 50 Cent declined. The feud was later resolved, with Jadakiss and G-Unit performing together at 50 Cent's ThisIs50 Festival on October 3, 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622984/20091004/50_cent.jhtml| title = 50 Cent Unites NYC Hip-Hop At ThisIs50 Festival|publisher=Mtv.com|access-date=December 13, 2012}}</ref>

===Bill O'Reilly===
In 2004, [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] called Jadakiss a "smear merchant" due to lyrics in his hit song [[Why (Jadakiss song)|"Why?"]], in which Jadakiss lyrically implied [[George W. Bush]] coordinated the [[September 11 attacks]], with the line "Why do [[nigga]]s push pounds of [[cocaine|powder]]? Why did [[9/11 conspiracy theories|Bush knock down the towers]]?"<ref name=AP-2004>{{cite news| url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-07-16-jadakiss-bush_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Rapper Jadakiss blames Bush for Sept. 11 in new song | date=July 18, 2004 | access-date=May 5, 2010|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Jadakiss said the line was a metaphor for Bush administration not doing enough to stop the attacks.<ref name=AP-2004/>

In the music video for "Why?", a man holds up a picket sign reading "Buck Fush" (a [[spoonerism]] of "[[Fuck]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]]"). O'Reilly took the position that the President should be allowed to sue Jadakiss for [[slander]]. The track was eventually banned on some radio stations or played with the lyrics in question censored.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.counterbias.com/news007.html| date= May 22, 2004 | title= Rapper Jadakiss, in New Song Lyric, Suggests Bush Complicity in 9/11 Attacks| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514235803/http://www.counterbias.com/news007.html| archive-date= May 14, 2006| website= counterbias.com| access-date= April 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name=AP-2004/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,125675,00.html | work=Fox News | title=The Smearing of America Continues | first=Bill | last=O'Reilly | date=July 14, 2004}}</ref>

'''Bernard Dolan''' (born March 8, 1981) is an American [[rapper]], [[spoken word|spoken word artist]], [[activist]], screenwriter, and composer based in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].<ref name="sfrbio">Strange Famous Records [http://www.strangefamousrecords.com/b-dolan/ B. Dolan Biography]</ref>

==History==
B. Dolan's first performances took place at New York City's [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]], where he gained respect as part of [[HBO]]'s ''[[Def Poetry]]'' in 2002 and won numerous slam titles.<ref name="bostonphoenix">Boston Phoenix [http://thephoenix.com/boston/music/115340-b-dolan-goes-where-few-mcs-have-gone-before/ B. Dolan Goes Where Few Emcees Have Gone Before]</ref> He has since distanced himself from and criticized [[slam poetry]]. In 2011, he told the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]'':<blockquote>Doing spoken word was the first time I ever tried to present my writing on a stage, and that's what it was good for.  It taught me some basic stage tricks that I still use — like how to change my voice and talk to a crowd. But once you've picked up those chops, you need to get the hell out before you become some asshole who wins the poetry slam for the 10th year in a row.<ref name="bostonphoenix"/></blockquote>

After performing at a Def Jam industry party at the Rush Arts Gallery, B. Dolan realized he wouldn't be able to work within the major label structure. Within months, he dropped out of college, bought a drum machine, and began recording the first album ''The Failure''.<ref name="bostonphoenix"/> During this time, he slept on "park benches and subway trains" while working as a doorman at a building in close proximity to the Twin Towers. It was at this time that the [[September 11 attacks]] happened, leaving B. Dolan in a "paranoid mental state", which caused him to move back to [[Rhode Island]].<ref name="sfrbio"/>

Once back in Rhode Island, B. Dolan tapped into the local arts community, volunteered for at-risk youth programs, created the consumer activist website Knowmore.org, teamed up with [[Sage Francis]], signed to [[Strange Famous Records]], and began to tour internationally since 2005.

B. Dolan has also remained prolific as a rapper, releasing albums on Strange Famous Records since 2008 and most notably creating the "Bombzo Way" and "Evel Knievel" characters, which make surprise guest appearances at his concerts.<ref name="sfrbio"/><ref name="bostonphoenix"/> In 2010, he released his second album ''[[Fallen House, Sunken City]]'', the entirety of which is produced by [[Alias (artist)|Alias]] of [[Anticon]].<ref>URB [http://www.urb.com/2010/03/21/b-dolan-fallen-house-sunken-city/ B. Dolan – Fallen House, Sunken City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101092507/http://www.urb.com/2010/03/21/b-dolan-fallen-house-sunken-city/ |date=2014-01-01 }}</ref>

In 2011, B. Dolan created the package show ''The Church of Love & Ruin'', which combined activism and art by bringing openly LGBT and Queer performers into the arena of hip hop, in an attempt to address homophobia in rap.<ref name="bostonphoenix"/><ref>Boston Globe [http://articles.boston.com/2011-02-11/ae/29346299_1_hip-hop-show-show-hosts-sage-francis The Grand Experiment of B.

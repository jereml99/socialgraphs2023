== Musical career ==
After dropping out of college in 2008, Jahlil Beats returned to his city where he would meet upcoming rapper [[Meek Mill]]. Shortly after meeting, they collaborated with each other frequently.

== Production style ==
Although he used [[sample (music)|samples]] early in his career, Beats has stated that he is moving away from using samples in his music: "I ain't trying to share my publishing. If you sample they might take 80%, leave you with 20. They getting paid off a record they did 20 years ago. So I like to do a lot of my stuff from scratch because I want all my publishing. I'm stingy with mine."<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.24652/title.jahlil-beats-details-meek-mill-dream-chasers-3-work Jahlil Beats Details Meek Mill "Dream Chasers 3" Work | Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales | HipHop DX<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In most of his songs, there can be siren heard throughout the beat. His songs also contain a production tag of his then three-year-old niece saying "Jahlil Beats Holla At Me".<ref name="Sharp2012" />

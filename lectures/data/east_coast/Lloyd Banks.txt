==Career==
===Beginnings with G-Unit (1999–2004)===
{{Main|G-Unit}}

[[G-Unit]] was founded when childhood friends Lloyd Banks, [[50 Cent]], and [[Tony Yayo]] decided to form a group.<ref name="allmusic"/> They met [[Young Buck]] when [[UTP Records|UTP]] group came to New York and  50 Cent heard Young Buck rapping. After 50 Cent signed his contract with Aftermath Entertainment they took Young Buck in the group and signed him.
Tony Yayo, being an older and more experienced rapper, joined 50 Cent on the Nas Promo Tour, the Cash Money Tour and the Ruff Ryders Tour. As Banks remained at home waiting for 50 and Yayo to return, he started rapping around the neighborhood to further increase his buzz on the streets. He then hooked up with neighborhood producers and recorded tracks for local mixtapes, becoming renowned on the mixtape scene. While Banks was recording Mixtapes,<ref name="AskMen">[http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_150/165c_lloyd_banks.html Lloyd Banks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227035911/http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_150/165c_lloyd_banks.html |date=February 27, 2008 }}. Askmen. Accessed July 29, 2009.</ref> 50 Cent was soon granted his own record label by [[Dr. Dre]] and released the album ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin'<nowiki/>]]''; Lloyd Banks was featured on the song "Don't Push Me", and the remixed version of "[[P.I.M.P]]". Soon after the group had established their own record label, [[G-Unit Records]], G-Unit released their first official group album ''[[Beg for Mercy]]'' in November 2003, which went on to be certified double platinum.<ref name="Beg for Mercy">{{cite web|last=Lamy |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=2003&resultpage=&id=D567432C-1DD7-2B70-27E8-161B2A3E9F22 |title=2003 Ends With a Bang! |publisher=RIAA |date=December 18, 2003 |access-date=July 24, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201035/http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=2003&resultpage=&id=D567432C-1DD7-2B70-27E8-161B2A3E9F22 |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref>

====Shooting====
On September 10, 2001, Banks was shot twice while leaving a nightclub in Southside Jamaica, Queens.  He was hit in the back and stomach, and ran to the nearest hospital after suffering the injuries. He woke up the next morning to news of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and watched from his hospital bed as the Twin Towers fell to the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/01/a-history-of-rappers-getting-shot-and-surviving/lloyd-banks|title=Lloyd Banks|author=David Drake|date=January 28, 2013|work=Complex}}</ref>

====Legal Issues====

During August 2005, Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, and their entourage were traveling in a van, when the vehicle was pulled over after passing through a red light in midtown Manhattan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1507266/20050809/young_buck.jhtml|title=Young Buck, Lloyd Banks Arrested For Gun Possession|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|date=August 9, 2005|publisher=MTV News|access-date=June 6, 2009}}</ref> Officers said they discovered a loaded handgun and another weapon in the van. Prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss the charges after an investigation determined that neither Lloyd Banks nor Young Buck were in possession of the weapons. Felony gun charges against Lloyd Banks and Young Buck were dropped on November 8, 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1545226/20061108/banks_lloyd.jhtml|title=For The Record: Quick News On Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, Jay-Z, Michael Jackson, Reese Witherspoon & More|date=November 8, 2006|publisher=MTV News|access-date=June 6, 2009}}</ref>

====Feud with The Game====

The most well known feud involving Lloyd Banks is the feud between himself and [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], which became public after The Game left G-Unit. Banks speculates that The Game was jealous about the attention Banks received after the success of his debut album ''[[The Hunger for More]]'' as well as Banks winning a lyricist title.<ref>[http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2006/06/lloyd_banks_bet_the_bank_on_it/ "Lloyd Banks Speculating On Game"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303011351/http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2006/06/lloyd_banks_bet_the_bank_on_it/ |date=March 3, 2007 }}, ''Vibe'', June 2006.

===Solo career and ''The Hunger for More'' (2004–2005)===
{{Main|The Hunger for More}}
Lloyd Banks released his solo debut album ''[[The Hunger for More]]'' in June 2004. The first single was the summer smash hit "[[On Fire (Lloyd Banks song)|On Fire]]" which featured 50 Cent, however he was uncredited.
Banks explained the reasoning behind the album's title:
{{cquote|When I say The Hunger for More, it could be referring to more success. It could be more money. Or Respect. More power. More understanding. All those things lead up to that hunger for more, because my more isn't everybody else's more.

''The Big Withdrawal'' was originally intended to be Lloyd Banks' second album. The album was leaked to the internet after Banks had a [[Threesome|ménage à trois]] encounter with two women and left the CD album behind.<ref name="SOHH">Carl Chery (December 25, 2007).

RapSearch. Accessed August 25, 2007.</ref>
During an interview, Lloyd Banks commented on the issue, he said: {{blockquote|It's truth to that rumor. That comes from me doing too much. I was just lost in my ways, fucked two women at one time. It's the little things you don't pay attention to. I had the CD in an actual DJ Whoo Kid mixtape cover. It was just a blank CD with just tracks. I got over 70, 80 tracks, so you can't get them all on one CD. So I might have had 14 tracks of the last two weeks or something like that. Next thing I know, [I] can't find the CD. I'm assuming it had to be from one of those situations when you got too much going on around you. Maybe I'mma just stick to one girl from now on. That's the only explanation that makes sense. Sticky fingers.<ref name="SOHH"/>}}

Due to the leak, Lloyd Banks began work on ''[[Rotten Apple (Lloyd Banks album)|Rotten Apple]]''. "Rotten Apple" is a play on New York City's nickname "The Big Apple". It was released on October 10, 2006. The album debuted at #3, selling 143,000 copies in its first week. ''Rotten Apple'' was not considered as a commercial success because his debut album sold a significantly higher number of copies in its first week. He has released three singles from ''Rotten Apple'': "Hands Up", "The Cake", and "Help".<ref>[http://www.rapsearch.com/news/index.php?itemid=1323 Lloyd Banks-Rotten Apple].

I don't even know he couldn't even tell you like at any point when you speak to him where the problem is. I put him like where I put Marquise like they just have something internal going on with them that gives them some sort of resentment towards me and I just don't even care about whats going on".<ref>{{Citation|title=50 cent speaks on beef with Lloyd banks!

Lloyd banks hasn't spoke on the matter publicly however he has sent words that seem to be aimed at 50 cent on numerous songs including cold summer freestyle and Stranger Things. In-between Lloyd banks departure from G-Unit and June 2021 Lloyd banks remained relatively quiet other than introducing a clothing line and touring places such as Australia, Lloyd banks wasn't doing interviews or releasing any new projects other than some freestyles in fact Lloyd banks hadn't released a new project since his mixtape Halloween Havoc 3 in 2016. He would also go on to twitter to tweet things such as "Let's be real..ain't nobody checking for banks anymore" leaving fans wondering if Lloyd banks was done with music. However fans would be surprised as in April 2021 he would release a  post on Instagram that teased possible new music which continued on to May 25 were a video was released with a brief spoken-word monologue from poet Rashan Brown and on May 25 a tracklist and cover art was revealed. The album was released on June 4, 2021, as his 4th album and first album in 11 years named ''The Course of the Inevitable'' which sold 12,000 copies in its first week. The album received very positive reviews and Lloyd banks seemed happy with the reception as he spoke about more upcoming music at a concert he held in Sony Hall.

{{blockquote|When I won the mixtape artist of the year 2004, after that I didn't want to get away from it because that right there is where I got my satisfaction, from the fans giving me that award. It wasn't like an award show when you got some big fat guys in suits on the podium that never even heard my album giving me a rating or judging what I deserve... that's actually my most proudest trophy right now.<ref>[http://music.aol.com/videos/sessions/live-performance-archive/lloyd-banks Lloyd Banks AOL Session-Comments on Mixtape Award In Q&A].

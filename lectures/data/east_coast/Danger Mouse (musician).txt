== Music career ==
While in Athens, Burton took second place in a 1998 talent contest and was asked to open for a concert at the [[University of Georgia]] featuring [[OutKast]] and [[Goodie Mob]]. Afterwards, Burton claims he approached CeeLo Green, a member of Goodie Mob, and gave him an instrumental demo tape. CeeLo has no recollection of this and the instrumental demo tape's existence has never been confirmed. Trey Reames who had promoted CeeLo's first solo shows in Georgia, moved to London and became Burton's first manager. He suggested and negotiated CeeLo's appearance on the 26' Remix of the Danger Mouse and Jemini record. When Burton met CeeLo for this project, he shared some beats which led them to collaborate as Gnarls Barkley.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/magazine/18barkley.html?ex=1308283200&en=d69638926b798ed5&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss| title=The D.J.

Danger Mouse was announced as the producer for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] eleventh album and that he would replace [[Rick Rubin]], the producer of the band's previous six albums dating back to 1991. Production began in February 2015. The production was halted due to an injury the band's bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] suffered during a skiing trip. It resumed in August 2015 and continued into early 2016. ''[[The Getaway (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|The Getaway]]'' was released in June 2016 with Danger Mouse performing on and having co-writing credits on many of the songs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.alternativenation.net/red-hot-chili-peppers-reveal-producer-new-album/ |work=Alternative Nation |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Reveal Producer Of New Album |date=February 2, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202155425/http://www.alternativenation.net/red-hot-chili-peppers-reveal-producer-new-album/ |archive-date=February 2, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RHCPchad/status/607011145577197568|title=Chad Smith on Twitter|work=Twitter}}</ref>

In March 2017, [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] singer [[Anthony Kiedis]] indicated that the band would likely want to work again with Danger Mouse on the follow-up to ''The Getaway''. Kiedis stated "I think it's good to work with the same guy again to um, you know you had your freshman experience. I think we owe it to ourselves to start from the beginning with this guy and see what we can accomplish."<ref>{{Citation|last=CFOXVideos|title=Anthony Kiedis Interview.

== Philosophy ==
In an interview for ''The New York Times'' magazine, Danger Mouse was compared to a film [[auteur]], basing his music production philosophy on the cinematic philosophy of directors like [[Woody Allen]]. "Woody Allen was an auteur: he did his thing, and that particular thing was completely his own", he said. "That's what I decided to do with music. I want to create a director's role within music, which is what I tried to do on this album (''[[St. Elsewhere (album)|St. Elsewhere]]'')... I can create different kinds of musical worlds, but the artist needs the desire to go into that world... Musically, there is no one who has the career I want. That's why I have to use film directors as a model."<ref name=autogenerated1 />

'''James Timothy "Tim" Holland Jr.''' (born September 25, 1977), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Sole''', is an American [[underground hip hop]] artist from [[Portland, Maine]]. He is one of eight co-founders of the record label [[Anticon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xlr8r.com/news/2010/02/sole-ends-his-time-anticon|title=sole Ends His Time at anticon|publisher=XLR8R|first=Thomas|last=Rees|date=February 11, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145912/http://www.xlr8r.com/news/2010/02/sole-ends-his-time-anticon|archive-date=April 13, 2014}}</ref> He has been a member of the groups Northern Exposure, Live Poets, [[Deep Puddle Dynamics]], So-Called Artists, Da Babylonianz, [[Sole and the Skyrider Band]] and Waco Boyz.

==Career==
Sole recorded his first demo in 1992. At age 15, he assembled 45 Below Records, which included rappers [[Alias (artist)|Alias]], JD Walker, and producer DJ Moodswing9 (then known as Cuz the Highlander). Sole and Moodswing9 released the album ''Mad Skillz and Unpaid Billz'' together as Northern Exposure, selling more than 300 copies. In 1997, Sole released a 12" as Live Poets with JD Walker and Moodswing9. It garnered college radio play and sold a few thousand copies.

In early 1998, Sole and rapper [[Pedestrian (rapper)|Pedestrian]] coined the name [[Anticon]] and together started a collectively owned record label under the name. Later it was set up as a standard corporation with eight shareholders. In the same year, Sole traveled to [[Minneapolis]] with Alias and [[Doseone]]. They recorded the album ''[[The Taste of Rain... Why Kneel?]]'' as [[Deep Puddle Dynamics]] with [[Slug (rapper)|Slug]] of [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]]. Sole and Pedestrian moved Anticon to [[Oakland, California]].

In 2000, Sole released the first official solo album ''[[Bottle of Humans]]'' on Anticon. As [[So-Called Artists]], he released ''[[Paint by Number Songs]]'' with Alias and [[DJ Mayonnaise]] in 2001. Sole's second solo album ''[[Selling Live Water]]'' was released in 2003 and received positive reviews; [[Pitchfork Media]] gave it a 7.3,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7319-selling-live-water/|title=Sole: Selling Live Water|publisher=Pitchfork Media|first=Chris|last=Dahlen|date=March 26, 2003}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave it a score of 77 out of 100.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/selling-live-water |title=Selling Live Water |website=[[Metacritic]] }}</ref>

Later that year, he moved to [[Barcelona]]. Two years later, he released the third solo album ''[[Live from Rome]]'' in 2005. Soon after, he moved back to the United States, relocating to [[Flagstaff, Arizona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://madisonhouseinc.com/sole-and-skyrider-band|title=Sole and the Skyrider Band|publisher=Madison House|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515154056/http://madisonhouseinc.com/sole-and-skyrider-band|archive-date=2012-05-15}}</ref>

In 2007, Sole released ''[[Sole and the Skyrider Band (album)|Sole and the Skyrider Band]]'' as [[Sole and the Skyrider Band]]. Its second album ''[[Plastique (album)|Plastique]]'' was released in 2009. In 2010, Sole left Anticon, citing a desire to further experiment with his music, independently of the collective, and also due to his belief that the label developed away from what he initially intended it to be.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/37845-sole-leaves-anticon/|title=Sole Leaves Anticon|publisher=Pitchfork Media|first=Tom|last=Breihanon|date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> Sole and the Skyrider Band then released its third album. ''[[Hello Cruel World (2011)|Hello Cruel World]]'' was released in 2011 to generally positive reviews.

Aside from his official releases on Anticon, Sole has also released self-produced albums on his own imprint Black Canyon. These include various compilations of unreleased material, as well as the releases of his Man's Best Friend project, various mixtapes, and collaborations with platinum certified producer DJ Pain 1. As he is no longer with Anticon, Sole currently self-releases his solo records.

==Personal life==
Sole is based in [[Brunswick, Maine]]. He married Yasamin Al-Hussaini on January 1, 2004, and her name is referenced occasionally in his lyrics. While living in Denver, Sole was active in the local outpost of the [[Occupy Wall Street]] political movement,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/02/sole-denver-based-hip-hop_n_1071946.html|title=Sole, Denver-Based Hip-Hop Artist And Member Of #OccupyDenver, Talks Music And Life As An Occupier|work=The Huffington Post|first=Matt|last=Ferner|date=January 30, 2012}}</ref> various anarchist projects<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soleone.org/news/2015/8/16/in-depth-interview-with-its-going-down|title=In Depth Interview with Its Going Down|website=SOLE|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref> and hosts a podcast about revolutionary politics and radical philosophy called "The Solecast."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soleone.org/|title=Soleone.org|website=SOLE|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>

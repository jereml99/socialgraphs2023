'''Jonathan Burks''' (born October 4, 1964), better known by his stage name '''Jaz-O''' (formerly '''The Jaz''' and '''Big Jaz'''), is an American [[rapper]] and [[record producer]]. Active in the late 1980s through the 1990s, and best known for being the mentor of Brooklyn rapper [[Jay-Z]], Burks is nicknamed "the Originator", and had a song titled "[[The Originators (The Jaz song)|The Originators]]" that featured a young Jay-Z in 1990.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jay-z/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504224055/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jay-z/biography|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 4, 2011|title=Jay-Z Biography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=2018-01-08}}</ref>

==Early life==
Jonathan Burks was born in the [[Brooklyn]] borough of [[New York City]] and raised in [[Marcy Houses]], a housing project in the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood. Originally attending college to become an [[accountant]], he decided to become a rapper after being encouraged by a friend, and being inspired after hearing [[UTFO]]'s "[[Roxanne, Roxanne]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/jaz-o-is-the-originator-reflections-on-jay-z-big-and-creating-the-triplet-flow-news.88588.html|title=Jaz-O Is The Originator: Reflections On Jay-Z, B.I.G, & Creating The Triplet Flow|website=www.hotnewhiphop.com|first=Mitch|last=Finlay|date=August 19, 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early years and signing with EMI USA===
Being from the [[Marcy Projects|same projects]] as Jay-Z, the two would meet and become friends, with Jaz-O being a rhyme mentor to Jay-Z. Sometime during the year of 1986, the two lyricists would soon form a short-lived group by the name of High Potent. Despite the group being short-lived, the two recorded and released several songs throughout 1986, before Jaz-O would go on and get a record deal with [[EMI America Records|EMI USA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2015/06/most-heads-dont-know-that-jay-zs-first-record-was-in-1986-audio/|title=Jay Z's First Record Ever Was in 1986…And It Was Not Hawaiian Sophie. Take a Listen (Audio)|website=www.ambrosiaforheads.com|author=Bandini|date=June 18, 2015}}</ref> In regards to the signing, he stated:

<blockquote>I had been rhyming since I was 14. Do the math on your own! I became a legend on the east coast - which in the 'eighties' was quite remarkable, in about six years. I was always told I was the best most had ever heard. I put out a song in 1985 called "HP Gets Busy" on our own label (my manager at the time, Jack Walker and I), featuring two of my comrades from [[Long Island, NY]], and my young apprentice, Jay Z. We did shows regionally; NY and Pittsburgh mostly. Meanwhile, I was recording with friend and producer, Fresh Gordon. He helped me get a single deal on [[Tommy Boy Records]] after I collaborated on a song with him called "My [[Fila (company)|Fila]]" (a response to [[Run DMC]]'s, "[[My Adidas]]"). A mutual friend of Gordon and I, Marlon Prescott, introduced me to my soon-to-be manager at that time, Stan Poses. In four months Stan solidified a major artist deal for me, and I became the first rap artist ever to sign with EMI Records. I also became the recipient of the largest advance and recording budget of any rap artist at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanjazz.org/Jaz-O_interview.htm?LMCL=h80_1v|title=Jaz-O Interview|website=www.urbanjazz.org}}</ref></blockquote>

===1989: ''Word to the Jaz''===
Several months after signing with EMI USA, Jaz-O went on a trip to [[London]], where he would record his debut album. Joining him on the trip was Jay-Z, as well as future [[Murder Inc Records]] CEO and producer [[Irv Gotti]], who was Jaz-O's DJ at the time. After completion, Jaz-O released his debut album ''[[Word to the Jaz]].'' The album was produced by Bryan "Chuck" New, Pete Q. Harris and Jaz-O himself. The album peaked at number 87 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-jaz/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-albums/song/375408|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514020611/https://www.billboard.com/music/the-jaz/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-albums/song/375408|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 14, 2018|title=The Jaz Word To The Jaz Chart History|work=[[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]]|access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref> It featured a guest appearance from [[Jay-Z]] on the song "Hawaiian Sophie", which peaked at number 18 on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-jaz/chart-history/rap-song/song/321004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509055208/https://www.billboard.com/music/the-jaz/chart-history/rap-song/song/321004|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 9, 2018|title=The Jaz Hawaiian Sophie Chart History|work=[[Hot Rap Songs]]|access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref> The single "Let's Play House"/"Buss the Speaker" peaked at number 26 on the ''Billboard'' [[Dance Club Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-jaz/chart-history/dance-club-play-songs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514014945/https://www.billboard.com/music/the-jaz/chart-history/dance-club-play-songs|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 14, 2018|title=The Jaz Chart History|work=[[Dance Club Songs]]|access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref>

Jaz-O also made a [[guest appearance]] on [[The O'Jays]]'s "[[Have You Had Your Love Today]]", which was a single released from their 1989 album ''Serious''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-OJays-Serious/release/1933597|title=The O'Jays – Serious (1989, CD)|via=www.discogs.com}}</ref>

===1990: ''To Your Soul''===
Jaz-O released his second album ''[[To Your Soul]]'' on July 16, 1990. Despite the album not reaching the [[Billboard charts]], its two singles, "The Originators" and "A Groove (This Is What U Rap 2)", peaked at No. 13 and No. 18, respectively, on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-jaz/chart-history/rap-song|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514020521/https://www.billboard.com/music/the-jaz/chart-history/rap-song|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 14, 2018|title=The Jaz Chart History|work=[[Hot Rap Songs]]|access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref> Similar to his debut album, Jay-Z was the only guest, being featured on two songs.

===1991–1996: Production work behind the scenes===
Sometime after the album was released, Jaz-O was dropped from his record label and began to spend time working behind the scenes as a producer. At some point, Jaz-O connected with [[The Lox]], and produced a demo tape for the group, which would become instrumental to the start of their successful career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rfdtv.com/story/41673418/kingz-kounty-media-group-presents-jaz-os-new-ep-the-warmup-available-february-7th-on-all-platforms-via-equity-distribution|website=www.rfdtv.com|title=Kingz Kounty Media Group Presents Jaz-O's New EP "The WarmUp" Available February 7th on All Platforms Via Equity Distribution|date=February 7, 2020|access-date=February 20, 2020|archive-date=February 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220070122/https://www.rfdtv.com/story/41673418/kingz-kounty-media-group-presents-jaz-os-new-ep-the-warmup-available-february-7th-on-all-platforms-via-equity-distribution|url-status=dead}}</ref> Fellow [[Yonkers]] native [[Mary J.

Becoming a supporter of the group, Blige would pass the demo tape on to [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]] CEO [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puffy" Combs]] while on a tour with [[Jodeci]].

===1996–1998: Involvement with Jay-Z's early success===
Throughout the late 1990s, Jaz-O had quite a hand in Jay-Z's early solo success. Jaz-O produced, and was featured on "[[Ain't No Nigga]]," the second single from Jay-Z's 1996 debut album, ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]''. The song is cited as playing a significant role in securing Jay-Z's record with [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]].<ref name="hitquarters.com">[http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Nick_Raphael_Interview.html "Interview With Nick Raphael"], ''[[HitQuarters]]'', 25 May 2005.</ref>

Jaz-O then produced "Rap Game / Crack Game," a track that appeared on Jay's second album ''[[In My Lifetime, Vol. 1]]'', released in 1997.

Jaz-O also produced two tracks for Jay-Z's ''[[Streets Is Watching (soundtrack)|Streets Is Watching]]''. The album fared well commercially reaching #3 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and was released on May 12, 1998, by [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] and [[Def Jam Recordings]].

In 1999, Jaz-O appeared on Jay-Z's "[[Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)]]", a single that was released from Jay-Z's third album ''[[Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life]].'' The song became a big hit in Jaz-O's career at the time. However, this would be one of the last times the two would work together on music, for their friendship soured shortly afterwards.

=== 1999–2016: Feud with Jay-Z and forming Kingz Kounty ===
The long-standing feud between him and Jay-Z started when Jay-Z started [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] and tried to convince Jaz-O and fellow rapper [[Sauce Money]] to sign with the label. They both refused. It is rumored that they did not trust Roc-A-Fella Records CEO [[Damon Dash]] and label co-founder Kareem "Biggs" Burke. In addition, they were not satisfied with what they were to receive had they signed the contract ($300,000 in Jaz-O's case). Jay-Z confirmed this event on the song "What We Talkin' About" from the ''[[Blueprint 3]]'' album where he raps "Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps, he could've made more but he ain't sign his contract".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/07/20-rappers-who-almost-signed-to-other-labels/jaz-o|title=20 Rappers Who Almost Signed To Other LabelsJaz-O|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|access-date=2018-01-08}}</ref>

Instead of signing with Roc-A-Fella Records, Jaz-O inked a deal with Rancore Records, and formed the hip-hop group Immobilarie. With the group, he released a collaboration album titled ''[[Jaz-O & The Immobilarie Family Present: Kingz Kounty]].''

Jay-Z went on to diss Jaz first on a track titled "Fuck Jaz-O AKA Jaz Ho", released by [[DJ Kayslay]] and featuring [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]], Geda K, [[Young Gunz|Young Chris]], and [[Memphis Bleek]]. On the song, in which they rapped over [[Styles P]]'s "[[Good Times (Styles P song)|Good Times]]" instrumental, and later on his album ''[[The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse]]'', Jay-Z states: "I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O." Jaz then responded with a record titled  "Ova"  on a DJ Kayslay mixtape, and after the response from Jay-Z and the members of Roc-A-Fella, he released the diss record response known as "Ova Part 2" in which he raps over [[N.O.R.E.]]'s "[[Nothin' (song)|Nothin']]" instrumental.

During the long-standing feud between mentor and protégé, Jay-Z would still give Jaz-O credit for his success (while dissing him at the same time) as heard in the song "I Do It For Hip Hop" on [[Ludacris]]'s ''[[Theater of the Mind]]'' album, where Jay-Z says "Shout out to [[Grand Master Flash]] and to [[Grandmaster Caz|Caz]] and even Jaz's bum ass".

Soon after the "I Do It For Hip Hop" diss from Jay-Z, Jaz-O responded with his own diss record titled "Go Harder" which starts with Jaz-O rapping over his protege's "Brooklyn Go Hard" beat before the beat changes.

In late August 2009, Jaz-O was featured on another song dissing Jay-Z, titled "Gangstas Ride" with West Coast rapper, [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]]. Jaz references "Ether" with the line, "Jaz-O, stupid motherfucker, not Shawn, never been bashed on a [[Tupac]] song". The song was fueled by beef between Game and Jay-Z at the time.

===2017–2020: Reunion with Jay-Z and signing with Roc Nation===
In December 2017, Jaz-O and Jay-Z  reunited at Jay-Z's [[4:44 (album)|''4:44'']] concert, seemingly ending their feud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/12/jay-z-jaz-o-reunite-444-tour-chicago/|title=Jay-Z and Jaz-O Reunite at 4:44 Tour Stop in Chicago - XXL|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL Mag]]|access-date=2018-01-08}}</ref> In 2019, it was reported that the two had worked out a music deal for Jaz-O's Kingz Kounty Media Group to be distributed through [[Roc Nation]]'s Equity Distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onsmash.com/music/jay-z-signs-jaz-o-to-roc-nation/|title=JAY-Z Signs Jaz-O to Roc Nation after Ending Beef|website=onsmashmusic.com|author=VIRAL MVP|date=July 9, 2019}}</ref>

On February 7, 2020, Jaz-O released an extended play (EP) titled ''[[The Warmup EP|The Warmup]]'', on Kingz Kounty Media Group. It was distributed by Roc Nation's Equity Distribution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grungecake.com/jaz-o-the-warmup-review/articles/62893|title = JAY-Z's mentor Jaz-O picks up where he left off with ten-track effort 'The Warmup': Listen – GRUNGECAKE| date=8 February 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weeklyrapgods.com/2020/02/10/jaz-o-new-the-warm-up-project/|title=Jaz-O Raises the Bar In New 'The Warm Up' Project|date=February 10, 2020|website=Weekly Rap Gods}}</ref>

=== 2021: Other ventures and releases ===
Jaz-O has since moved his 'Kingz Kounty Music Group" to Rival Distribution. He released "Lookin' Like", a collaboration single with [[Nipsey Hussle]], on July 2, 2021. The song's music video was directed by Da Inphamus Amadeuz.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-06-10|title=Jaz-O "Lookin Like" Single Set To Drop|url=https://boombapnation.com/jaz-o-lookin-like-single-set-to-drop/|access-date=2021-06-24|website=Boom Bap Nation|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Musical style==
===Influences===
Jaz-O cites [[Grandmaster Caz]] as an early influence. Caz was the artist who made Jaz-O decide to become a rapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1453361/jaz-o-reminds-world-where-jay-z-got-his-blueprint/|title=Jaz-O Reminds World Where Jay-Z Got His Blueprint|website=www.mtv.com|author=Soren Baker|date=April 10, 2002|quote=When I heard Grandmaster Caz, it was like a light came on. His timing was just perfect, his voice was perfect and he wrote all of the routines that the Cold Crush did. A lot of them were jingles from old pop and R&B songs, but it was crazy the way he flipped them. I didn't know it could be like that. From that day on, I endeavored to get my timing like that, to have the same clarity and vocal punch.}}</ref>

===Rhyming style===
Jaz-O was the rapper to pioneer the triplet flow, which allows the rapper to flow far beyond sixteen syllables within the 4/4 [[time signature]], being able to add extra syllables to the sixteen multiplies the syllables into twenty-fourths, which makes a triplet of an eighth. Since the 1990s, the triplet [[rhyme technique]] has become a common distinction among some of the most respected hip-hop lyricists. Several rappers who are well known for the technique include his former apprentice [[Jay-Z]], [[Twista]], and [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]], as well as [[Fu-Schnickens]], [[Spice-1]], and [[Tech N9ne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/jaz-o-is-the-originator-reflections-on-jay-z-big-and-creating-the-triplet-flow-news.88588.html|title=Jaz-O Is The Originator: Reflections On Jay-Z, B.I.G, & Creating The Triplet Flow|website=www.hotnewhiphop.com|first=Mitch|last=Finlay|date=August 19, 2019|quote=The reason I did it was because in one-sixteenth cadence and your average 4/4 time signature beat, if you have more than sixteen syllables in a measure, all of the sudden, you’re stuck with a dilemma to express yourself in a certain way or to get your point across the way you choose. I had to stuff those words, those extra syllables in the sixteen so it would transform those syllables into twenty-fourths, which became a triplet of an eighth. That’s why I called it the triplet style.}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Jaz-O was known to be a visible figure in the [[Nuwaubian Nation]] during the 1980s. Nuwaubian beliefs and symbolism were prominent in the earlier years of his music career, and Nuwaubian fashion influenced his wardrobe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopmindcontrol.com/jayz.htm|title=Jay-Z got his start rapping alongside Jaz-O.

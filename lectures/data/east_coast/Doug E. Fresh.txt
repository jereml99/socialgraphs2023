'''Douglas Davis''', known professionally as '''Doug E. Fresh''', (born September 17, 1966) is a [[Barbados]]-born American rapper, record producer, and [[beatboxing|beatboxer]], also known as the '''"Human Beat Box"'''. The pioneer of 20th-century American [[beatboxing]], Fresh is able to accurately imitate [[drum machine]]s and various [[special effect]]s using only his [[human mouth|mouth]], [[lip]]s, [[gums]], [[throat]], [[tongue]] and a [[microphone]].

In the early 1980s he formed the Get Fresh Crew with DJs Chill Will and Barry B and later added rapper [[Slick Rick]].  Two of their songs "[[The Show (Doug E. Fresh song)|The Show]]" and "[[La Di Da Di]]" are considered early [[hip hop music|hip hop]] classics.  "La Di Da Di", in particular, is one of the most [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] songs in music history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-la-di-da-di-a-b-side-from-1985-became-one-of-musics-most-sampled-songs-11558522800 |title=How 'La Di Da Di,' a B-Side From 1985, Became One of Music's Most-Sampled Songs |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Michael |last=Driscoll |date=May 22, 2019}}</ref>

==Early life==
Doug E. Fresh was born in [[Barbados]] with other family roots in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] as well. Fresh's grandfather came to [[Harlem, New York|Harlem]] who raised him alongside his mother. Fresh went to a school with a music program, where he played drums, percussion and the trumpet. The school then cut the budget of the music department and Fresh had to return the trumpet back.<ref name = 'wpost' />

Fresh became acquainted with rapping from his brother bringing tapes of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] and [[DJ Hollywood]] into the house. Locally on the neighbourhood block there was a group called D & D Express with one of the members known as Teddy D, Teddy's nephews were making hip hop in the basement of a store playing on a turntable and experimenting with the echo chamber. It was there that Fresh would join in on the mic and start to rap. While in school he would write rhymes for poetry, as he was a big of fan of [[Langston Hughes]], where he also won the local Langston Hughes award. During this time several local groups popped up including ''Ray Von and Johnny Wa'', ''Harlem World'', ''Celebrity Club'', and ''Randy’s Place'', the groups would throw parties in cafeterias of surrounding elementary and high schools in which Fresh would attend the parties. In Fresh's personal crew he had Damon and James who were cousins, as a group they were big fans of [[The Cold Crush Brothers]] so they named themselves the ''Cold Cash Crew''. At this time Fresh went by several names including ''Dougie Doug'', ''Dougie D'', ''Law-D'', ''Dougie Doug the Prince of Love'', and ''Christian D and the Criss Cross Crew''. The name Doug E. Fresh came from someone at school doing an art piece of his name on the wall and he told them to list him as ''Dougie’s Fresh'' but the person incorrectly spelled it out as "Doug E. Fresh" instead. With his new name he would go to other schools and rap battle.<ref name= 'fatlace'>{{cite web | url=http://fatlacemagazine.com/2008/10/doug-e-fresh-interview/ | title=Fat Lace Magazine » Doug e. Fresh Interview }}</ref>

As for beatboxing, walking home after school every day Fresh would pass by the mom and pop record shop owned by [[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]] where records would play outside of the store to passerby's. He would hear records from artists like [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Spoonie Gee]], [[Funky 4 + 1]], and practice humming along to the bass-lines of the songs. One day outside listening to records, Fresh would try beatboxing in between records to which his friends reacted enthusiastically.<ref name= 'fatlace' /> Word of Fresh's skills spread further at a party in a park in the ''Lincoln Projects'' in [[East Harlem]], where he rapped and beatboxed live.<ref name = 'wpost'>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/qanda-with-doug-e-fresh-how-the-rapper-and-producer-became-the-human-beat-box/2020/07/16/c90e7a4c-c60e-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html |title=Q&A with Doug E.

==Music career==
Fresh began his recording career as a solo [[artist]]; he was among the last artists on [[Enjoy Records]] and one of the first on Vintertainment Records (the same New York-based label owned by Vincent Davis that would later make a name for hip-hop artist Joeski Love and bring [[R&B]] singer [[Keith Sweat]] to ultimate fame). He and a new team of DJs known as the Get Fresh Crew (Barry Bee and Chill Will), along with newcomer MC Ricky D (who would later achieve fame as [[Slick Rick]]), came to fledgling New Jersey-based hip-hop label [[Fantasy Records|Danya/Reality Records]] the following year and recorded "[[The Show (Doug E. Fresh song)|The Show]]", which borrowed the melody of the ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' theme by [[Shuki Levy]].<ref>Blow Your Mind Wide Open, Charles Mudede, ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', August 28, 2003.</ref> They also recorded "[[La Di Da Di]]", a tune that was completely voiced by MC Ricky D and backed by Doug E. Fresh's beatboxing for the entire duration of the song. The release of these two songs as a 12" single launched Doug E. Fresh (and Slick Rick) into stardom. Both songs are considered among the greatest early [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] classics. "The Show" peaked at #7 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in December 1985.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Doug E. Fresh was interviewed in the 1986 cult documentary ''[[Big Fun In The Big Town]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2323202/|title=Big Fun in the Big Town|website=IMDb.com|access-date=October 13, 2019}}</ref> Slick Rick left the group almost a year after the release of "The Show"/"La Di Da Di" single, reappearing in 1988 as a [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] artist and releasing his debut album, ''[[The Great Adventures of Slick Rick]]''. Doug E. Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew continued on, now officially signed to Danya/Reality/Fantasy, by releasing ''[[Oh, My God! (Doug E. Fresh album)|Oh, My God!]]'' in 1986, which included the hit song "All The Way To Heaven". In 1988, ''[[The World's Greatest Entertainer]]'' was released, featuring the song "Keep Risin' To The Top", which was named after [[Keni Burke]]'s then-obscure 1981 hit "Rising To The Top" (which has since become Burke's signature song). Doug E. Fresh's "Keep Risin' To The Top" also samples the main chorus of [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave's]] 1976 classic "Ain't No Half Steppin'," which [[Big Daddy Kane]] also sampled that same year for his song of the same name.

In 1992, after a four-year hiatus, Fresh joined [[MC Hammer]]'s label [[Bust It Records]] and issued the album ''[[Doin' What I Gotta Do]]'', a commercial failure despite some minor acclaim for the single "Bustin' Out (On Funk)", which sampled [[Rick James]]'s 1979 single "Bustin' Out".

In 1993, Fresh found a new home at [[Island Records]]-affiliated label [[Gee Street Records|Gee Street]]. However, he only released one single containing three songs: "I-ight (Alright)" (the main track), "Bounce" and "Freaks". Although "I-ight" (which originated the now-famous club chant "Heyyyyyy, YO!... I-iiiiight?") was slated to become the first major hit for Doug E. Fresh in five years, it was almost immediately overshadowed by "Freaks", a [[dancehall]] tune beatboxed entirely by Doug E. Fresh and vocalized mainly by his protégé, a Brooklyn-born Jamaican teenage newcomer named [[Vicious (rapper)|Vicious]]. The song received major radio and club play, followed by video play in early 1994. Vicious would soon ink a deal with [[Sony Music]]'s [[Epic Records]] for three years, although he would only release one album, ''[[Destination Brooklyn]]''.

In 1995, Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh reunited for a track on an album titled ''[[Play (Doug E. Fresh album)|Play]]'', which received positive reviews; Bret Love wrote, "A welcome flashback to the days when guns, drugs, sex, and violence were not the genre's primary lyrical focus."<ref>{{cite web|first=Bret |last=Love |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/play-mw0000175377 |title=Play - Doug E. Fresh &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2014-07-17}}</ref> Also on the ''[[Play (Doug E. Fresh album)|Play]]'' album was "Freak It Out", which featured [[Uncle Luke]], was produced by platinum producer [[Frankie Cutlass]] and appeared on the ''[[Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood]]'' soundtrack. ''Play'' was certified gold by the [[RIAA]].

===Post Play (2007–present)===
On May 23, 2007, he performed variations on "The Show" with finalist [[Blake Lewis]] on the [[American Idol (season 6)|sixth-season]] finale of ''[[American Idol]]'', the first ever hip-hop performance on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeDg16PPko0  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/zeDg16PPko0| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=Blake Lewis & Doug E.

In 2010, Fresh resurfaced when rap group [[Cali Swag District]] brought back some of his trademark dance moves for their song "[[Teach Me How to Dougie]]." Members of Cali Swag District saw [[Texas]] college students doing a local dance created in [[Dallas]] called the "D-Town Boogie".  They recognized it as a modified version of Fresh's dance moves and created a song that would feature the dance and would also give Fresh his due credit.

On June 27, 2010,  Fresh performed with Cali Swag District on "Teach Me How to Dougie" at the [[BET Awards]] pre-show. He also performed a concert called "The Show" at the Paradise Theater on August 12, 2010. On November 8, 2010, Fresh appeared at the [[Soul Train Awards]], where he taught CNN anchor [[Wolf Blitzer]] how to [[Dougie]] on stage as part of the show. On December 10, 2010, Fresh appeared on ''[[ESPN First Take]]'' to speak about the phenomenon of the Dougie as a sports celebration and voted on the best sports-related Dougie dances, selecting that of host [[Skip Bayless]], though he rated Wolf Blitzer's Dougie at the Soul Train Awards as better but with no sports association.

On October 28, 2011, Fresh performed at the Paradise Theater in a concert to benefit New York City's public hospitals; the show was part of "STAT! for NYC's Public Hospitals" to raise funds to reduce gun violence. On July 9, 2012, Fresh served as a celebrity judge on the Apollo Live TV show. Beginning May 25, 2013, Fresh hosted a classic hip-hop and R&B show called "The Show" on New York's 107.5 [[WBLS]], which aired 9:00-11:00&nbsp;p.m. Saturday nights until the final broadcast on December 31, 2016.

Fresh served as a guest mentor to [[Jeff Dye]] and [[Joe Jonas]], and performed with them, on the show ''[[I Can Do That (U.S. TV series)|I Can Do That]]'' on June 30, 2015.

In April 2007, a storefront for Doug E.'s Chicken and Waffles appeared at the corner of 132nd Street and [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.|Adam Clayton Powell]] Boulevard in Harlem.

==Legal issues==
On December 1, 2020, prosecutors from the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York Federal Court]] declared a warrant for the arrest of Casanova who they alleged was a leader within the Untouchable Gorilla Stone Nation Gang. He was among 18 alleged members of the Untouchable Gorilla Stone Nation Gang charged in connection with various racketeering, murder, narcotics, firearms and fraud offenses, officials said. The Acting U.S. Attorney [[Audrey Strauss]] said: "As alleged in the Indictment, members of Gorilla Stone committed terrible acts of violence, trafficked in narcotics, and even engaged in brazen fraud by exploiting benefits programs meant to provide assistance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic". The FBI apprehended 17 of the gang members, but Casanova was not detained and an arrest warrant was issued for him.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-02|title=Rapper Casanova wanted by FBI; another alleged gang member charged with teen's death in NY|url=https://www.pix11.com/news/local-news/rapper-casanova-wanted-by-fbi-another-alleged-gang-member-charged-with-teens-death-in-ny|access-date=2020-12-02|website=WPIX}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bloom|first=Madison|title=Casanova Facing Federal Racketeering Charges|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/casanova-facing-federal-racketeering-charges/|access-date=2020-12-02|website=Pitchfork}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-01|title=18 Members Of The "Untouchable Gorilla Stone Nation" Gang Charged With Racketeering, Murder, Narcotics, Firearms, And Fraud Offenses|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/18-members-untouchable-gorilla-stone-nation-gang-charged-racketeering-murder-narcotics|access-date=2020-12-02|website=www.justice.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=December 1, 2020|first=Aleia |last=Woods|title=Casanova Wanted by FBI, Charged With Racketeering and More|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/casanova-wanted-fbi-racketeering-charge/|access-date=2020-12-02|website=XXL Mag}}</ref> On December 2, 2020, Casanova surrendered to federal authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Casanova Surrenders to Authorities After Racketeering Indictment|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2020/12/casanova-surrenders-to-authorities-after-racketeering-indictment|access-date=2020-12-03|website=Complex}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Annese|first=Rocco Parascandola, John|title=Rapper Casanova surrenders to authorities after he's indicted in 'Untouchable Gorilla Stone Nation' gang takedown|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-casanova-rapper-surrenders-gang-indictment-20201203-isnxkjdk4vb3rkd4t4udrx6erm-story.html|access-date=2020-12-03|website=nydailynews.com}}</ref> On June 27, 2023, he was sentenced to 188 months (15 years, 8 months) in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Callas|first=Brad|title=Casanova Sentenced to Over 15 Years in Prison for Racketeering and Narcotics Charges|url=https://www.complex.com/music/a/brad-callas/casanova-prison-15-year-sentence-racketeering-narcotics-charges|access-date=June 27, 2023|website=Complex}}</ref>

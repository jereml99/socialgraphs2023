==Biography==

Delgado took on stage name Cuban Link and associated with fellow rappers [[Big Pun]] and Triple Seis in a group under the name Full-A-Clips.<ref name="MTV">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/cuban_link/artist.jhtml#bio|title=Cuban Link - Full Biography|publisher=MTV|access-date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>

After [[Fat Joe]] signed to [[Atlantic Records]] and launched [[Terror Squad Entertainment|Terror Squad Productions]] in 1997, he signed Big Pun, which lead to Cuban Link's affiliation with Terror Squad. Cuban Link and Big Pun both made guest performances on [[The Beatnuts]]' single "Off the Books" in 1997 and they joined Fat Joe's [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]] by 1998. Cuban Link contributed guest appearance vocals to Big Pun's April 1998 debut album, ''[[Capital Punishment (Big Pun album)|Capital Punishment]]'', on the song "Glamour Life". Following this appearance, Cuban Link was signed to Atlantic and Terror Squad and contributed guest appearance vocals to Fat Joe's September 1998 album [[Don Cartagena]] on the songs "Bet Ya Man Can't (Triz)", "The Hidden Hand", and "Terror Squadians". Link performed on the track "Tell Me What You Want" from Terror Squad's debut album, "The Album". After signing to Atlantic and Terror Squad, Cuban Link began recording his debut LP ''24K''. Big Pun died on February 7, 2000, so Cuban Link wrote and released "Flowers For The Dead" in Pun's honor. The album was scheduled to be released in the summer of 2000, however, without Pun's mediation, contract disputes between Fat Joe and Cuban Link and leaks prevented the release of ''24K''. 24K is now available for digital download on Amazon Music, but has not been released physically. 

In April 2001, during an album release party for [[Angie Martinez]] at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe, Cuban Link got in an altercation and had his face slashed when he was trying to break up a fight between Fat Joe and rapper Sunkiss. By that time, Cuban Link left Terror Squad. He released a mixtape, ''Broken Chains'', in 2003 put together by Dren Starr & Roy P. Perez.<ref name="Mixtape Mondays">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459811/20030203/cuban_link.jhtml|title=Cuban Link|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|date=February 3, 2003|work=Mixtape Mondays|publisher=MTV News|access-date=June 23, 2009}}</ref> He joined independent label Men of Business in 2005 and released ''Chain Reaction''. It included singles "Sugar Daddy" (featuring [[Mýa]]) and "Scandalous" (featuring [[Don Omar]]) and combined some [[reggaeton]] sound as well.

It was the largest independent deal ($2MM) for a single album and an unsigned act, at the time and a joint venture with Universal.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r787786|pure_url=yes}}|title=Chain Reaction > Overview|last=Gutierrez|first=Evan C.|date=August 16, 2005|publisher=allmusic|access-date=June 24, 2009}}</ref>

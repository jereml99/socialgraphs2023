'''Omar Gerryl Credle''' (born May 13, 1971), better known by his [[stage name]], '''O.C.''', is an American [[Hip Hop music|rapper]] and member of the group [[Diggin' in the Crates Crew|D.I.T.C.]] He has been involved with several [[underground hip hop]] groups, namely Crooklyn Dodgers '95, Luv NY, and Perestroika.

==History==

===Recording career===
Credle was born in [[Brooklyn]], May 13, 1971,<ref name="Bush">Bush, John "[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/oc-p45208/biography O.C. Biography]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved 2011-06-19</ref> and raised in the [[Bushwick]] section. O.C. cites legends like [[Kool G. Rap]], [[Rakim]], [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[Slick Rick]] as his main influences.<ref name="Halftimeonline">{{cite web|title=Hip Hop Icon Series: O.C.|url=http://halftimeonline.net/portfolio/o-c/|publisher=Halftimeonline.net|access-date=1 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420035522/http://halftimeonline.net/portfolio/o-c/|archive-date=20 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1991, he made his recording debut on [[Organized Konfusion]]'s "Fudge Pudge".<ref name="Bush" /> One year later he made an appearance on the remix of [[MC Serch]]'s "Back to the Grill" (which also features a very young [[Nas]]) after meeting Serch on the inaugural Source tour. Following the tour, O.C. signed with [[Wild Pitch Records]] in 1994 where Serch was vice president.<ref name="Halftimeonline" /> O.C. also met [[Lord Finesse]] and [[Buckwild (music producer)|Buckwild]] on the first Source tour, marking his introduction to the D.I.T.C crew. After the tour he connected with Buckwild and started recording a demo that would become his debut album ''[[Word...Life]]''.<ref name="Halftimeonline" />

By 1994, he finished the album ''[[Word...Life]]'', which included everything from his demo, along with "Time's Up," the song that would go on to be his most notable single. "Time's up" was initially a record for [[Pharoahe Monch]] from [[Organized Konfusion]].<ref name="Halftimeonline" /> Beyond a quick outro from [[Prince Po]], [[Word...Life]] does not have any guest appearances. This was not by design, however, as [[Nas]] was supposed to be on the album but never showed up to the studio for the recording session.<ref name="Halftimeonline" />

In 1997, O.C. signed to Pay Day Records,<ref name="Bush" /> where he released his second album ''[[Jewelz]]'', featuring collaborations with [[DJ Premier]], [[Da Beatminerz]] and [[Freddie Foxxx]]. The single "Far From Yours" peaked at #81 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], making it his highest-charting single to date. 
O.C. is also known for his feature on the ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]'' soundtrack as part of the [[Crooklyn Dodgers]], which also featured rappers [[Chubb Rock]] and [[Jeru the Damaja]] on the now classic [[DJ Premier]] produced "Return of the Crooklyn Dodgers". This is however the only time the group has ever collaborated.

''Ray's Cafe'' was released on Red Apples 45, a small label co-founded by A.G. and West. O.C. joined D.I.T.C. for their 2016 release ''Sessions'' which was preceded by the lead single "Rock Shyt".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2016/09/d-i-t-c-sessions-lp-rock-shyt-fat-joe-lord-finesse-diamond-d/|title=D.I.T.C.

'''Reginald Noble''' (born April 17, 1970), better known by his stage name '''Redman''', is an American rapper, DJ, record producer, and actor. He rose to fame in the early 1990s as an artist on the [[Def Jam]] label.

He is well known for his collaborations with his close friend [[Method Man]], as one-half of the rap duo [[Method Man & Redman]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2010/11/redman-clears-up-wu-tang-membership-confusion/ |title=Redman: "I Am Officially A Wu-Tang Member" |publisher=Xxlmag.Com |date=November 19, 2010 |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> including their starring roles in films and sitcoms which include ''How High'' and ''Method and Red''.  He was also a member of the [[Def Squad]] in the late 1990s.

==Early life==
Raised in [[Newark, New Jersey]], Redman attended Speedway Avenue School and 13th Avenue School before attending [[West Side High School (New Jersey)|West Side High School]], an experience he described as "off the hook".<ref>[http://streetleague.com/2013/08/21/the-spots-redmans-new-jersey/ "The Spots: Redman's New Jersey"], [[Street League Skateboarding]], August 21, 2013. Accessed November 11, 2019. "I went to Westside High. You know the East Side High in ''Lean On Me?'' I went to the Westside version. It was off the hook. I went to Speedway Avenue School. I went to 13th Avenue School."</ref>

In 1987, Redman was expelled from [[Montclair State University]] his freshman year due to poor academic performance at age 16. Having no other options, Redman then went back home to live with his mother, Darlene Noble, who eventually kicked him out of her house for selling [[cocaine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEvlrDSqLOk| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/KEvlrDSqLOk| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=Redman on Mom Kicking Him Out for Selling Coke, EPMD Putting Him On|date=July 26, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Two years later, at age 18, Redman was a young DJ-MC who went by the name "DJ Kut-Killa". He freestyled over funk and hip hop instrumental tracks on vinyl records in various parks and house parties around New York and New Jersey.

Redman was eventually discovered by [[Erick Sermon]] of [[EPMD]] while he was a DJ for [[Lords of the Underground]]. Sermon said when he met Redman for the first time, "I knew there was something spectacular about him. Right off the bat. The next day, we talked. And within the next two or three months, he moved to Long Island, to my crib. He moved right into my apartment."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopthebreaks.com/gems/redman-epmd-djing-lords-of-the-underground/|title=Hip-Hop Gem: Redman Met EPMD While DJing for Lords Of The Underground|website=Stop The Breaks {{!}} Independent Hip-Hop Promotion|language=en-US|access-date=March 31, 2016}}</ref> After moving in with Sermon, Redman went out on tour with EPMD. While on tour with the group he did everything from carrying their bags to coming out on stage and doing rap freestyles. In 1990, at an EPMD show in New York, Redman was invited onstage by Erick Sermon where he delivered a rap freestyle that changed his life. He freestyled a song describing himself as a rapper using every letter in the alphabet, from A to Z. After this, Redman was an official rap artist and began production with Erick Sermon on his first major label album, ''[[Whut? Thee Album]]''.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=282}}</ref>

==Music career==
===''Whut? Thee Album'' & ''Dare Iz a Darkside'' (1990–1995)===
In 1990, Redman made his official debut on [[EPMD]]'s album ''[[Business as Usual (EPMD album)|Business as Usual]]'', appearing on the tracks "Hardcore" and "Brothers on My Jock".

In 1992, Redman released his debut album, ''[[Whut? Thee Album]]'', which [[AllMusic]] noted for blending "reggae and funk influences" with a "terse, though fluid rap style".<ref name="allmusic">Wynn, Ron. [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p26106/biography|pure_url=yes}} Redman Biography], AllMusic. Accessed June 2, 2007</ref> The album peaked at number forty-nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]]. He was named "Rap Artist of the Year" by ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''. Redman followed this up with his 1994 album, ''[[Dare Iz a Darkside]]''. The first single, "[[Rockafella (song)|Rockafella]]", samples [[Leon Haywood]]'s "I Want'a Do Something Freaky to You" and [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]'s "[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]", two of the most sampled songs in hip hop. Redman's second album was notable for having most of the tracks produced by the artist himself (later on Redman would let other producers make most of his beats). During this time he used former mentor Erick Sermon to produce his records, including "Pick It Up" and "Whateva Man" from ''[[Muddy Waters (album)|Muddy Waters]]''.

In 1992, Redman appeared in [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s "[[Scenario (song)|Scenario]]" music video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/photos/full-clip-redman-runs-down-his-entire-catalogue|title=Full Clip: Redman Runs Down His Entire Catalogue|date=November 22, 2010|website=Vibe.com|language=en|access-date=October 12, 2019}}</ref>

===''Mixtapes, Collaborations & Production'' (2002–2006)===

===''Red Gone Wild'' (2007–2008)===
[[File:Redman at Rock the Bells 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Redman performing in 2008]]
In March 2007, Redman released ''[[Red Gone Wild]]'', produced by [[Chris Pinset|Chris Pinset.]] He stated on MySpace that the reason for the long wait to drop the album was the fast-changing pace of hip hop.
On March 27, 2007, Redman confirmed on BET's ''Rap City: Tha Bassment'' that the sequel to ''How High'', ''[[How High 2#Sequel|How High 2]]'', was currently being written. In an April 10, 2007, ''[[The A.V. Club|Onion A.V. Club]]'' interview,<ref>{{cite news|last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/redman |title=The A.V. Club |newspaper=The A.V. Club |date=April 10, 2007 |access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref> Redman hinted that there would be a second collaborative album with Method Man.

===''Blackout! 2'' & ''Reggie'' (2009–2010)===
''Blackout! 2'' was announced in 2007 by Redman and was originally scheduled for release in 2008, but its release was pushed back a number of times due to numerous reasons. In early 2008, a remake of the {{sic|hide=y|Smoothe}} da Hustler and Trigger tha Gambler classic ''Broken Language'' was released on the internet by the duo entitled ''Broken Language 2008'', fueling rumors of a ''Blackout!'' sequel coming soon. This rumor was further fueled by the duo while performing in [[Gainesville, Florida]], at the [[University of Florida]]. A ''[[Blackout! (Method Man & Redman album)|Blackout!]]'' LP was scheduled for a December 9, 2008, release but was recently pushed back to the first quarter of 2009. It was finally released on May 19, 2009. It debuted at number 7 on the ''Billboard'' 200, at number 2 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], at number 2 on the [[Top Rap Albums]] and digital in charted number 7 on the Digital Albums charts selling 63,000 copies in its first week.<ref>[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.9204/title.hip-hop-album-sales-the-week-ending-5-24-2009 Hip Hop Album Sales: The Week Ending 5/24/2009]. HipHopDX. Retrieved on May 24, 2009.</ref> The album also charted number 10 on the [[Canadian Albums Chart]]. The album has sold 160,375 copies in the United States by December 12, 2009, according to SoundScan.

In May 2009, Redman confirmed his next solo album would come out December 2009. The title for the project is ''Reggie Noble "0" 9½''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2dopeboyz.okayplayer.com/2009/05/05/redman-talks-ugk-blackout-2-method-man/|title=Redman Interview|access-date=May 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514090221/http://2dopeboyz.okayplayer.com/2009/05/05/redman-talks-ugk-blackout-2-method-man/#|archive-date=May 14, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The title of the album was then changed to just ''[[Redman Presents... Reggie]]'', and three singles ("Coc Back", "Oh My", and "Money on My Mind") were released. The first single "Coc Back" (which features Ready Roc) had music video filmed and released for it. But as it turns out, none of the tracks made the final cut of the album, only being promo singles. During an interview, Redman stated that Reggie Noble (Redman's own birth name), does the album, not Redman. Redman also said that there is going to be more, "poppish", type songs, rather his normal "rugged" and "hardcore" songs.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Kuperstein |first=Slava |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1435/title |title=Redman: Till I Collapse &#124; Rappers Talk Hip Hop Beef & Old School Hip Hop |magazine=HipHopDX |date=November 8, 2009 |access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref> After a few push backs, ''Redman Presents... Reggie'' was finally released on December 7, 2010. The first official single is "Def Jammable" and a video was released for the single. It has been confirmed that Redman will appear on a remix along with French rapper [[Soprano]] of "Tranne Te" by Italian rapper [[Fabri Fibra]].

==Personal life==

Redman was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], to Darlene and Eddie Noble. His sister Rosalyn Noble is rapper known as Roz. She has appeared on several Redman songs over the years.<ref name="allmusic"/> He is a cousin of rapper [[Tame One]].

In 2001, Redman appeared on an episode of ''[[MTV Cribs]]'' and showcased his [[Staten Island]] home which, in contrast to the luxurious homes usually featured in the series, was described by ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' magazine as "small and grimey". Speaking to ''Fresh Pair'', Redman explained that MTV had already picked out a few houses for him to make his appearance in, but Redman did not want to appear fake, and insisted the episode be aired at his actual residence. The TV crew had to be reduced to two people because that was the only number of people that could fit in his house.<ref name="cribs">{{cite web|url=https://hiphophero.com/the-real-story-behind-redman-and-his-mtv-cribs/|title=The real story behind Redman and his MTV Cribs|first=Isaac|last=Semple|date=December 2, 2022|website=hiphophero.com}}</ref>

The episode, which featured the crew having to pinch two wires together because the house lacked a [[doorbell]], and a cameo by Redman's cousin Mr. Cream (formerly known as Sugar Bear) sleeping on the floor in a comforter, has become "the most infamous, most cited" episode of the show according to MTV VP of programming Nina L.

He cites [[Jay-Z]] as one of his influences too.

==Personal life==
Joyner Lucas shares a son named Joyner Messiah Lucas (born February 20, 2016) with Carmen Julissa Ayala, with whom he had an off and on romantic relationship. Lucas tells the story of his son's conception in his song "Forever" on his mixtape ''508-507-2209''.<ref name=":4" /> Joyner Messiah Lucas is loved and adored by his father and referenced in many of his songs. He has also made cameos in his father's music videos. Most recently he played Will Smith's son [[Jaden Smith]] in the video of "Will".<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Lamarre |first1=Carl |title=Will Smith Can't Stop Watching Joyner Lucas' 'Will' Video: 'This Will Be My Ninth Time' |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9354405/will-smith-joyner-lucas-snapchat-video |magazine=Billboard |access-date=April 20, 2020 |archive-date=April 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200409054441/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9354405/will-smith-joyner-lucas-snapchat-video |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lucas has revealed that the title of his album ''ADHD'' comes from the fact that he was diagnosed with [[ADHD]] as a child. He explained that people surrounding him, including his own parents, made him feel like he was not normal and treated him differently as a result. Eventually, he would act out, bullying other classmates, failing classes, and get sent to an [[alternative school]] after expulsion.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joyner-lucas-announces-new-album-adhd-news.62031.html|title=Joyner Lucas Announces New Album "ADHD"|date=August 31, 2019|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=September 1, 2019|archive-date=September 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901020019/https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joyner-lucas-announces-new-album-adhd-news.62031.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/adhd-joyner-lucas-identity-crisis-or-art-imitating-life-news.90843.html|title=ADHD: Joyner Lucas' Identity Crisis Or Art Imitating Life?|website=HotNewHipHop|date=September 17, 2019|access-date=November 1, 2019|archive-date=November 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101234523/https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/adhd-joyner-lucas-identity-crisis-or-art-imitating-life-news.90843.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Feuds==

===Logic===
According to Lucas, when he was on [[Tech N9ne]]'s tour bus, he heard some records from Tech's album ''[[The Storm (Tech N9ne album)|The Storm]]''. Lucas expressed interest on collaborating with [[Logic (rapper)|Logic]] on the song "Sriracha" and felt that he could add to the display of fast-flow rapping, and Tech acquiesced.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2017/12/joyner-lucas-logic-beef-everyday-struggle|title=Joyner Lucas Goes Into Detail About His Issues With Logic|last=Diep|first=Eric|date=December 6, 2017|work=Complex|access-date=September 15, 2019|archive-date=May 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531170224/https://www.complex.com/music/2017/12/joyner-lucas-logic-beef-everyday-struggle|url-status=live}}</ref> Logic was originally slated to be the only feature on "Sriracha", but when he spent over six months to deliver his verse, Lucas hopped on the track to offer his own. Joyner stated that when they got the record back, he could tell that Logic was not "too happy" about him being on the track once he heard it.<ref name=":1" /> On his remix of [[Future (rapper)|Future]]'s "[[Mask Off]]", Joyner, unhappy by the work Logic turned in after taking nearly half a year to edit his verse, directly addressed the disappointing display. Both he and Tech N9ne were upset with Logic for not emulating the style of quick flow on the song.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/joyner-lucas-vs-logic-beef-a-timeline-news.46408.html|title=Joyner Lucas Vs.

After Logic's hit song "[[1-800-273-8255 (song)|1-800-273-8255]]" peaked at number three on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'', Joyner Lucas immediately took offense and argued that the track was named in order to bring direct competition to his song, "I'm Sorry" from his album ''508-507-2209''. In a later interview, he called Logic "corny"<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Joyner Lucas Interview on New Album '(508) 507-2209'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7948977/joyner-lucas-interview-508-507-2209-album-logic-diss-lyricism|date=August 29, 2017|magazine=Billboard|access-date=May 21, 2020|archive-date=December 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201202131902/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7948977/joyner-lucas-interview-508-507-2209-album-logic-diss-lyricism|url-status=live}}</ref> and in another incident, he said that he thinks that Logic "can rap" but feels like "he tries to prove that he's black too much for me."<ref name=":1" /> With both Logic's single and Lucas' mixtape dealing with the issue of mental health representation and resource allocation, Lucas was careful to not slam the track too hard.<ref name=":2" />

When Logic dropped his song "Yuck" from his mixtape ''[[Bobby Tarantino II]]'' in March 2018, the veiled diss inside the song was quickly spotted by Lucas and his fans, despite Logic saying that there was no diss in the song.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8262625/logic-denies-dissing-joyner-lucas-yuck-bobby-tarantino-ii-video|title=Logic Denies Dissing Joyner Lucas on ''Bobby Tarantino II'': "It's Not Who I Am"|date=March 27, 2018|magazine=Billboard|access-date=August 14, 2020|archive-date=November 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109103002/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8262625/logic-denies-dissing-joyner-lucas-yuck-bobby-tarantino-ii-video|url-status=live}}</ref> Seemingly nonplussed by the insult, Lucas dared Logic to call him out directly on [[Twitter]]. That same month, Joyner took aim at Logic's song "[[44 More]]" and his album ''[[Everybody (Logic album)|Everybody]]'' on his remix of [[BlocBoy JB]]'s "[[Look Alive (BlocBoy JB song)|Look Alive]]".<ref name=":2" />

In 2019, the two rappers ended their feud, which was revealed when Logic made a guest appearance on Joyner Lucas' song "[[ISIS (Joyner Lucas song)|ISIS]]", the third single from ''ADHD''. Lucas kept the name of the collaborator a secret until he released the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/05/joyner-lucas-logic-squash-beef-isis-new-song/|title=Joyner Lucas and Logic Squash Beef, Join Forces for New Song, Video "ISIS": Listen|last=Berry|first=Peter A.|website=XXL Mag|date=May 23, 2019 |language=en|access-date=September 15, 2019|archive-date=June 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608152934/https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/05/joyner-lucas-logic-squash-beef-isis-new-song/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Hopsin===
In September 2018, when a fan asked rapper [[Hopsin]] on [[Twitter]] who would win in a [[rap battle]] between him and Joyner Lucas, Hopsin replied, "That's a dumb question that I'm sure you already know the answer to." Not long after, Lucas commented, "Hold up. @Hopsin wtf is that supposed to mean???"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/09/hopsin-and-joyner-lucas-beefing|title=It Looks Like Hopsin and Joyner Lucas Are Beefing on Social Media|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=October 26, 2019|archive-date=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026202421/https://www.complex.com/music/2018/09/hopsin-and-joyner-lucas-beefing|url-status=live}}</ref> In his response, Hopsin stated that he would "b[r]eak his soul" and also dissed Logic in the comment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireboobookitty.com/2018/09/joyner-lucas-hopsin-beef-logic-gets-dragged/|title=Joyner Lucas Hopsin Beef - Logic Gets Dragged|last=LLC|first=Empire BBK|date=September 24, 2018|website=Empire BBK|language=en-US|access-date=October 26, 2019|archive-date=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026202429/https://www.empireboobookitty.com/2018/09/joyner-lucas-hopsin-beef-logic-gets-dragged/|url-status=live}}</ref> This dispute would prove to be short-lived, when in less than two days Hopsin shared a screenshot of a [[FaceTime]] call with Lucas, indicating that they finally made peace, but still wanted people to consider who would beat the other in a rap battle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48534/title.hopsin-joyner-lucas-exchange-twitter-smoke-they-need-more-people|title=Hopsin & Joyner Lucas Squash Their Twitter "Beef"|date=September 22, 2018|website=HipHopDX|access-date=October 26, 2019|archive-date=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026202419/https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48534/title.hopsin-joyner-lucas-exchange-twitter-smoke-they-need-more-people|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Tory Lanez===
On November 19, 2018, Lanez claimed that he was a better rapper than Joyner Lucas on an [[Instagram]] Live session. Incredulous, Lucas immediately responded by inviting Lanez to a battle rapping challenge and telling him to let the public decide who is better. The next day, Lanez dropped a freestyle over Eminem's "Lucky You", of which Lucas made a guest appearance on. In less than 24 hours, Joyner responded with his freestyle over "[[Litty]]" by [[Meek Mill]] featuring Tory Lanez, also targeting rapper [[Trippie Redd]], who joined Tory's Instagram Live and slandered Joyner's name as well. Shortly after, Lanez retaliated with his own freestyle of "Litty", titled "Litty Again", taking shots at Joyner's collaboration with Eminem. Lucas' [[answer song]] was a freestyle of [[Kodak Black]]'s "[[Zeze (song)|Zeze]]". On the track, he mentions Tory's being accused of plagiarism in 2016, when listeners noticed that the ending of Lanez's song "4am Flex" was similar to [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s "The Art of Peer Pressure". Joyner also accuses him of copying rapper [[Don Q (rapper)|Don Q]]'s flow on his 2017 Funkmaster Flex freestyle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hotawardhiphop.com/editorials-tory-lanez-joyner-lucas-lyrical-beef/|title=Editorials: Tory Lanez and Joyner Lucas Lyrical Beef|last=Hotawardhiphop|date=November 27, 2018|website=Hotawardhiphop Media|language=en-US|access-date=September 14, 2019|archive-date=March 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330082503/https://hotawardhiphop.com/editorials-tory-lanez-joyner-lucas-lyrical-beef/|url-status=live}}</ref> On November 23, Tory posted on Instagram a video of him declaring victory in the feud and celebrating. Displeased, Lucas reposted the video with his own comment, with a reference to Lanez as a singer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/tory-lanez-declares-victory-in-feud-with-joyner-lucas|title=Tory Lanez Declares Victory In Feud With Joyner Lucas|website=Genius|date=November 24, 2018 |language=en|access-date=September 14, 2019|archive-date=August 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190804024304/https://genius.com/a/tory-lanez-declares-victory-in-feud-with-joyner-lucas|url-status=live}}</ref>

The end of this rivalry was made public on August 8, 2019, when Joyner Lucas and Tory Lanez collaborated on their remix of "[[Suge (song)|Suge]]" by [[DaBaby]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-and-joyner-lucas-take-competition-to-the-court-news.89120.html|title=Tory Lanez & Joyner Lucas Take Competition To The Court|website=HotNewHipHop|date=August 26, 2019|access-date=September 14, 2019|archive-date=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826200858/https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-and-joyner-lucas-take-competition-to-the-court-news.89120.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

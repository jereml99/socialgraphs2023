'''David P. Hobbs''' (born September 23, 1963), also known by his stage name  '''Mr. Mixx''', is a co-founder of the controversial [[Hip hop music|rap]] group [[2 Live Crew]], along with being a [[Turntablism|scratch DJ]] and [[Record producer|music producer]] of the group. In 1986, the group released the single "Throw The 'D'"; it is now considered the blueprint of [[Miami bass]].

Later in 1986, 2 Live Crew released their debut album, ''[[The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are]].'' The album established the group's signature style of comical sexually explicit lyrics. After a slew of successful releases, the group met with considerable controversy as a [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida|U.S. district court]] ruled the album legally obscene. They were prosecuted but acquitted.

Hobbs produced popular 2 Live Crew singles such as "Throw the D", "[[Me So Horny]]", "Hoochie Mama", and other titles in the group's Miami bass musical catalog. Currently, Hobbs continues to DJ and produce other artists

== Early life ==
Hobbs was born on September 23, 1963, and raised in [[Santa Ana, California]].<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/07/mr-mixx-interview|title=2 Live Crew's DJ and Producer Mr. Mixx On the Roots of Miami Bass|last=Serwer|first=Jesse|date=July 7, 2016|website=www.redbullmusicacademy.com|publisher=Red Bull Music Academy|accessdate=August 3, 2019}}</ref>

In 1981, Hobbs graduated from [[Corona High School]] in nearby [[Corona, California]], and enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] shortly afterward.<ref name="auto" />

== Career ==
=== 1984:  Military service and founding of 2 Live Crew ===

In 1984, while stationed at [[March Air Force Base]] near [[Riverside, California]], Hobbs met fellow musicians and [[Airman#United States Air Force|United States Air Force Airmen]] Amazing Vee (Yuri Vielot) and [[Fresh Kid Ice]] (Christopher Wong Won).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/193064-Fresh-Kid-Ice |title=Fresh Kid Ice Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=August 22, 2014}}</ref> The trio, with Hobbs as [[disc jockey|DJ]] and Wong Won and Vielot as rappers, went on to form [[2 Live Crew]] and would perform in small venues near the base, eventually releasing the group's first singles "The Revelation" and "2 Live Beat Box", on their own label [[Independent record label|independent label]] Fresh Beat Records, that same year.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p50048|pure_url=yes}}|title=The 2 Live Crew: Biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|year=1999|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}</ref>

"The Revelation" and "2 Live Beat Box" became popular in [[Florida]], so much so that, following their discharge from the United States Air Force, Hobbs and Wong Won eventually relocated to [[Miami]] at the behest of local [[Tour promoter|concert promoter]] [[Luther Campbell]], who helped cultivate the momentum the group was establishing in the area. Hobbs DJing skills and prowess on the [[Roland TR-808|Roland 808 drum machine]] were instrumental in the group's overall growth.

=== 1985–1986:  Miami Bass DJ and 2 Live Crew success ===

In 1985, [[2 Live Crew]] released their follow up single, "What I Like" on Fresh Beat Records.  That same year, the group entered into a joint venture with [[Luther Campbell|Campbell]] and formed [[Luke Records|Luke Skyywalker Records]]. Shortly after forming the record label, Campbell joined 2 Live Crew as a [[hype man]].  In April, 1986, rapper [[Brother Marquis]] (Mark D. Ross) joined 2 Live Crew, replacing Vielot, who left the group shortly after its relocation to Miami .

In January 1987, 2 Live Crew released the [[Extended play|EP]] "Throw the D" with "Ghetto Bass" on the B-side, with Hobbs as [[Disc jockey|DJ]] and [[Record producer|producer]] on both tracks."Throw the D" became an influential  blueprint as to how future [[Miami bass]] songs were written and produced.<ref name="Bein2014">{{cite web|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/tootsie-rolls-hoochie-mamas-and-cars-that-go-boom-the-story-of-miami-bass|title=Tootsie Rolls, 'Hoochie Mamas,' and Cars That Go Boom: The Story of Miami Bass|last=Bein|first=Kat|date=November 3, 2014|website=thump.vice.com|publisher=VICE|access-date=February 27, 2017|quote=Miami Bass, Booty Bass, Booty Music, or whatever you want to call it, changed the scenes of hip hop, dance music, and pop forever...The story of music's dirtiest genre reaches back to the '80s with roots set firmly in Afrika Bambaataa's elektro-funk...foundational artists Amos Larkins and Maggotron, both of whom have been credited as kicking the regional sound into motion.

The reconfigured group, featuring their most well known lineup (Hobbs, [[Luther Campbell|Campbell]], [[Fresh Kid Ice|Wong Won]] and [[Brother Marquis|Ross]]) became popular locally and nationally with the release of their [[Music recording certification|Gold-certified]] debut album, ''[[The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are]]'' on January 25, 1987.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=2+LIVE+CREW&ti=THE+2+LIVE+CREW+IS+WHAT+WE+ARE|title=Gold & Platinum – RIAA|work=[[RIAA]]|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref>  Notorious for sexually explicit lyrics, the album made Hobbs and his bandmates rap superstars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thesource.com/2018/07/25/today-in-hip-hop-history-2-live-crew-dropped-their-debut-album-2-live-crew-is-what-we-are-32-years-ago/|title=Today In Hip Hop History: 2 Live Crew Dropped Their Debut Album '2 Live Crew Is What We Are' 32 Years Ago|last=Allah|first=Sha Be|date=2018-07-25|website=The Source|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-09}}</ref>

=== 1988–1991:  Continued 2 Live Crew success and attendant controversy ===

{{Main|2 Live Crew}}

In 1988, 2 Live Crew released their second album, ''[[Move Somethin' (album)|Move Somethin'<nowiki/>]]'' It was also certified Gold and featured the singles "Move Somethin'" and "Do Wah Diddy Diddy".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=2+LIVE+CREW&ti=MOVE+SOMETHIN'|title=Gold & Platinum – RIAA|work=[[RIAA]]|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> The album improved on the charts from the previous album, making in to #68 on the ''Billboard 200'' and #20 on the ''Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums'' charts.  A separate ”clean” version of the album, suitable for radio play, was released in addition to the explicit version.

[[2 Live Crew]]’s third album ''[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]]'' (1989), became the group’s most successful commercial studio album and was certified [[double Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album’s lead single "[[Me So Horny]]" peaked at 26 of the ''Billboard Top 100'' chart.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-2-live-crew|title=The 2 Live Crew Me So Horny Chart History|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2019-03-09}}</ref>  A clean version of the album, ''[[As Clean As They Wanna Be]]'' was released concurrently with the explicit version.

In 1990, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]] ruled  ''As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' to be legally [[obscene]], becoming the first album in history to be so declared by a [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal court]];<ref>''Skyywalker Records, Inc. v. Navarro'', 739 F.Supp. 578 (S.D. Fla. 1990).</ref> this ruling was later overturned by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]].<ref>''Luke Records, Inc. v.

In late 1990, following the verdict in the obscenity trial, 2 Live Crew released their fourth studio album, ''[[Banned in the U.S.A.]]''. The album included the hits "[[Do the Bart]]" and the title track which peaked at 20 on the ''Billboard Top 100'' chart.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-2-live-crew|title=The 2 Live Crew Banned In The U.S.A.

[[Bruce Springsteen]] granted the group permission to [[Interpolation (popular music)|interpolate]] his song "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]" for the single. ''Banned in the U.S.A.'' was also the first album to bear the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-standard [[Parental Advisory]] warning sticker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/does-parental-advisory-label-still-matter-tipper-gore-336329|title=Does the Parental Advisory Label Still Matter?|last1=Schonfeld|first1=Zach|website=[[Newsweek]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413195141/https://www.newsweek.com/does-parental-advisory-label-still-matter-tipper-gore-375607|archive-date=2019-04-13|url-status=|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref>

''[[Sports Weekend: As Nasty as They Wanna Be, Pt. 2]],'' featuring the single "[[Pop That Coochie]]," which reached 58 on the ''[[Hot 100]]'' chart, was released by 2 Live Crew in 1991.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-2-live-crew|title=The 2 Live Crew Pop That Coochie Chart History|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref> The group's sixth album was a sequel of sorts to ''[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]],'' and was also accompanied by a clean version, ''Sports Weekend: As Clean As They Wanna Be, Pt. 2.''

''Sports Weekend: As Nasty as They Wanna Be, Pt. 2'' would be the last studio album to include all of the most well known members of the group, Hobbs, [[Fresh Kid Ice|Wong Won]], [[Brother Marquis|Ross]], and [[Luther Campbell|Campbell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/wj84aw/remembering-fresh-kid-ice-a-pioneering-asian-rapper|title=Remembering Fresh Kid Ice, a Pioneering Asian Rapper|last1=Schwartz|first1=Zachary|last2=Horn|first2=Leslie|date=2017-07-14|website=Noisey|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408040744/https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/wj84aw/remembering-fresh-kid-ice-a-pioneering-asian-rapper|archive-date=2019-04-08|url-status=|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>

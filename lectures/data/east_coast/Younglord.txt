'''Richard "Younglord" Frierson''' (born July 9, 1978) is an American Grammy-nominated [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[R&B]] record producer.
In 2014, Frierson founded The Truth Licensing, a major provider of music for Films, TV shows, and commercial ads.

==Career==
A native of New York City, he was signed in November 1994, at the age of sixteen, to [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy's]] [[The Hitmen (production team)|Hitmen]] Production Team [http://www.younglordonline.com/yl-about.htm] producing for the label's roster including [[Mase]], [[The Lox]], [[Faith Evans]] and [[112 (band)|112]]. He has since produced for outside acts such as [[Virtue (musical group)|Virtue]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Lloyd Banks]], [[Veronica (singer)|Veronica]], New Edition and [[Consequence (rapper)|Consequence]]. Most recently his success was with the [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] comeback single "[[Come to Me (Diddy song)|Come to Me]]", which reached Number 9 on The U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100 Singles Sales]] co-produced by '''Yakubu "Jai" Izuagbe''' also known as '''Rebel'''.

===Frierson: The Talent Scout===
Frierson was also partly responsible for the now infamous producer [[Ryan Leslie]]'s meeting with [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]] after Leslie was given a 30-day contract as a music production intern for Frierson. When the two producers created the [[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles]] song "Keep Giving Your Love To Me" for the ''[[Bad Boys 2]]'' soundtrack, Ryan was asked to meet [[P. Diddy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanleslie.com/bio.htm|title=Ryan Leslie website.}}</ref>

Frierson conceptualized an incubator system for artists, allowing creative space for growth for up and coming artists and producers. Finding such talent such as Terry "MaddScientist" Thomas (a pseudonym inspired by [[Nicole Scherzinger]]'s single "{{Interlanguage link multi|Supervillain (song)|pl|3=Supervillain|lt=Supervillain|vertical-align=sup}}") and Atozzio, he helped guide and prepare them up to the point where they would be able to sign a publishing deal with [[EMI Music Publishing]].

Identifying and supporting burgeoning artists has been a crucial factor for Frierson. After speaking at lectures at [[Berklee College of Music]], Frierson met [[Keith Harris (The Black Eyed Peas)|Keith Harris]], guiding him to LA, where he eventually became Production Partner for [[Black Eyed Peas]]' [[Will I Am]], working on two of the last Black Eyed Peas albums, and also working on [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]'s hit single, "[[American Boy (Estelle song)|American Boy]]". [[Christopher "Deep" Henderson|Chris Henderson]], another talent under Frierson's wings, went on to write the hit record "[[Blame It]]" by [[Jamie Foxx]], and has written for R&B hit man [[R. Kelly]].

===License To Rock===
In 2014, Frierson founded The Truth Music Licensing [https://license2rock.com/services-1/]. The Truth controls a catalog of over 5,000 songs and has licensed music to major movie studios, networks, and high-profile brands.

License To Rock is the rebranding of The Truth Music Library. This rebranding consists of a major expansion and a partnership with a high profile music label. These changes put LTR in position to build a massive catalog and become a dominant force in the licensing space. Some of License To Rock's placements have been with Mona Scott's "[[Love & Hip Hop]]" franchises, [[Lee Daniels]]' "STAR" & "[[Empire (2015 TV series)|EMPIRE]]" and commercials for brands including Gatorade, Pepsi, and AT&T.

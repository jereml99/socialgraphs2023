With the absence of her father, Young M.A grew close to her brother, Kenneth Ramos, and her mother.

==Career==
===Music===
Young M.A raps about many of the same topics as male rappers, such as violence, sexuality, wealth, and acquisitions. She stated, "this industry is male-dominated, we can't pretend that it's not.

She stated that she feared her mother wouldn't accept her if she came out. In the interview, she said, "I used to be scared to tell my moms, though I knew my moms wasn't the type of mother to be like 'Oh, I don't like you' or 'I'm gonna ignore you,' but part of me still was scared."<ref name=":7" /> Young M.A also said in a different interview, "I was scared to express it to people who are close to me, That was me not accepting it yet, even though I knew deep down in my heart that I liked women."

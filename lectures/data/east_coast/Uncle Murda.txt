=== Shooting ===
On January 22, 2008, Uncle Murda was shot directly in the head while in a parked car on [[Linden Boulevard|Linden Blvd.]] in [[East New York]], but was not seriously hurt. Murda would later give contradictory accounts of the incident, saying he was only grazed by a bullet or hit by a piece of glass.  The shooting happened after the rapper released his mixtape entitled "Respect the Shooter". He discharged himself from the hospital less than 24 hours after he was admitted, with the bullet still in his skull. Uncle Murda called the nationally syndicated ''[[The Wendy Williams Experience]]'' radio show after the shooting and told her he was using "[[Hennessy]] and [[Newport (cigarette)|Newports]] to cope with the pain".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapbasement.com/news/roc-a-fella/uncle-murda-shot-in-the-head-using-hennessey-and-newports-for-pain.html |title=Uncle Murda Shot In The Head – Using Hennessey And Newports For Pain &#124; Roc A Fella |publisher=Rap Basement |date=January 24, 2008 |access-date=November 26, 2011}}</ref> No charges were filed, as Uncle Murda refused to cooperate with investigators, blaming the police for the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2008/01/25/uncle-murda-shot-in-the-head-blames-police/ |title=Uncle Murda Shot In The Head, Blames Police |publisher=BallerStatus.com |date=January 25, 2008 |access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref>

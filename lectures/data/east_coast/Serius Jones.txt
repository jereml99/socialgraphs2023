===Deal with Disturbing Tha Peace Records===
Serius Jones signed a record deal with rapper [[Ludacris]]'s [[Disturbing tha Peace]] record label in 2006 but 18 months later Serius and DTP parted ways. In an interview with HipHopDX.com,<ref name="hiphopdx">{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.8141/title.serius-jones-speaks-on-split-with-ludacris-new-deal|title=Serius Jones Speaks On Split With Ludacris, New Deal|date=23 November 2008|work=HipHopDX|access-date=23 August 2015}}</ref> Serius stated,

<blockquote>The hospitality in the beginning was really there. But I think after a while people just got annoyed of me, and sick of me. It's like, this gotdamn Serius Jones guy. He keeps going. He's not stopping and just settling in like everybody else. And it's like, no muthafucka I'm not stopping and allowing myself to be [content] with riding in the fuckin promo van. Like, nah B, this is rap star shit. Cause if it ain't, and if you ain't no fuckin rap star, you just some other little dusty rap nigga with a chain trying to be noticed. And that ain't never been my style. It's all love though, on my end, he said. I don't have nothing but good wishes for them. I wish them all the best. In terms of being people, in terms of character, I don't think they had any malice towards me. But it's a business.</blockquote>

Jones has also stated that:

<blockquote>
I heard stuff that supposedly I'm a head case, he said. I'm supposedly a diva. Like, I think my shit don't stink and all this. Look man, if anybody know me, and if anybody has followed anything about me, they know that I'm a humble dude with it when it comes to me not being on stage, when it comes to me not being a rapper. A star is supposed to shine [though]. [And] I'm not turning my shine off because people are uncomfortable about it. I can't do that. I can't afford to do that. I gotta feed people. I gotta eat and at the end of the day, I'm on a mission.</blockquote>

===''Life is Serius''===
Between 2006 and 2010, Jones produced and starred in a short autobiography film entitled ''Life is Serius'', directed by acclaimed Independent Filmmaker/Producer Winfield Ezell, Jr.  Jones also put out nearly 50 records, 100 music videos, short films, comedy sketches and an animated series "Day In The life" staying relevant online and in the blogs. Jones headlined a tour through Europe while filming a documentary of the experience entitled "The Euro Tour" and recording an album of the same name, including 2 music videos filmed in Rome.

=== 2011-present: Offer From Luxe Society Records, ''Living Legend'' and ''Legendary'' ===
Jones is released ''Serius Business 2'' on [[Thanksgiving]] in 2011. The EP features appearances by [[2 Chainz]], [[Gucci Mane]], [[T-Pain]], [[Bobby V]], Sam Scarfo, and [[Jay Rock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nahright.com/news/2011/11/25/serius-jones-serius-bizness-2-mixtape/|title=Serius Jones â€“ Serius Bizness 2 (Mixtape) - Nah Right|access-date=23 August 2015 |url-status=dead}}{{dead link|date=November 2022}}</ref>  In May 2012 Serius Jones was offered a deal with recently funded indie label Luxe Society Records. Nothing materialized from the offer and no music was ever released.

After a return to battle rap, Serius Jones will release his mixtape ''Living Legend'' on February 18, 2014, and follow up with his ''Legendary'' album in April of the same year. In conjunction with Serius Jones, the Jersey Mint Records, a New Jersey-based indie record label, was scheduled to release the album but the project was never released.

Since his battle rap return in 2012 to date (April 2017) Serius Jones is "arguably" undefeated, most recently battling Battle Rap star Dizaster on KOTD.

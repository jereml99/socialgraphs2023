He was initially exposed to hip hop at [[Bar Mitzvah]] dances, and when he heard the “funky beats in the background” of “old school bike videos” he would watch with his brother.<ref name="ugs">[http://ugsmag.com/2008/05/kosha-dillz/ "Kosha Dillz,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203163622/http://ugsmag.com/2008/05/kosha-dillz/ |date=2011-12-03 }} UGSMAG, May 30, 2008.</ref>

==Career==
Even-Esh started rapping at the age of 17. For several years beginning in 1999, he was heavily involved with the [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] [[battle rap]] scene at [[Nuyorican Poets Café]] in [[New York City]]. Other prominent participants were [[Mos Def]], [[Immortal Technique]] and [[C-Rayz Walz]].<ref name="Owen">Jaime Owen, [http://www.spinner.com/2010/03/03/sxsw-2010-kosha-dillz/ "Kosha Dillz Interview: SXSW 2010,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200701035526/http://www.spinner.com/2010/03/03/sxsw-2010-kosha-dillz/ |date=2020-07-01 }} [[Spinner (website)|Spinner.com]], March 3, 2010.</ref> That same year, he attended an [[MF Doom]] concert at [[The Wetlands Preserve|The Wetlands]], and recalls, "That’s when I knew I loved the underground hip hop scene. That show and Braggin' Rights at Nuyorican Poets Café changed my life for sure."<ref name="mtvU"/>

He originally went by Kosher Dill, saying, "I was [[Jewish]] and I wanted something cool." He changed his name to KD Flow when he was in the battle scene because he was "ashamed" of his MC name's Jewish association. After some substance abuse issues and a stint in jail, he became Kosha Dillz, coinciding with a decision to return to his Jewish identity.<ref name="Owen"/>

Kosha Dillz put out his first 12-inch, "Chainsaw Music," in 2005.<ref name="ugs"/> In 2006, he appeared alongside [[Matisyahu]] on the song "Childhood" off the [[C-Rayz Walz]] album ''The Dropping''. Two years later, C-Rayz contacted Kosha about collaborating.

He'll do goofball Russian dance kicks, crack jokes and single out individual audience members."<ref name="Weiss"/>

Kosha is influenced by [[Wu Tang Clan]], [[Mobb Deep]] and jazz artists such as [[Herb Alpert]].<ref name="mtvU"/> Growing up, he listened to [[Nas]], [[Notorious B.I.G.]], Wu Tang Clan, [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[Green Day]], [[Metallica]], [[Pantera]] and "music in Hebrew."<ref name="Owen"/>

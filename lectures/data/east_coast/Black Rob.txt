==Career==
Ross grew up in [[East Harlem]] and began rapping between the ages of 11 and 12.<ref name="unkut1">{{cite web|url=http://www.unkut.com/2013/02/black-rob-the-unkut-mini-interview|title=Black Rob, The Unkut Mini Interview, Part One|work=Unkut.com|date=February 28, 2013|access-date=February 16, 2017}}</ref> He was inspired by the artists he listened to regularly, including [[Spoonie Gee]], [[Doug E. Fresh]], and [[Slick Rick]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unkut.com/2015/04/black-rob-the-unkut-interview-volume-two/|title=Black Rob, The Unkut Mini Interview, Part Two|work=Unkut.com|date=April 13, 2015|access-date=February 16, 2017}}</ref> When he was 22, he joined his first rap group, the Schizophrenics, though they did not release any albums. He initially rapped under the alias "Bacardi Rob".<ref name="unkut1" />

He began associating with the [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]] label as early as 1996, appearing on the Bad Boy remix to [[112 (band)|112]]'s "Come See Me". He was then featured on several Bad Boy releases, including remixes to [[Total (band)|Total]]'s "What About Us" (1997) and [[Faith Evans]]'s "[[Love Like This (Faith Evans song)|Love Like This]]" (1998), the song "[[24 Hrs. to Live]]" (1997) from [[Mase]], and albums by [[Puff Daddy]] & the Bad Boy Family (1997) and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] (1999). He also made two appearances on [[Cru (group)|Cru]]'s 1997 album ''[[Da Dirty 30]]'', as well as albums by [[Channel Live]], [[Benzino]], [[Tony Touch]], and others. These guest appearances earned him media buzz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/black-rob-bad-boy-records-rapper-behind-whoa-dies-at-52/|title=Black Rob, Bad Boy Records Rapper Behind "Whoa!," Dies at 52|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 20, 2021 }}</ref>

In his earlier years, Black Rob headed the street rap team which he named "Alumni". His debut album ''[[Life Story (album)|Life Story]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.27150/title.black-rob-addresses-diddy-g-dep-sean-price-ny-rap-in-ama |title=Black Rob Addresses Diddy, G-Dep, Sean Price & NY Rap In AMA |work=Reddit.com |date=January 21, 2014}}</ref> was released in 1999 and rose above [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] sales. In early 2000, he released the hit single "[[Whoa! (Black Rob song)|Whoa!]]". Produced by [[Diggin' in the Crates Crew]] member [[Buckwild (music producer)|Buckwild]], "Whoa!" became his biggest hit. The song peaked at number 43<ref name="BillboardBlackRob" /> on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and reached the top 10 on both the R&B/Hip-Hop<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/288495/black-rob/chart?f=367|title=Black Rob Chart History: Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|magazine=Billboard|access-date=February 16, 2017|archive-date=February 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217073117/http://www.billboard.com/artist/288495/black-rob/chart?f=367|url-status=dead}}</ref> and Rap<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/288495/black-rob/chart?f=1222|title=Black Rob Chart History: Hot Rap Songs|magazine=Billboard|access-date=February 16, 2017|archive-date=February 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217073355/http://www.billboard.com/artist/288495/black-rob/chart?f=1222|url-status=dead}}</ref> charts. It was Rob's only solo single to reach the Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/rapper-black-rob-net-worth-at-time-of-death.html/|title=What Was Rapper Black Rob's Net Worth at the Time of His Death?|website=cheatsheet.com|date=April 18, 2021 }}</ref> Black Rob's verse in the song "By A Stranger", was featured in the in-game radio station "Game Radio" from ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Grand Theft Auto III - Game FM (No Commercials)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaktVddpM1I |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/TaktVddpM1I |archive-date=December 21, 2021 |url-status=live|language=en|access-date=May 16, 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Despite subsequently appearing on releases by [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]] and [[G. Dep]], he did not make another hit single. His second album, ''[[The Black Rob Report]]'' (2005) failed to perform as strongly as his debut and quickly fell off the ''Billboard'' 100 charts. In 2005, Jemal Mosley from Off The Block Entertainment started managing Black Rob's career. In 2010, he parted from Bad Boy and signed to independent label Duck Down Records.<ref>[http://www.sohh.com/2010/10/black_rob_ducks_down_from_bad_boy_record.html Black Rob Ducks Down From Bad Boy Records] SOHH.com</ref> In 2011, he released ''[[Game Tested, Streets Approved]]'', which peaked at number 44 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]]. Black Rob also started his own independent label, Box in One, with Jemal Mosley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/interview-with-black-rob/|title=Interview with Black Rob|website=aboveaveragehiphop.com}}</ref>

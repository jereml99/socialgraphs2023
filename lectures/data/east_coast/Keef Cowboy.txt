'''Robert Keith Wiggins''' (20 September 1960 – 8 September 1989), known by his stage names '''Keef Cowboy''' and '''Cowboy'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Keith Wiggins|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/802796|website=discogs.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref> was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artist and a member of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]]. He is widely credited as having invented the term "hip hop".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.hiphop/robert-keith-cowboy-wiggins/|title=Robert Keith "Cowboy" Wiggins|date=24 June 2019}}</ref>

==Life and career==
Wiggins was first recruited to MC for his friend [[Grandmaster Flash]] (then DJ Flash) by 1977.<ref>{{Citation |title=Simpson Street |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWvmsewKKdI |access-date=2023-03-12 |language=en}}</ref> He was a dancer and [[hype man]] for the band, and was a pioneer in the use of the [[call and response]] style to communicate with the audience. In 1983 he left the group and joined [[Melle Mel]], with whom he recorded the single "[[White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)]]", followed by the album ''[[Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five]]'' in 1985.

He has been credited with coining the term "hip hop"<ref>"Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame". ''[[Jet magazine|JET]]'' (April 2, 2007), pp. 36–37.</ref> in 1978 while teasing a friend who had just joined the [[United States Army]]. He did so by [[scat singing]] the made-up words "hip/hop/hip/hop" in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of marching soldiers. Cowboy later worked the "hip hop" cadence into his stage performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furious5.net/cowboy.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317071002/http://www.furious5.net/cowboy.htm |archivedate=March 17, 2006 |title=Keith Cowboy&nbsp;– The Real Mc Coy |date=March 17, 2006 |accessdate=April 8, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGsfXdMRS4c |title=Afrika Bambaataa talks about the roots of Hip Hop}}</ref>

He was addicted to cocaine in the last two years of his life and died of a drug overdose in 1989.{{r|sob}}

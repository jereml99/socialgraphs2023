'''Marvin Bernard''' (born March 31, 1978),<ref name="allmusic" /> better known by his stage name '''Tony Yayo''', is an American [[rapper]]. He was best known as a member of [[G-Unit]], a [[hip hop]] group he formed with his childhood friends, [[50 Cent]] and [[Lloyd Banks]]. Yayo released his debut, and to date, only studio album, ''[[Thoughts of a Predicate Felon]]'', on August 30, 2005, which debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

His stage name is derived from the 1983 film, ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', referencing the main character [[Tony Montana]], and Yayo, the slang word for [[cocaine]].

== Early life ==
Marvin Bernard was born on March 31, 1978, in [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]], a neighborhood in [[Queens]], one of the five [[Boroughs of New York City|boroughs]] of [[New York City]]. His parents were [[Haitian Americans|Haitian]] immigrants; he was the youngest of three children.<ref>Reid, Shaheem. (January 15, 2010) [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1629845/20100115/g_unit.jhtml Tony Yayo, DJ Whoo Kid, More Haitian Artists Discuss Earthquake – Music, Celebrity, Artist News]. MTV. Retrieved on 2011-07-31.</ref> At age fifteen, he dropped out of school in the tenth grade and dealt drugs to support his family. A year later, his parents divorced. As a child, he met his lifelong friends, [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[50 Cent]].

== Career ==
=== G-Unit ===
After his release from prison on drug charges,{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} the trio formed the group, [[G-Unit]], and began working on music together. The first underground mixtape featuring Bernard (who now went under the stage name Tony Yayo), was ''134 All Starz'', released in late 2000, referencing his old street he grew up on. However, G-Unit went on a hiatus after 50 Cent was shot nine times and released from [[Columbia Records]].{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} Two years later, G-Unit continued releasing a number of mixtapes in the early 2000s, including 2002's ''[[50 Cent is the Future]]'', ''[[No Mercy, No Fear]]'', and ''[[God's Plan (album)|God's Plan]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tony-yayo-mn0000157088|title=Tony Yayo – Biography, Albums, Streaming Links – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/tony-yayo-talks-about-life-g-unit-prison-wbna9258063|title=Tony Yayo talks about life in G-Unit, prison|website=Today.com|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref>

While Yayo was incarcerated in 2003, his comrade 50 Cent was granted his own record label, [[G-Unit Records]] after the success of his debut studio album ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'', which was released that February; Yayo appears on the album's track, "Like My Style". 50 immediately signed G-Unit members Yayo and Lloyd Banks to the label, and eventually [[Young Buck]] was signed and added to the group as the official fourth member; Buck was later retraced as Yayo's temporary replacement due to his incarceration.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} From 2003 to 2010, most of G-Unit's artists (including Yayo) were distributed by [[Interscope Records]]. G-Unit released their debut studio album, ''[[Beg for Mercy]]'', on November 14, 2003. It went on to sell over four million copies in the United States alone.<ref name="Beg for Mercy">Lamy, Jonathan (December 18, 2003).

Accessed July 18, 2007.</ref> The album was released during which time Yayo was still finishing a prison sentence on various charges, but he was still featured on the album and his face was also shown on the album cover. G-Unit's sophomore and final album, ''[[T·O·S (Terminate on Sight)|T.O.S: Terminate on Sight]]'', was released on July 31, 2008, and went on to sell 102,000 copies in its first week.<ref>{{Cite web |last=YoRapper |date=2008-07-09 |title=G-Unit's Terminate on Sight First Week Sales: Ouch! {{!}} Yorapper |url=https://www.yorapper.com/g-units-terminate-on-sight-first-week-sales-ouch/ |access-date=2023-02-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Due to issues between Yayo, 50 and Young Buck, G-Unit went under in 2014, but later reunited as a quintet with all original four members and a newly added [[Kidd Kidd]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Read XXL's Entire G-Unit Reunion Cover Story – XXL |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/entire-g-unit-reunion-cover-story/ |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=XXL Mag |language=en}}</ref> They only released two EPs, ''[[The Beauty of Independence]]'' (2014), and ''[[The Beast Is G Unit]]'' (2015), before 50 Cent publicly dissolved the group again in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marie |first=Erika |date=2022-08-12 |title=50 Cent Explains Why He Won't Do A G-Unit Reunion Project |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/424825-50-cent-explains-why-he-wont-do-a-g-unit-reunion-project-news |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=HotNewHipHop |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-08-13 |title=50 Cent Is Done 'Carrying' G-Unit, Says There Won't Be A Reunion Album |url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.72546/title.50-cent-tired-carrying-g-unit-lloyd-banks-tony-yayo-young-buck |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=HipHopDX |language=en}}</ref>

=== Solo career ===
[[File:2005 1104hoopsmania0016.JPG|thumb|right|Tony Yayo performing at Villanova Hoops Mania in 2005]]
His career as a rapper was halted by his ongoing jail sentence at the time throughout early 2003 until mid-2004. With Yayo incarcerated, G-Unit and close friend [[Eminem]] began a campaign called "Free Yayo". He said that he was unaware of the attention the campaign was getting until he saw Eminem wearing a "Free Yayo" shirt on stage at the [[45th Annual Grammy Awards|2003 Grammy Awards]], where he performed his [[8 Mile (film)|''8 Mile'']] theme song, "[[Lose Yourself]]".<ref>[http://www.xxlmag.com/magazine/2005/07/what-i-gotta-do/ What I Gotta Do].

Though his appearances on numerous mixtapes throughout his jail time announced his return on a street level, it was not until the release of [[Lloyd Banks]]' "Ain't No Click" and its parent album, ''[[The Hunger for More]]'' (2004), which featured Yayo that the latter received widespread recognition. His solo career hype was followed up by his debut single, "[[So Seductive]]" featuring 50 Cent,
On August 30, 2005, Tony Yayo released his debut studio album, ''[[Thoughts of a Predicate Felon]]'', debuting at number two on the [[Billboard 200]] behind [[Kanye West]]'s ''[[Late Registration]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyyayo.gunitworld.com.com/|title=Search|website=Tonyyayo.gunitworld.com.com|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |author=Billboard Staff |date=2005-09-07 |title=West 'Registers' No. 1 Album Debut |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/west-registers-no-1-album-debut-61537/ |access-date=2023-02-12 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref> He also appeared on the track, "Fake Love", which made its way to the [[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for 50 Cent's acting debut, [[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (film)|''Get Rich or Die Tryin''']], which released that November.

Since 2007, Tony Yayo has confirmed that work was in progress for his second studio album.<ref name="AHH">Steve Raze (November 5, 2007).

AllHipHop. Accessed November 6, 2007.</ref> As of 2023, the planned second album has not been released. In 2009, Yayo and Lloyd Banks were released from Interscope due to disagreements between the two members, 50 Cent and their former label's co-founder [[Jimmy Iovine]].

On May 20, 2010, Yayo released the single, "[[Pass the Patron]]", once again featuring 50 Cent. The single's release was distributed by G-Unit Records and [[EMI|EMI Music Distribution]] (which is now known today as [[Virgin Music Label & Artist Services]]). who will both promote and distribute the album.
On March 2, 2011, Yayo released another single called "[[Haters (Tony Yayo song)|Haters]]". The song features 50 Cent, [[Shawty Lo]] and [[Roscoe Dash]]. The single was released via the This Is 50 website after its premiere on [[WQHT|Hot 97]] by [[Funkmaster Flex]]. The single rapidly started to gain success on the urban radio charts and soon debuted on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|''Billboard'' Hot R&B/Hip-Hop song chart]] at number one-hundred-twelve.

=== Assault charge and dismissal (2007-08) ===
On March 24, 2007, Tony Yayo and childhood friend, Lowell Fletcher (alias Lodi Mack), were both arrested for the alleged simple assault on fourteen-year-old James Rosemond, Jr. (alias Lil Henchman), who is confirmed to be the son of Czar Entertainment founder and drug trafficker [[James Rosemond]] (alias Jimmy Henchman).

Tony Yayo made his first court appearance on the morning of April 25, 2007, in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]]. The case was adjourned to July 24. Yayo plead not guilty to all charges. His lawyer has expressed his belief that Yayo is innocent and commented on the situation in an interview with MTV:
{{blockquote|After a thorough investigation, I steadfastly and adamantly state to you that my client [Tony Yayo] did not slap anyone. I am hopeful that when [authorities] complete their investigation, they will come to the same conclusion.

A week before his court appearance, on April 18, the house of Yayo's mother was struck with bullets. The attack is believed to be in retaliation for his assault and to be ordered by Jimmy Henchman as vengeance for assaulting his son. Yayo references the attack on the G-Unit song, "Straight Outta Southside" (2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2007/04/20/home-of-tony-yayos-mother-sprayed-with-bullets/ |title=Home Of Tony Yayo's Mother Sprayed With Bullets |website=BallerStatus.com |date=April 20, 2007}}</ref>

Emerging from the [[underground hip hop]] scene in [[the Bronx]] borough of New York City in the early 1990s, he came to prominence upon being discovered by fellow Bronx rapper [[Fat Joe]], and made his earliest appearance on his 1995 album ''[[Jealous One's Envy]]''.

In 1997, Big Pun signed with Fat Joe's label, [[Terror Squad (record label)|Terror Squad Productions]] in conjunction with [[RCA Records|RCA]] and [[Loud Records]] as a solo artist. The same year, he released his [[41st Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy-nominated]] debut studio album ''[[Capital Punishment (Big Pun album)|Capital Punishment]]'' in April 1998 to critical acclaim and commercial success, peaking at #5 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and becoming the first solo hip hop record by a Latino artist to go [[RIAA certification|Platinum]].<ref name="RIAA"/>

==Early life==
Rios was born in [[The South Bronx]] in New York City to parents of [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] descent. He grew up in the [[Soundview, Bronx|Soundview]] neighborhood and had at least two sisters and one brother.<ref name="massappeal.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.massappeal.com/big-pun-widow-liza-rios-speaks-life-death-legacy/|title=It's So Hard: Big Pun's Widow Liza Rios Speaks on His Life, Death, and Legacy – Mass Appeal|date=April 3, 2015|access-date=November 22, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171201132133/https://massappeal.com/big-pun-widow-liza-rios-speaks-life-death-legacy/|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name= "Vibe 1998">{{Cite journal|last=Valdes|first=Mimi|title=Pound for Pound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JywEAAAAMBAJ|journal=Vibe|pages=108–111|date=August 1998| volume= 6| issue= 8|access-date=October 21, 2016|archive-date=December 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231152529/http://books.google.com/books?id=JywEAAAAMBAJ|url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="allmusic bio" /> He regularly played [[basketball]] and trained in [[boxing]].<ref name="massappeal.com"/>

He moved out of his mother's house at age 15 and was homeless for a period of time in the late 1980s.<ref name="uproxx.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.uproxx.com/music/life-and-death-big-pun/|title=The Rise And Fall of Big Pun |date=April 13, 2015|access-date=November 22, 2017|archive-date=December 1, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030749/http://uproxx.com/music/life-and-death-big-pun/|url-status=live}}</ref> Later, he received a large settlement from the city stemming from an incident in 1976, where Rios broke his leg while playing in a park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadpoetz.com/dead-rappers/rappers/big-pun.html| title= Big Pun| work= DeadPoetz.com |access-date=October 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081044/http://deadpoetz.com/dead-rappers/rappers/big-pun.html| archive-date= April 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Using his settlement money, Rios married his high school sweetheart, Liza, and the two moved into a home together.

Rios struggled with [[clinical depression|depression]] stemming from his turbulent childhood, and he coped with it by [[Emotional eating|overeating]]. Between the ages of 18 and 21, Rios' weight rocketed from {{cvt|180|lb}} to {{cvt|300|lb}}; he was consequently unable to tie his own shoes.<ref name="uproxx.com"/><ref name="massappeal.com"/>

==Career==
During the late 1980s, he began writing rap lyrics. He later formed the underground group Full-A-Clips with [[Cuban Link|Lyrical Assassin]], Joker Jamz and Toom. Rios made a number of recordings with the group in the 1990s, which have not been released. At this point Rios was operating under the alias Big Moon Dawg.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qE-LBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA332 |page=332 |title=Latin Music: Musicians, Genres, and Themes |last=Stavan |first=Ilan |date=July 29, 2014 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313343964 |access-date=February 20, 2015 |archive-date=March 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306123814/https://books.google.com/books?id=qE-LBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA332 |url-status=live }}</ref> After changing his stage name to Big Punisher, Rios met fellow Puerto Rican and Bronx rapper [[Fat Joe]] in 1995 and made his commercial debut on Fat Joe's second album, ''Jealous One's Envy'', in addition to appearing on the song, "Watch Out". He also appeared on [[The Beatnuts]]' song "Off the Books".

===''Capital Punishment'' (1997–1998)===

In 1997, Big Pun began recording songs for his debut album ''[[Capital Punishment (Big Pun album)|Capital Punishment]]''. In 1997, producer [[Knobody]]'s production partner Sean C took advantage of his new role as A&R at [[Loud Records]] to play Knobody's tracks to Big Pun.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeromeFoster.html |title=Interview With Knobody |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=September 27, 2005 |access-date=July 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217105316/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeromeFoster.html |archive-date=February 17, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Suitably impressed, the rapper hired Knobody to remix "[[I'm Not a Player]]".<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> The remixed song, featuring [[Joe (singer)|Joe]] and titled "[[Still Not a Player]]", became Big Pun's first major mainstream hit and major breakthrough for Knobody.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> The full-length debut ''Capital Punishment'' followed in 1998, and became the first album by a solo Latino rapper to go [[RIAA certification|platinum]],<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Big%20Pun&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=CertificationDate&perPage=50|title=Gold & Platinum – Big Pun|publisher=RIAA|access-date=August 15, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151606/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> peaking at No. 5 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''Capital Punishment'' was also nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album]].

===The Terror Squad collaboration album (1999–2000)===
Big Pun became a member of [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]], a New York-based group of rappers founded by [[Fat Joe]], with most of the roster supplied by the now-defunct Full-A-Clips who released their debut album ''[[The Album (Terror Squad album)|The Album]]'' in 1999. The album did not fare well commercially but it was well received critically and the album was meant to start the foundation for all other Terror Squad members to release their solo projects.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Health problems and death==
Rios struggled with weight issues his entire adult life. He weighed {{convert|180|lb|kg}} at age 18, which increased to {{convert|300|lb|kg}} at 21.<ref name="700 pounds">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/621074/big-punisher-weighed-700-pounds-had-enlarged-heart/|title=Big Punisher Weighed 700 Pounds, Had Enlarged Heart|publisher=SonicNet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000302012709/http://www.sonicnet.com/news/archive/story.jhtml?id=621074&pid=608518|date=February 8, 2000|archive-date=March 2, 2000|access-date=November 17, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> His weight fluctuated in the early 1990s between [[Obesity|obese]] and morbidly obese.<ref name="700 pounds"/> Rios enrolled in a weight-loss program at [[Duke University]] in 1999, and shed {{convert|80|lb|kg}}, but he prematurely quit the program and eventually regained the weight.<ref name="700 pounds"/> His weight was a constant topic of argument among him and his friends, to the point that Rios would not eat around them.<ref name="allmusic bio" /><ref name="700 pounds"/>

On February 5, 2000, Rios withdrew from a planned ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' performance with [[Fat Joe]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]] due to illness. Two days later while staying at a hotel with his family in [[White Plains, New York]], he suffered a heart attack and respiratory failure and was taken to a hospital, where he died at the age of 28 after paramedics were unable to revive him.

==Posthumous works and legacy==
Big Pun's second album, ''[[Yeeeah Baby]]'', completed after his death, was released in April 2000. It peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard charts and earned [[RIAA certification|gold record]] status within three months of its release. A [[List of works published posthumously|posthumous]] compilation album, ''[[Endangered Species (Big Pun album)|Endangered Species]]'', was released in April 2001. ''Endangered Species'' collected some of Pun's [[Greatest hits album|greatest hits]], previously unreleased material, numerous guest appearances, and remixed "greatest verses." As with his other albums, it also peaked in the top ten of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], reaching No. 7, but didn't sell as much as the previous Big Pun albums had. He collaborated with Fat Joe on ''Duets: The Final Chapter'', an album of tracks featuring [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], also deceased. The track "Get Your Grind On" begins with a Big Pun radio interview in which he said he would perform a duet with Biggie at the gates of [[heaven]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Juon|first=Steve|title=Notorious B.I.G: Duets: The Final Chapter|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2005_12_duets.html|work=RapReviews.com|date=December 20, 2005|access-date=December 20, 2008|archive-date=January 16, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116173550/http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2005_12_duets.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Pun was also featured on a track from the revived [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad's]] second album, ''[[True Story (Terror Squad album)|True Story]],'' on the track "Bring 'Em Back" with [[Big L]], another deceased rapper.

On May 2, 2001, the New York City Council stalled plans to rename a small portion of Rogers Place as a tribute, due to distaste over Big Pun's lyrics that "include[d] profanity and references to violence and drug dealing".<ref>{{cite news|last=Cardwell|first=Diane|title=Bronx: No Street For Big Pun|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/03/nyregion/metro-briefing-new-york-bronx-no-street-for-big-pun.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 2, 2001|access-date=December 20, 2008|archive-date=January 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102092147/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/03/nyregion/metro-briefing-new-york-bronx-no-street-for-big-pun.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

A second posthumous album was planned for release by Sony Music Entertainment in 2006 but was shelved due to a dispute with producer [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]], who owned the publishing rights to many of the intended album's tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/9320|title=Producer Delays Release of New Big Pun Album|first=Jolene|last=Petipas|date=July 5, 2006|publisher=SOHH.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717231630/http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/9320|archive-date=July 17, 2006|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref> In June 2005, Liza Rios put her husband's $100,000 custom Terror Squad medallion up for auction on [[eBay]], citing financial difficulties due to receiving no royalties from Pun's album sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sohh.com:80/articles/article.php/7265|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909193413/http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/7265|title=Big Pun's Terror Squad Medallion on Sale at eBay for Diddely|first=Carl|last=Cherry|work=SOHH.com|date=June 29, 2005|access-date=May 5, 2018|archive-date=September 9, 2006}}</ref>

On March 22, 2021, the intersection of East Fordham Rd and Grand Concourse in his native Bronx was named "Big Pun Plaza" in Pun's honor. A ceremony including family, friends, and local politicians preceded the street naming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/big-pun-honored-with-bronx-street-corner/|title=Big Pun Honored With Bronx Street Corner|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|first=Matthew|last=Ismael Ruiz|date=March 22, 2021|accessdate=March 27, 2021}}</ref>

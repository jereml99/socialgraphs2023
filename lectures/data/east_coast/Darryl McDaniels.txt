'''Darryl Matthews McDaniels''' (born May 31, 1964), better known by his stage name '''DMC''', is an American rapper. He is a founding member of the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Run-DMC]], and is considered one of the pioneers of [[hip hop]] culture.

==Early life==
McDaniels grew up in [[Hollis, Queens]].<ref name="EDM">{{cite web |title=From Music to Comics Run-D.M.C.'s Darryl McDaniels Is Still Our Superhero |url=https://edm.com/interviews/run-dmc-darryl-mcdaniels-comic-books-interview |website=EDM |access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref><ref name="VH1"/> He was born to an unwed mother who surrendered him to the [[New York Foundling]] home.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} He was a ward of the Foundling, in foster care, until placed with the McDaniels and eventually adopted by them.

McDaniels first became interested in hip hop music after listening to recordings of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]]. In 1978, McDaniels taught himself to DJ in the basement of his parents' home, using [[Turntablism|turntable]]s and a [[mixing console|mixer]] that he bought with his older brother, Alford, after having a comic book sale in their neighborhood.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLWsZ1cmG-k]. ''YouTube''. Retrieved July 11, 2019.</ref> During this period he adopted the stage name "'''Grandmaster Get High'''".<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/artist/300044/dmc/biography "DMC: Biography"]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Retrieved February 28, 2016.</ref>

==Career==
Later that year, McDaniels sold his DJ equipment, after his friend [[Joseph Simmons|Joseph "Run" Simmons]] acquired his own turntables and mixer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} After [[Jam-Master Jay]] – who had a reputation as the best young DJ in [[Hollis, Queens|Hollis]] – joined the group, Run encouraged McDaniels to rap rather than DJ. Gradually, McDaniels came to prefer rapping to mixing records, and adopted the nickname of "Easy D". In 1981, he dropped the "Easy D" moniker in favor of "DMcD", the way he signed his work in school, and then to the shorter "D.M.C.". This new nickname alternately stood for "Devastating Mic Control"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tnxied6epgiihh2frhideydlt5e?lyrics=1&pcampaignid=kp-lyrics|title=King of Rock – RUN-DMC|website=play.google.com}}</ref> or "Darryl Mac", his nickname since childhood as referenced in the lyrics of the song "King of Rock".

In 1984, the trio released their [[Run-D.M.C. (album)|self-titled]] debut album and became very successful in the hip-hop industry. The group's success continued to grow and reached its peak with their third album ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]''. The album went to No.&nbsp;6 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, making Run-D.M.C. the most popular hip-hop group at the time. During this time, McDaniels began to build a reputation as a heavy drinker. He was known to drink up to eight 40-ounce bottles of [[malt liquor]] a day and was arrested twice for [[public intoxication]] and [[driving while intoxicated]].<ref name="VH1" /> In 1987 Run-D.M.C. wrote "[[Christmas in Hollis]]" for ''A Very Special Christmas''. The music video for "Christmas in Hollis" was shot in Hollis, Queens. Run-D.M.C. filmed the video during their 1987 tour. DMC's mother made a guest appearance in the video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/we-talk-run-dmcs-christmas-in-hollis-with-dmc-hims-200603|title=We talk Run-DMC's "Christmas In Hollis" with DMC himself|date=December 10, 2013}}</ref>

In 1997, McDaniels began to develop a deep [[depression (mood)|depression]]. He became extremely unhappy with the rigorous routine of touring and performing, and with being away from his wife and newborn son. He began to rely heavily on [[prescription drug]]s and alcohol to ease the pain. While on tour, McDaniels noticed his voice was giving out. He was later diagnosed with [[spasmodic dysphonia]], a vocal disorder which causes involuntary spasms of the [[larynx]] muscles. He believes it was caused by the aggressive way in which he performs his lyrics compounded with the years of heavy drinking.<ref name="VH1">''DMC: My Adoption Journey''. [[VH1]].

[[File:D.M.C. 2011-12-11 02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|McDaniels performing with his backing band in 2011]]
Meanwhile, McDaniels began to have creative differences with his bandmates in Run-D.M.C., which by then, was well past its prime as a commercially successful hip-hop group. A longtime fan of artists such as [[The Beatles]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Harry Chapin]], McDaniels wanted to move towards a slower, softer sound which suited his now troubled voice. Run wanted to continue with the aggressive, [[hard rock]]-edged, sound that the group was known for. These disagreements caused McDaniels to sit out most of the recording of ''[[Crown Royal (album)|Crown Royal]]'' (2001).<ref name="VH1" /><ref name="angel" /> He appeared on only three songs.

Feeling depressed and suicidal, McDaniels heard fellow adoptee [[Sarah McLachlan]]'s song "[[Angel (Sarah McLachlan song)|Angel]]" (1997) on the radio. The song touched McDaniels so deeply that it inspired him to reassess his life and career. He credits McLachlan and her album ''[[Surfacing (album)|Surfacing]]'' (on which "Angel" appeared) with saving his life.<ref name="VH1" /><ref name="angel">{{cite web|title=DMC: Saved By An Angel – How Sarah McLachlan thwarted the legendary MC's suicidal tendencies.|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/691/691277p1.html|date=February 24, 2006|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=D., Spence|access-date=August 7, 2008|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025104607/http://music.ign.com/articles/691/691277p1.html|archive-date=October 25, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=The Moth Radio Hour|title=Darryl McDaniels on The Moth}}</ref> With a new outlook on life, McDaniels decided to write his autobiography. While researching his early years, his mother, Bannah, revealed a shocking secret: Darryl had been placed for adoption when he was three months old. According to Bannah, his birth mother was a woman of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] descent named Bernada Lovelace. He also learned that he was born in [[Harlem, Manhattan]], not [[Hollis, Queens]], as he had always believed. Even as a child, McDaniels knew he did not look like the rest of his family, and with the revelation, he finally understood why. The news inspired him to search for his birth mother. He began working with the [[VH1]] network on a documentary chronicling his quest.<ref name="VH1" /> His autobiography, ''King of Rock: Respect, Responsibility, and My Life with Run-DMC'', was released in January 2001.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In February 2006, VH1 premiered the documentary titled ''DMC: My Adoption Journey''. The program ends with McDaniels reuniting with his birth mother, who turned out to be named Berncenia and despite previous beliefs, was not, in fact, of Dominican descent. He thanks her for her choice because had he not been placed for adoption, [[Run-D.M.C.]] would have never existed. In March 2006, McDaniels released his solo album, ''[[Checks Thugs and Rock N Roll]]''. Produced and Music Directed by [[Romeo Antonio]]. The first single, "Just Like Me",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRtae4jTF4A|title=DMC Darryl McDaniels ft Sarah McLachlan - "Just Like Me"|last=OnTheNYCircuit|date=March 7, 2007|via=YouTube}}</ref> features an interpolation of Harry Chapin's "[[Cat's in the Cradle]]" (1974) performed by McDaniels' musical savior, Sarah McLachlan. During a recording session, McLachlan revealed to McDaniels that she, too, had been adopted.<ref name="VH1" /><ref name="angel" />

McDaniels also collaborated with Adoptee Zara Philips on "I'm Legit."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZbKNJUyGQ0|title=I'm Legit|last=TEST_ACCOUNT|date=January 17, 2010|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=I'm Legit|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TuPIC-1Rmo}}</ref> He testified before the New Jersey State Legislature in support of legislation to restore adopted adults' access to their original birth certificates. The legislation McDaniels supported was signed by Governor Chris Christie and became effective on January 1, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=NJ Adoptee Rights|url=http://www.nj-care.org/}}</ref> As a New York born adoptee, however, McDaniels did not have access to his own original birth record---he  hired a private investigator to help find his birth family in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/04/rapper_darryl_dmc_mcdaniels_an.html|title=Cleveland Plain Dealer|website=blog.cleveland.com}}</ref>

McDaniels had written the first draft of his autobiography before learning he was adopted and was working on a second solo album, working titled ''The Next Level''. Three tracks off the new album have been released{{when|date=September 2014}} ("Next Level", "Hip Hop", and "Beef Eater") and can be heard on his [[Myspace]] page.<ref>{{cite web|website=Myspace|url=http://www.myspace.com/dmc|title=Darryl McDaniels' Myspace page}}</ref>

In June 2007, McDaniels joined [[Aerosmith]] on stage at the Hard Rock Calling festival in London, England to perform "Walk This Way".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

McDaniels is featured in the video game ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]'' (2008) singing Run-D.M.C.'s singles "[[King of Rock]]" and "[[Walk This Way]]". He is also an unlockable guitarist in the game. In the game's trailer, it is revealed that McDaniels' son plays ''[[Guitar Hero (series)|Guitar Hero]]'' for hours each day.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In 2009, McDaniels performed in ''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian [[Howard Zinn]]'s nonfiction book ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'' (1980).<ref>{{cite web | title=The People Speak | url=http://www.thepeoplespeak.com/pages/credits/ | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713025528/http://www.thepeoplespeak.com/pages/credits/ | archive-date=July 13, 2010 | access-date=March 30, 2014}}</ref>

McDaniels' second solo album, the more rock oriented ''The Origins Of Block Music'', was due out in mid-2010 but was delayed. In December 2010, McDaniels appeared with [[Talib Kweli]], [[Mix Master Mike]], and [[Ahmet Zappa]] on a cover of [[Frank Zappa]]'s "[[Willie the Pimp]]" for ''[[The Frank Zappa AAAFNRAAAA Birthday Bundle 2010]]''.<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/frank-zappa-aaafnraaaa-birthday/id410582595 "The Frank Zappa Aaafnraaaa Birthday Bundle"].

[[File:11.6.14DarrylMcDanielsByLuigiNovi9.jpg|thumb|McDaniels signs copies of his comic book, ''DMC'' #1, at a November 6, 2014 appearance at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan.]]
In 2014, McDaniels ventured into the comics industry with his own publishing imprint, Darryl Makes Comics. McDaniels explains his lifelong love of the medium thus:
{{cquote|Growing up a mild-mannered, Catholic school kid, all I did was go to school and read comic books. I was strictly a [[Marvel Comics]] head; [[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]], [[Iron Man]], [[Captain America]], [[The Hulk]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], you name it. I loved Marvel because it was the city; it was all New York. The same backdrop I was living in<!--NOT a mistake--> in this universe was in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Comics did for me what hip hop did for me as I got older; it empowered me, inspired me and educated me. I learned about Nazis, space exploration, everything from comics.<ref>Newman, Jason (January 23, 2014).

Darryl Makes Comics' first book is ''DMC'', a 90-page anthology [[graphic novel]] set in 1985 that features McDaniels as a superhero who confronts both criminals and other superheroes whose recklessness threatens innocent lives.<ref>McDaniels, Darryl; [[Scott, Damion]] (w). Various artists (a). ''DMC'' #1 (October 2014). Darryl Makes Comics</ref> The comic's version of DMC wears McDaniels' signature [[Adidas]] sneakers, fedora and [[rope chain]], along with an elongated turtleneck that masks his face. The book is written by McDaniels and [[Damion Scott]], and edited by Darryl Makes Comics' Editor-in-Chief, [[Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez]] and Senior Editor [[Rigo "Riggs" Morales]]. Each chapter in the anthology is illustrated by a different artist, because, as McDaniels explained, " If DMC was really running around and bumped into four different people, they'd have four different descriptions of what he was like. We wanted each artist's work to relate to each character's view of DMC. If you saw him, you might say, "He came out of a spaceship and had all these things flying around him!" But then another dude is like, "No! He had a sword and shield!" We thought, if so many people saw something different in DMC, we'd have to have different artwork to represent their opinions on him or their interpretation on him." In addition, graffiti writers such as MARE 139 were hired to give the shots of 1985 New York City graffiti a sense of authenticity. The book features an introduction by [[Greg Pak]], a cover by [[Sal Buscema]] and [[Bob Wiacek]] and interior pinups by [[Carlos Pacheco]], [[Chris Burnham]], [[ChrisCross]], [[Dexter Vines]], and [[Shelby Robertson]], some of which are homages to iconic comics covers that influenced the creative staff as children. ''DMC'' debuted at the [[New York Comic Con]] October 9–12, and was subsequently released in comics shops October 29.<ref>Phegley, Kiel (September 3, 2014).

==Charity work==

'''The Felix Organization'''

In 2006, McDaniels and Sheila Jaffe, a fellow adoptee and Emmy award-winning casting director, co-founded The Felix Organization.

Since its inception, The Felix Organization has served more than 10,000 children in the foster care system. Its flagship program, Camp Felix, is an annual sleepaway summer camp in Putnam Valley, New York. Additionally, The Felix Organization sponsors two teen camps on the East Coast. Camp Felix West is for Los Angeles-based youth in foster care.

'''Other charity work'''

In September 2006, McDaniels received the Congressional [[Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute#Angels in Adoption|Angels in Adoption]] award for his work with children in foster care and promotion of adoption. He sits on the Board of Directors of Children's Rights, a national watchdog organization that reforms failing child welfare systems.

'''Trevor George Smith Jr.''' (born May 20, 1972), known professionally as '''Busta Rhymes''', is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer and actor. [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] gave him the moniker Busta Rhymes, after [[National Football League|NFL]] and [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] wide receiver [[Buster Rhymes|George "Buster" Rhymes]]. He has received 12 [[Grammy Award]] nominations for his work, making him [[Grammy Award records#Most nominations without winning|one of the most-nominated artists without winning]].

Busta Rhymes was an original member of [[Leaders of the New School]], a group that attracted national attention when they opened on tour for Public Enemy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.20399/title.busta-rhymes-reunites-on-stage-with-leaders-of-the-new-school|title=Busta Rhymes Reunites On Stage With Leaders of the New School|website=HipHopDX.com|access-date=September 11, 2017|archive-date=September 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911162050/http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.20399/title.busta-rhymes-reunites-on-stage-with-leaders-of-the-new-school|url-status=live}}</ref> He gained exposure for their guest appearance on [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s track "[[Scenario (song)|Scenario]]". Shortly thereafter, the group broke up, leading Rhymes to become a sought after solo artist, appearing on numerous tracks for other artists before his solo debut album, ''[[The Coming]]'' (1996). The album reached the top ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart, was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and earned him a [[Grammy]] nomination.

He has released ten total solo albums, with the most recent being 2020's ''[[Extinction Level Event 2: The Wrath of God]]''. Rhymes' list of hit singles include "[[Woo-Hah!! Got You All in Check]]", "[[It's a Party (Busta Rhymes song)|It's a Party]]", "[[Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See]]", "[[Dangerous (Busta Rhymes song)|Dangerous]]", [[Turn It Up (Remix)/Fire It Up|"Turn It Up" (Remix)/"Fire It Up"]], "[[Gimme Some More]]", "[[What's It Gonna Be?]]", "[[Pass the Courvoisier, Part II]]", "[[I Know What You Want]]" and "[[Touch It (Busta Rhymes song)|Touch It]]".

Among his other ventures, he founded the record label [[Conglomerate (record label)|Conglomerate]] (initially Flipmode Entertainment) and the production crew The Conglomerate (formerly Flipmode Squad). [[About.com]] included him on its list of the 50 Greatest [[Master of ceremonies#Hip hop|MCs]] of Our Time (1987–2007),<ref>{{cite web |date=January 26, 2012 |title=Top 50 MCs of Our Time: 1987 – 2007 – 50 Greatest Emcees of Our Time |url=http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top50Emcees_3.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309224616/http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top50Emcees_3.htm |archive-date=March 9, 2012 |access-date=March 30, 2012 |website=Rap.about.com}}</ref> while Steve Huey of [[AllMusic]] called him one of the best and most prolific rappers of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Huey |first=Steve |date=June 20, 2000 |title=Anarchy – Busta Rhymes |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/anarchy-r486345/review |access-date=March 30, 2012 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> In 2012, ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' placed him on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thesource.com/2012/06/22/thesourcepresentstop50lyricistspreview/|title=THE SOURCE PRESENTS: TOP 50 LYRICISTS (PREVIEW)|work=The Source|date=June 22, 2012|access-date=January 30, 2021}}</ref> [[MTV]] has called him "one of hip-hop's greatest visual artists".<ref>{{cite web |date=August 28, 2012 |title=Busta Rhymes' 'Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See' Inspired By Diddy, Q-Tip |url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2012/08/28/busta-rhymes-put-your-hands-where-my-eyes-could-see-inspired-by-diddy-q-tip/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901114945/http://rapfix.mtv.com/2012/08/28/busta-rhymes-put-your-hands-where-my-eyes-could-see-inspired-by-diddy-q-tip/ |archive-date=September 1, 2012 |access-date=December 24, 2012 |publisher=MTV}}</ref>

==Career==
===1986–1995: Leaders of the New School and rising popularity===
[[File:Busta rhymes-06-mika.jpg|thumb|upright|Busta Rhymes in 2002]]
In 1986, Smith, alongside fellow [[Long Island]] natives Charlie Brown (born Bryan Higgins), Dinco D (born James Jackson) and Cut Monitor Milo (born Sheldon Scott), formed the [[East Coast hip hop]] group [[Leaders of the New School]]. The group's big break was when they became an [[opening act]] for hip hop group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. Public Enemy's [[Chuck D]] gave Busta Rhymes and Charlie Brown their respective stage names.<ref name=ALLMUSIC>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000537548/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Biography]</ref> Leaders of the New School began recording in late 1990 and released their debut album ''[[A Future Without a Past...]]'' in 1991 on [[Elektra Records]]. In early 1992, the group appeared on [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s [[posse cut]] "[[Scenario (song)|Scenario]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Kevin|url=http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/017_03/6320|title=Unwrapping the Message|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026073417/http://bookforum.com/inprint/017_03/6320|archive-date=October 26, 2010|work=Bookforum|access-date=November 16, 2010}}</ref> In 1993, they released ''[[T.I.M.E. (The Inner Mind's Eye)]]''. Smith gained popularity from his advanced rhymes as well as his unique style that was not common of many New York rap artists at the time. Raised by two Jamaican parents, Smith embraced his heritage in his music and image as an artist. Smith was the only member of the group to wear dreads and use Jamaican slang, or patois, in his raps. Smith's unique style added an element to the group that allowed for rapid success. Soon after, however, internal problems arose because of his increasing popularity, and the group broke up on the set of ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mlynar|first1=Phillip|title=The Five Best Moments On Yo!

By the summer of 1992, Rhymes began making guest appearances on songs by several artists such as [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Another Bad Creation]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Brand Nubian]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and [[KRS-One]], as well on the interludes to [[Mary J. Blige]]'s debut ''[[What's the 411?]]'' and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] trio [[TLC (band)|TLC]]'s second album ''[[CrazySexyCool]]''. He also appeared on the album jacket of fellow hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest's ''[[Midnight Marauders]]'', with a host of other fellow hip-hop pioneers. In early 1993, he appeared in a cameo role in ''[[Who's the Man?]]'' with his fellow Leaders of the New School group members. That same year, he appeared as part of an [[ensemble cast]] in the [[Forest Whitaker]]-directed ''[[Strapped]]'' which also starred rapper and actor [[Fredro Starr|Fredro]] and [[Bokeem Woodbine]] and co-starred alongside [[Ice Cube]] and [[Omar Epps]] in the [[John Singleton]] film ''[[Higher Learning (film)|Higher Learning]]''.

In mid-1994, Rhymes continued to make guest appearances such as the single "[[Oh My God (A Tribe Called Quest song)|Oh My God]]" with [[A Tribe Called Quest]], he teamed up with [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Rampage (rapper)|Rampage]] and former classmate [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], on a remix to [[Craig Mack]]'s song "[[Flava in Ya Ear]]", soon after he would team up again with The Notorious B.I.G. with rappers such as [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]] and [[Coolio]] on a [[posse cut]], "[[The Points]]" which appeared on [[Panther (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] to the 1995 film ''[[Panther (film)|Panther]]''. At this time, Rhymes engaged in a [[freestyle rap|freestyle]] battle rap with [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], rapping the first few verses of his future breakout debut single "[[Woo-Hah!! Got You All in Check|Woo-Hah!!]]" in early 1995. Rhymes also worked on unreleased material with artists such as [[Nas]] and [[Mary J. Blige]]. Some or neither of the collaborations came to fruition, and Rhymes begun recording what would be [[The Coming|his debut studio album]] in late 1995.

===1995–1999: ''The Coming'', ''When Disaster Strikes'', and ''Extinction Level Event: The Final World Front''===
In the summer of 1995, Busta Rhymes began working on his solo debut album ''[[The Coming]]'', and a month after recording was completed, he released it in March 1996. A month before the album was released, he broke out with a hit single, "[[Woo Hah!! Got You All in Check]]". Later, he started work on his second album, ''[[When Disaster Strikes]]'', which would not be released until September 1997. It produced the hit singles "[[Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See]]" and "[[Turn It Up (Remix)/Fire It Up|Fire It Up]]". His musical journey saw him become one of the most successful and high net worth rappers in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famousnetworth.com/busta-rhymes-net-worth/|title=Busta Rhymes Net Worth|website=Famousnetworth.com|date=November 24, 2019}}{{Dead link|date=June 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 1998, Busta Rhymes recorded ''[[Extinction Level Event: The Final World Front]])''. Its lead single "[[Gimme Some More]]" — which sampled [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s theme from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' — reached No. 6 in the UK singles chart in January 1999. Busta Rhymes enjoyed further transatlantic success in April, when the single "[[What's It Gonna Be?!]]", featuring [[Janet Jackson]], reached the US and UK Top 11. The album received prominent notice for featuring the fastest [[rapping]] Busta Rhymes has performed, particularly on a song called "Iz They Wildin Wit Us?", featuring a guest appearance by [[Mystikal]].<ref name=ALLMUSIC-2>{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p61282/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|date=May 20, 1972 |access-date=September 6, 2010}}</ref>

That same year, the Flipmode Squad released [[The Imperial (Flipmode Squad album)|their group album]], and from there, they continued to collaborate.

===2000–2004: ''Anarchy'', ''Genesis'', and ''It Ain't Safe No More''===
[[File:Busta rhymes breaks it down for the mobile geeks.jpg|thumb|right|Busta Rhymes performing in 2006]]
{{See also|Flipmode Squad}}
In 2000, Busta Rhymes recorded his final album for Elektra, entitled ''[[Anarchy (Busta Rhymes album)|Anarchy]]''. After Busta signed to [[J Records]], a label started by the then recently ousted [[Arista Records]] chief and founder [[Clive Davis]], he released a greatest hits collection ''[[Total Devastation: The Best of Busta Rhymes]]'', alongside a new album of original work. Continuing the [[Bible|Biblical]] theme of his previous albums, he titled his record ''[[Genesis (Busta Rhymes album)|Genesis]]''. The album featured collaborations with [[Mary J. Blige]], [[P. Diddy]], [[Kelis]], and others. Genesis was powered by the hit single with Kelis, "What It Is", and his solo single released in November 2001, "[[Break Ya Neck]]". The final single was the summer smash "[[Pass the Courvoisier, Part II]]", which featured [[Pharrell]] and P. Diddy. Despite the success of the two singles, this album did not sell as well as previous releases. Fellow Flipmode members were featured, but minor changes in the roster were noted.

In 2002, Busta Rhymes released his sixth studio album ''[[It Ain't Safe No More]]''. The album was moderately successful, with a hit song featuring [[Mariah Carey]] and the Flipmode Squad titled "[[I Know What You Want]]". Another hit single was "[[Make It Clap]]", featuring [[Spliff Star]]. The [[remix]] of "Make It Clap", features [[Sean Paul]]. After its release, Busta Rhymes left [[J Records]]. In 2004, he signed with American record producer and record executive [[Dr. Dre]]'s [[Aftermath Entertainment]], through [[Interscope Records]]. Consequently, upon changing label, a new Flipmode album was cancelled and shelved. As a side note, Busta was also featured as a playable fighter in the 2004 fighting game ''[[Def Jam: Fight For NY]]''.

===2005–2009: ''The Big Bang'' and ''Back on My B.S.''===
His seventh studio album, titled ''[[The Big Bang (Busta Rhymes album)|The Big Bang]]'', became the first No. 1 album of his career. The album sold over 209,000 copies in its first week to earn the top spot on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-big-bang-mw0000569714|title=The Big Bang – Busta Rhymes – Songs, Reviews, Credits – AllMusic|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 5, 2017|archive-date=October 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006012854/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-big-bang-mw0000569714|url-status=live}}</ref> The album also became his highest-charting album in the UK, peaking at No. 19. Some of the album was previously [[Music leak|leaked online]], and as a result several songs were left off the album and new ones added. ''The Big Bang'' features production by Dr. Dre and [[Swizz Beatz]], as well as appearances by [[Raekwon]] and [[Nas]]. The album spawned the singles "[[Touch It (Busta Rhymes song)|Touch It]]", "[[I Love My Bitch]]", featuring [[Kelis]] and [[will.i.am]], "[[New York Shit]]", featuring Swizz Beatz and "[[In the Ghetto (Busta Rhymes song)|In The Ghetto]]". Busta Rhymes also had a stint opening for [[Mariah Carey]]'s [[The Adventures of Mimi Tour]]. Also, he has performed with [[Eminem]] on "Touch It Remix Part 5" and who also performed a verse on the aforementioned rapper's song, "I'll Hurt You". On July 17, 2008, Busta left Interscope and Aftermath due to a creative clash with Interscope head [[Jimmy Iovine]].

In 2007, Busta Rhymes released the song "[[We Made It (song)|We Made It]]" featuring [[Linkin Park]]. He also made an original song, "Where's My Money", for a fictional radio station in the 2008 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''. It was later revealed that Busta signed a deal with [[Universal Motown]], through which he released his eighth studio album ''[[Back on My B.S.]]'', on May 19, 2009.<ref name="universalmotown">{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2008/09/17/exclusive-busta-rhymes-signs-with-universal-motown/|title=Exclusive: Busta Rhymes Signs with Universal Motown|website=Rap-up.com|access-date=October 5, 2017|archive-date=September 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916010838/http://www.rap-up.com/2008/09/17/exclusive-busta-rhymes-signs-with-universal-motown/|url-status=live}}</ref> The album debuted at No. 5 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The album was supported by the singles "[[Arab Money]]", featuring [[Ron Browz]], "[[Hustler's Anthem '09]]", featuring [[T-Pain]] and "[[Respect My Conglomerate]]". The song "[[World Go Round]]", featuring British singer [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], was released in France on April 6, 2009, due to the heavy rotation of a leaked version. The single was released in the UK on July 13, 2009. Busta Rhymes also appeared on [[Asher Roth]]'s debut album ''[[Asleep in the Bread Aisle]]''.

Due to controversial content, the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) has banned the album. ''Back on My B.S.'' was released internationally, but because of one song, "[[Arab Money]]", it cannot be purchased as a CD there, although the album can still be purchased via [[iTunes]]. According to the National Media Council, the lyrics were considered to be offensive to Arabs and to Islam, because it quoted the [[Shahada]].

In November 2008, when "Arab Money" was released as a single, DJ Dany Neville and the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] rapper The Narcicyst responded by recording a reply. Rhymes later apologized. DJs in the country said they had not received an order banning the record from being spun in nightclubs, and they had mixed feelings on whether the record was offensive or not.<ref name="thenational.ae">{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090529/NATIONAL/705289848/1010 |title=Busta Rhymes album banned over track that quotes Quran – The National Newspaper |website=The National|location=Abu Dhabi |date=May 28, 2009 |access-date=September 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830101551/http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090529/NATIONAL/705289848/1010 |archive-date=August 30, 2010 }}</ref> DJ Saif of [[Dubai]] said, "I don't play 'Arab Money' because it's disrespectful [to] Arabs.

During an interview for [[Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes]], the rapper walked out when confronted with a question about [[LGBT representations in hip hop music|homophobia in the rap community]]. Rhymes is quoted as saying: "I can't partake in that conversation," followed by, "With all due respect, I ain't trying to offend nobody. . . We don't support abomination or un-natural stuff." When asked if the [[Hip hop (culture)|hip hop culture]] would ever accept a homosexual rapper, Busta Rhymes then exited the interview.<ref name="WashingtonPost1">{{cite news | last=Richards | first=Chris | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/19/AR2007021901224.html | title=A Hip-Hop Fan Hunts the Reason Behind the Rhyme | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2007-02-19 | access-date=2008-03-09}}</ref>

==Legal issues==

In December 1998, Rhymes was arrested and charged with possession of an unregistered gun after being pulled over during a routine traffic stop in New York City. In October 6, 2000, he received five years probation after pleading guilty earlier in the year.

On August 20, 2006, Rhymes was arrested and arraigned for charges of third-degree assault after attacking a man who reportedly spat on his car in New York City on August 12 after the [[AmsterJam]] Music Festival on [[Randall's Island]].<ref>{{Cite news|author=P-I staff, news services |title=People in the News: Busta Rhymes busted |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/people/281942_people21.html |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=August 21, 2006 |access-date=May 11, 2007}}</ref>

On October 24, 2006, Rhymes appeared at [[Manhattan]] Criminal Court as the [[district attorney]]'s office attempted to amend previous charges against him to include weapons possession for a [[machete]] found in his car. The judge refused to add the charge and adjourned the case.<ref name="NYTimes1">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/nyregion/25rap.html?_r=1&ref=nyregion&oref=slogin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 25, 2006 |title=Rappers Come and Go, Serving Justice and Their Fans |first=Anemona |last=Hartocollis |access-date=April 27, 2010 |archive-date=September 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904132636/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/nyregion/25rap.html?_r=1&ref=nyregion&oref=slogin |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="BostonHerald1">{{Cite news|url=http://thetrack.bostonherald.com/moreTrack/view.bg?articleid=183987 |title=Rapper Busta Rhymes considers judge's plea offer |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |date=February 20, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

On February 20, 2007, Rhymes refused a plea deal offered by the prosecutor's office for the assault of his former driver, Edward Hatchett.  The deal would have entailed six months in jail and [[guilty plea|pleading guilty]] to two assaults, the attack on Hatchett, and the attack on the former fan. The dispute with Hatchett is believed to have originated over back pay Hatchett felt he was owed. Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Becki Rowe offered Busta another option, pleading guilty to third-degree assault. The conditions of the proposed sentence would include five days of [[community service]], two weeks of youth lectures and six months of anger management classes, as well as three years of [[probation]].<ref name="BostonHerald1" /><ref name="CourtTV1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.courttv.com/people/2007/0220/busta_rhymes_ap.html |date=February 21, 2007 |title=Rapper Busta Rhymes considers plea deal for misdemeanor assault with no jail time |publisher=Court TV |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519032416/http://www.courttv.com/people/2007/0220/busta_rhymes_ap.html |archive-date=May 19, 2008 }}</ref>

On May 3, 2007, Rhymes was arrested in Manhattan for driving without a license and for driving while impaired. On March 18, 2008, a judge in New York City sentenced Rhymes to three years of probation, 10 days [[community service]], $1250 in fines (plus court costs), and to enroll in a drunken driving program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2008/03/18/woo-hah-judges-got-busta-all-in-check/|title=Woo Hah!

On September 25, 2008, Rhymes was temporarily refused entry to the UK due to "unresolved convictions".<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7635992.stm | title=Rapper Rhymes detained at airport | publisher=BBC | access-date=September 25, 2008 | date=September 25, 2008 | archive-date=September 26, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926171754/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7635992.stm | url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2018 Busta Rhymes was accused of plagiarism by Bernardo Lanzetti and his group, [[Acqua Fragile]], because in <nowiki>''Genesis'', the song that gives the title to his 2001 album, he used a sample of ''Cosmic mind affair'', taken from ''Mass Media Stars'', the group'</nowiki>s second album, without declaring it and indeed signing it in his own name.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-11-09 |title=Busta Rhymes, "Genesis" e l'accusa di plagio dagli italiani Acqua Fragile |url=https://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli/musica/2018/11/09/news/busta_rhymes_genesis_e_l_accusa_di_plagio_dagli_italiani_acqua_fragile-210862216/ |access-date=2023-09-10 |website=la Repubblica |language=it}}</ref> Lanzetti and the group decide to continue the cause;<ref>{{Cite web |title=Acqua Fragile e Busta Rhymes, il plagio mai riconosciuto - la Repubblica |url=https://amp-video.repubblica.it/amp/spettacoli-e-cultura/acqua-fragile-e-busta-rhymes-il-plagio-mai-riconosciuto/318930/319559 |access-date=2023-09-10 |website=amp-video.repubblica.it}}</ref> the usage of the sample is approximately 20.09 seconds and is repeated 4 times within Genesis for a usage percentage of approximately 35% of the total duration of the song.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Faremusic |first=Redazione |date=2020-11-12 |title=Bernardo Lanzetti, leader della band Acqua Fragile, contro i rapper americani: si torna a parlare di plagio |url=https://faremusic.it/2020/11/12/bernardo-lanzetti-leader-della-band-acqua-fragile-contro-i-rapper-americani-si-torna-a-parlare-di-plagio/ |access-date=2023-09-10 |website=FAREMUSIC |language=it-IT}}</ref> Furthermore, the name of the original producer of Cosmic mind affair, Claudio Fabi, also disappears from the rapper's album, because J Dilla is listed in this role in the credits.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-11-09 |title=Busta Rhymes, "Genesis" e l'accusa di plagio dagli italiani Acqua Fragile |url=https://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli/musica/2018/11/09/news/busta_rhymes_genesis_e_l_accusa_di_plagio_dagli_italiani_acqua_fragile-210862216/ |access-date=2023-09-10 |website=la Repubblica |language=it}}</ref> Since after years of negotiations the situation was not resolved with recognition, Lanzetti and the band decided to take legal action<ref>{{Cite web |last=Faremusic |first=Redazione |date=2020-11-12 |title=Bernardo Lanzetti, leader della band Acqua Fragile, contro i rapper americani: si torna a parlare di plagio |url=https://faremusic.it/2020/11/12/bernardo-lanzetti-leader-della-band-acqua-fragile-contro-i-rapper-americani-si-torna-a-parlare-di-plagio/ |access-date=2023-09-10 |website=FAREMUSIC |language=it-IT}}</ref>

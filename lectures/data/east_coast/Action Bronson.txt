In March 2016, the Program Board of the [[George Washington University]] announced that Bronson would be the headlining performer for the university's yearly spring concert, "Spring Fling". Controversy soon erupted as Bronson's song "Consensual Rape" came to light, as well as statements Bronson made that were considered [[homophobic]], [[transphobic]], and [[misogynistic]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kuruzius|first1=Rachel|title=GW Students Don't Want 'Blatant Misogynist' Action Bronson Headlining Spring Fling|url=http://dcist.com/2016/03/some_gw_students_dont_want_blatant.php|access-date=March 30, 2016|agency=The DCist|date=March 30, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053359/http://dcist.com/2016/03/some_gw_students_dont_want_blatant.php|archive-date=April 2, 2016}}</ref> Student activist groups successfully pushed for the university to cancel the performance.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blugis|first1=Sarah|title=Student leaders should not stay quiet about the Spring Fling headliner|url=http://blogs.gwhatchet.com/theforum/2016/03/29/student-leaders-should-not-stay-quiet-about-the-spring-fling-headliner/|access-date=March 30, 2016|agency=The GW Hatchet|date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> In April 2016, Bronson was similarly disinvited from the [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] Spring Weekend concert.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Megan|first1=Kathleen|title=Trinity Students Disinvite Controversial Rapper|url=http://www.courant.com/education/hc-trinity-disinvites-rapper-0422-20160421-story.html|access-date=April 22, 2016|agency=Hartford Courant|date=April 22, 2016}}</ref>

Bronson responded in an open letter, claiming that his songs "depict a story" and "aren't meant to be anything but an artistic expression," condemned all forms of sexual violence, and offered an apology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/64522-action-bronson-apologizes-for-behavior-seen-as-misogynist-and-transphobic-following-removal-from-college-concert/|title=Action Bronson Apologizes for Behavior Seen as Misogynist and Transphobic, Following Removal from College Concert |website=Pitchfork.com|date=March 31, 2016 }}</ref>

Action Bronson cites fellow American rappers [[Kool G Rap]], [[Nas]], [[Cam'ron]], [[Mobb Deep]], [[UGK]] and the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], as major influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/the-special-ingredient-action-bronson|title=The Special Ingredient: Action Bronson|work=Clash Magazine|date=January 4, 2013 |access-date=March 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.17388/title.action-bronson-responds-to-comparisons-with-ghostface-killah-other-white-rappers|title=Action Bronson Responds To Comparisons With Ghostface Killah, Other White Rappers|author=HipHopDX|date=October 26, 2011|work=HipHopDX|access-date=March 28, 2015}}</ref> Other artists include [[Michael Jackson]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] as well as Albanian wedding singers.<ref>{{Citation|last=GQ|title=Action Bronson Goes Undercover on Reddit, Twitter and YouTube {{!}} GQ|date=August 14, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBuLDy0Rw4E&index=53&list=WL|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref>

=== Rapping style ===

Early in his career, Bronson gained recognition for lyrically and stylistically resembling fellow New York rapper [[Ghostface Killah]] of Wu-Tang Clan (with whom he collaborated, along with friend and fellow rapper [[Termanology]], on a song called "Meteor Hammer", from the 2011 compilation album ''[[Legendary Weapons]]''). Ghostface Killah himself has admitted to confusing Bronson's rapping for his own.<ref>{{cite web|last1=k|first1=katie|date=May 21, 2015|title=Ghostface Killah Admits He Has Confused Action Bronson's Voice For His Own|url=http://www.pigeonsandplanes.com/2015/05/ghostface-killah-admits-he-has-confused-action-bronsons-voice-for-his-own/|publisher=Pigeons & Planes|access-date=May 22, 2015}}</ref> In a 2011 interview with [[HipHopDX]], Bronson was asked about how it was to be compared to the Wu-Tang rapper, and he responded with,
{{quote|Yeah, I mean at the end of the day, it's all good because Ghostface Killah is one of the best rappers alive, so if I sound similar to the best rapper alive then that is fine. To me there is no comparison; he is a legend and I am a newcomer. If I would try and emulate with anyone it would be [[Kool G Rap]], he is the person I look up to the most. I am not upset but at the end of the day I am my own person and no one can take that away from me.<ref name="dxnextaction">{{cite web|last=Tobias |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/dxnext/id.204/title.dxnext-action-bronson |title=DXnext: Action Bronson &#124; Check Out New Hip Hop Artists & Upcoming Rappers |publisher=HipHop DX |date=May 26, 2011 |access-date=August 17, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723025012/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/dxnext/id.204/title.dxnext-action-bronson| archive-date=July 23, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>}}

In mid-2020, prompted by having reached a body weight of {{convert|400|lbs|kg}}, and having a myriad of associated health problems, as well as by the birth of his son, Bronson began a regimen of healthier eating as well as [[boxing]] and [[high-intensity interval training]].

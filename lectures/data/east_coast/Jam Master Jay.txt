'''Jason William Mizell''' (January 21, 1965 – October 30, 2002), better known by his stage name '''Jam Master Jay''', was an American musician and DJ. He was the DJ of the influential [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Run-DMC]].

== Early life ==
Jason Mizell was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City,<ref name= mtvauto /> the son of Jesse Mizell and Connie Thompson Mizell<ref name= villiage /> (later Connie Mizell-Perry)<ref name="official foundation">{{cite web| url= http://jammasterjay.info/| website= jammasterjay.info| title= Jam Master Jay – Official Foundation| publisher= Jam Master Jay Foundation for Youth, Inc. | date= 2015| access-date= January 25, 2017}}</ref> whose other children are Marvin L. Thompson and Bonita Jones.<ref name= villiage />

At age three, Jason began playing trumpet. He learned to play bass, guitar, and drums. He performed at his church and in various bands prior to discovering [[turntablism]].<ref name= villiage /> After he and his family moved to [[Hollis, Queens]], New York City, in 1975 at the age of 10, he discovered the turntables and started DJing at the age of 13.<ref name= mtvauto /><ref name= villiage>{{cite news| url= http://www.villagevoice.com/news/jam-master-jay-19652002-6412061 |title= Jam Master Jay, 1965–2002| work= [[Village Voice]]| date= November 5, 2002| first= Harry | last= Allen | access-date= January 25, 2017}}</ref>  He was high school friends with [[DJ Hurricane|Wendell "DJ Hurricane" Fite]], known for his 13-year collaboration with [[The Beastie Boys]].<ref name=Owen2003 />

As a teenager, Mizell was involved with a group that committed residential [[burglaries]].<ref name=Owen2003 /> An encounter with an armed security guard frightened him into stopping the burglaries, and as an adult he was known for discouraging criminal activities among his friends and family.<ref name=Owen2003 />

For a time, he lived in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], where turntablism pioneer DJ Def Lou Hauck <ref name= mtvauto /><ref name=djtimes /> taught him to [[crossfade (audio engineering)|crossfade]].<ref name= mtvauto /><ref name=djtimes /> He caught on quickly because of his musical experience and after a year of DJing he felt that he was good enough to play in front of people.<ref name= mtvauto /><ref name= djtimes /> Originally calling himself Jazzy Jase, he attended high school at [[Andrew Jackson High School (Queens)|Andrew Jackson High School]] in New York City's Queens.<ref name= villiage />

== Career ==
He first started playing at parks and later played at bars. He also began throwing small parties around the area.<ref name=djtimes /> Once he got a pair of [[Technics SL-1200|Technics 1200s]], he improved rapidly, since he was able to practice at night with headphones on when he was supposed to be sleeping.<ref name=djtimes />

Mizell became a DJ because he "just wanted to be a part of the band".<ref name=djtimes>{{Cite web |url=http://www.djtimes.com/original/djmag/jun00/JamMasterJay.htm |title=Interview with ''DJ Times'', 2000 |access-date=February 8, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225094601/http://www.djtimes.com/original/djmag/jun00/JamMasterJay.htm |archive-date=February 25, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="cnn1">{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/10/31/obit.jam.master.jay/|title=CNN – Breaking News, Latest News and Videos|website=CNN|access-date=March 23, 2018}}</ref> Prior to joining Run-D.M.C., he played bass and drums in several [[garage bands]].

McDaniels]] just after they graduated from high school and agreed to DJ for them because he wanted to be part of the band.<ref name="mtvauto" /><ref name="cnn1" /> On Run-D.M.C's album ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]'', Mizell played keyboards, bass, and live drums in addition to his turntable work.<ref name="mtvauto">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/jam_master_jay/artist.jhtml|title=Jam Master Jay|website=mtv.com|access-date=March 23, 2018}}</ref> Mizell remained in his childhood neighborhood in Hollis, Queens his entire life.

In 1989, Mizell established [[Jam Master Jay Records]]. The label is most known for signing [[50 Cent]] and [[Onyx (band)|Onyx]]. Jam Master Jay Records folded after Jason Mizell was murdered on October 30, 2002.

Mizell's legacy includes the Scratch DJ Academy in [[Manhattan]]. Founded in 2002, the year of his death, the academy was created to "provide unparalleled education and access to the art form of the DJ and producer."<ref name="scratch">{{cite web|url=http://www.scratch.com/flash/index.html?flaPage=legacy|title=Scratch DJ Academy|website=scratch.com|access-date=March 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323205029/https://scratch.com/flash/index.html?flapage=legacy|archive-date=March 23, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2003, [[Kenneth McGriff]], a convicted drug dealer and longtime friend of [[Murder Inc. Records]] founders Irving "[[Irv Gotti]]" Lorenzo and his older brother Christopher, were investigated for targeting Mizell because the DJ defied an industry blacklist of rapper [[50 Cent]] that was imposed because of "[[Ghetto Qur'an (Forgive Me)|Ghetto Qu'ran]]", a song 50 Cent wrote about McGriff's drug history.<ref name=50cent>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/09/07/entertainment/main822172.shtml|title=Feds Lay Out Alleged 50 Cent Plot|website=CBS News|access-date=March 23, 2018}}</ref>

In December 2003, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine published an article by investigative journalist Frank Owen, "The Last Days of Jam Master Jay", which traced the murder to a drug deal gone bad.<ref name=Owen2003>Owen, Frank (2003). [https://web.archive.org/web/20130726024814/http://frankowen.net/golden-oldies/ The Last Days of Jam Master Jay], fxowen.com</ref> Owen said he uncovered evidence Mizell, not normally involved in crime as an adult, had turned to [[cocaine]] distribution to pay mounting bills. Mizell owed substantial debts to the [[Internal Revenue Service]], among others, after his music career stalled in the late 1990s. According to Owen, several sources indicated Mizell traveled to Washington, D.C., on July 31, 2002, to obtain {{convert|10|kg|lb}} of cocaine valued at about a quarter-million dollars from a trafficker known as "Uncle". Mizell reportedly agreed to pay for the drugs in about a week. However, Mizell failed to repay Uncle, who allegedly arranged to have Mizell murdered.

In April 2007, federal prosecutors named Ronald Washington as an accomplice in the murder.<ref name="msnbc">{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/18159877|title=Suspect named in '02 slaying of Jam Master Jay|date=April 17, 2007|website=Today.com|access-date=March 23, 2018|archive-date=September 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925123423/http://www.today.com/id/18159877|url-status=dead}}</ref> Washington also is a suspect in the 1995 murder of [[Stretch (rapper)|Randy "Stretch" Walker]], a former close associate of rapper [[Tupac Shakur]], who was also murdered.<ref name="msnbc" /> According to court papers filed by the prosecution, Washington allegedly "pointed his gun at those present in the studio, ordered them to get on the ground and provided cover for his associate to shoot and kill Jason Mizell." However, he was never convicted.<ref name="msnbc" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsone.com/1594265/unsolved-hip-hop-murders-rap/|title=The Top 5 Unsolved Hip-Hop Murders|date=October 24, 2011|website=newsone.com|access-date=March 23, 2018}}</ref>

In 2018, [[Netflix]] released a documentary analyzing the circumstances of his murder.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/netflix-remastered-trailer-who-killed-jam-master-jay-760981/|title=Netflix's 'Remastered': Watch Trailer for 'Who Killed Jam Master Jay?'|last=Reed|first=Ryan|date=November 28, 2018|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref> ''[[ReMastered: Who Killed Jam Master Jay?]]'', the third episode of Netflix's ''ReMastered'' music documentary series, interviews several of Mizell's friends, family members and acquaintances who share stories they have heard regarding suspects in his murder.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://decider.com/2018/12/14/remastered-who-killed-jam-master-jay-review/|title='ReMastered: Who Killed Jam Master Jay?' on Netflix Examines Murder Of Renowned Run-D.M.C.

She spoke to former Run DMC road manager Darren "Big D" Jordan, who denied allegations of involvement made against him by Ronald Washington. Clark further interviewed Owen, who stood by his 2003 article as largely accurate and stated he did not know who shot Mizell but believed the murder was facilitated by Mizell's close friend Ronald Washington.

=== 2020 arrests ===
In 2020, Ronald Washington and Karl Jordan Jr. were indicted for Mizell's murder. The indictment alleges that Mizell had recently acquired {{convert|10|kg|lb}} of cocaine from a distributor based in Maryland. Mizell, Washington, and Jordan had an agreement to sell the cocaine on consignment, but Mizell cut the two men out after a dispute.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Southall|first1=Ashley|last2=Rashbaum|first2=William K.|date=August 17, 2020|title=2 Are Arrested in Killing of Jam Master Jay, Hip-Hop Pioneer|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/nyregion/Jam-master-Jay-murder-arrests.html|access-date=August 17, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Washington had been considered a suspect very early in the investigation,<ref name="2007 timeline">{{cite news|last1=Kaufman|first1=Gil|title=Jam Master Jay's Murder: A Timeline And The Key Players|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1576088/20071207/jam_master_jay.jhtml|access-date=August 17, 2020|publisher=MTV News|date=December 7, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213002705/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1576088/20071207/jam_master_jay.jhtml|archive-date=December 13, 2007}}</ref> and Jordan had been charged in August 2003 with attempted murder after shooting Mizell's nephew, Rodney Jones, in the leg.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Reid |first1=Shaheem |title=Suspect Arrested In Shooting Of Jam Master Jay's Nephew |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1477088/suspect-arrested-in-shooting-of-jam-master-jays-nephew/ |access-date=August 17, 2020 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=August 20, 2003 |language=en |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030822050254/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1477088/08202003/run_dmc.jhtml |archive-date=August 22, 2003 }}</ref>

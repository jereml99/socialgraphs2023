'''John David Jackson''' (born November 18, 1977), better known by his stage name '''Fabolous''', is an American rapper. Raised in [[Brooklyn]], he first gained recognition while still a senior in high school, when he performed live on American music executive [[DJ Clue]]'s radio show, then on [[WQHT|Hot 97]]. Jackson subsequently signed to DJ Clue's [[Desert Storm Records|Desert Storm]] imprint, and later secured a distribution deal with major-label, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. Jackson gained prominence with his first release, ''[[Ghetto Fabolous]]'' (2001), which spawned the [[hit single]]s "[[Can't Deny It]]" (featuring [[Nate Dogg]]) and "[[Young'n (Holla Back)]]". His second release was 2003's ''[[Street Dreams (Fabolous album)|Street Dreams]]'', which was supported by two US [[Top 40|top 10]] singles, "[[Can't Let You Go]]" (featuring [[Lil' Mo]]) and "[[Into You (Fabolous song)|Into You]]" (featuring [[Tamia]] or [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]]).

Including the aforementioned songs, Jackson's series of hit singles extended throughout the 2000s, including "[[Street Dreams (Fabolous album)|Trade It All, Pt. 2]]" (featuring [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] and [[Jagged Edge (American group)|Jagged Edge]]), "[[Breathe (Fabolous song)|Breathe]]", "[[Make Me Better]]" (featuring [[Ne-Yo]]), "[[Baby Don't Go (Fabolous song)|Baby Don't Go]]" (featuring [[T-Pain]]), "[[Throw It in the Bag]]" (featuring [[The-Dream]]) and "[[You Be Killin' Em]]". He is also known for his appearances on several [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singles, including "[[Superwoman Pt. II]]" by [[Lil' Mo]], "[[Shawty Is a 10]]" by The-Dream, "[[Addiction (Ryan Leslie song)|Addiction]]" by [[Ryan Leslie]], "[[She Got Her Own]]" by [[Jamie Foxx]], and "[[Say Aah]]" by [[Trey Songz]], among others.

In 2004, Jackson signed to [[Atlantic Records]] (another subsidiary of [[Warner Music Group]]), after leaving Elektra, where he released ''[[Real Talk (Fabolous album)|Real Talk]]'', his first and only album under Atlantic. In 2006, Jackson was let out of his contract with Atlantic and officially signed with [[Def Jam Recordings]] (owned by Warner competitor [[Universal Music Group]]). Also in 2006, Jackson founded his own record label, Street Family Records. In 2007, he released ''[[From Nothin' to Somethin']]'', under Def Jam. In 2009, he released his fifth album, ''[[Loso's Way]]''. Throughout the years, Jackson has amassed a number of self-released [[mixtape]]s, including several installments of his highly acclaimed ''There Is No Competition'' series and ''The S.O.U.L. Tape'' series. He released his sixth album, ''[[The Young OG Project]]'', in 2014.

=== 2004–2008: ''Real Talk'' and ''From Nothin' to Somethin''' ===
[[File:Fabolous by Frank DeMaria.jpg|thumb|upright|right|240px|Fabolous at [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] in June 2007]]
Fabolous' third album ''[[Real Talk (Fabolous album)|Real Talk]]'' was released on November 5, 2004. It debuted at number six on the ''Billboard'' 200 with 179,000 copies and had two charting singles, the lowest in his career. The two charting singles are his street anthem "[[Breathe (Fabolous song)|Breathe]]" and "[[Baby (Fabolous song)|Baby]]," which features Mike Shorey, and shows his more sensitive side that he has shown on many songs in the past. His second single was not promoted until weeks after the album's release. "Tit 4 Tat" was his third single. [[Pharrell]] of [[The Neptunes]] produced it and did the hook. Fab feels that the single didn't hit it as big as it should have due to poor advertising. Making the music video for his fourth single, "Do the Damn Thing" cost Jackson $30,000. The song featured [[Young Jeezy]], who became known to the public through the video.<ref name=XXL>Golianopoulos, Thomas.

In 1979, Diamond co-founded the band [[The Young Aborigines]]. In 1981, [[Adam Yauch]], aka MCA, a friend and follower of the band, became their bass player, and on the suggestion of their then-guitar player, John Berry, the band changed their name to the Beastie Boys.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=59&csid2=9&fid1=3028 |title=More Rhymes Than Grey Hairs |publisher=[[Exclaim!]] |access-date=June 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714043519/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=59&csid2=9&fid1=3028 |archive-date=July 14, 2009}}</ref> By 1983, [[Ad-Rock|Adam Horovitz]] (Ad-Rock) joined, and their sound began to shift away from [[Punk rock|punk]] to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/artists/beastie-boys/biography |title=Beastie Boys Biography |publisher=[[Xfm London]] |access-date=June 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204224459/http://www.xfm.co.uk/artists/beastie-boys/biography |archive-date=December 4, 2008}}</ref>

In 1992, Diamond founded the Beastie Boys' now-defunct record label [[Grand Royal Records]].

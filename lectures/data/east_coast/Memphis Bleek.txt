==Music career==
Memphis Bleek was one of the first artists signed to [[Roc-A-Fella]], as a protégé of [[Jay-Z]]. He grew up in [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Marcy Houses|Marcy Projects]], located in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant]], the same neighborhood as Jay-Z. He appears on the Jay-Z albums: ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'', ''[[Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life]]'', ''[[Vol. 3… Life and Times of S. Carter]]'', ''[[The Dynasty: Roc La Familia]]'', and ''[[The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse]]''.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Jay-Z/e/B000APXF5M Jay-Z Album Discography | CDNow]. Amazon.com. Retrieved on January 26, 2013.</ref> Bleek's first official appearance was "Coming of Age" from ''Reasonable Doubt''. After the huge success of ''Hard Knock Life'' and the exposure of the Roc-A-Fella camp, (a Memphis Bleek track off the aforementioned Jay-Z album, "It's Alright", actually charted on Billboard), the label released Memphis Bleek's debut album, [[Coming of Age (Memphis Bleek album)|Coming of Age]]. The [[album]] was the week's Hot Shot Debut on the Billboard 200, peaking at #7 with 118,000 units sold in its first week.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=946856 The Boy are back Atop the Top 200]. Billboard.com. Retrieved on January 26, 2013.</ref>
The name "Memphis", which the rapper explained paid homage to pimps, was an acronym for "Making Easy Money, Pimping Hoes In Style" while "Bleek" had been a childhood nickname, given to him by his younger sister.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bleek, Memphis {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/bleek-memphis|access-date=May 1, 2015 |website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref>
He has released three more albums since his debut, ''[[The Understanding (Memphis Bleek album)|The Understanding]]'', ''[[M.A.D.E.]]'', and ''534'' (Out of the three, [[The Understanding (Memphis Bleek album)|The Understanding]] was certified Gold by the RIAA). In between the release of ''The Understanding'' and ''M.A.D.E.'', he took a three-year hiatus, in which time he took care of his older brother, who was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67814/hot-product M.A.D.E. in America]. Billboard. Retrieved on January 26, 2013.</ref> There are three significant notes to take away from the album ''534'', which was named after the [[house numbering|building number]] of the housing project, where he and Jay-Z grew up. First, it was the debut release from the "new" Roc-A-Fella, referring to Jay-Z becoming President of [[Def Jam]].<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/63220/memphis-bleek-brings-it-all-back-home Memphis Bleek Brings It All Back Home]. Billboard.com. Retrieved on January 26, 2013.</ref> It also contains the first official Def Jam recording by label mate turned international star, [[Rihanna]], who featured on the song "The One". And lastly, this album marks the time in which Jay-Z released his first song since beginning his brief "retirement" in late 2003. The song was called "[[Dear Summer]]", in reference to what Jay called the time of the year when he would drop a classic album or single every year for eight straight years, and how he had to metaphorically leave "her", Summer.<ref>Reid, Shaheem.

Memphis Bleek's highest charting single was "[[Is That Yo Chick]]", featuring [[Missy Elliott]] and Jay-Z, which peaked at #7 on the Hot Rap Singles ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Chart, and only one of two songs by the artist to crack the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #68, and the only track to appear on one of his solo albums. The other single being "It's Alright", appearing on the Hard Knock Life album by Jay-Z, peaking at #61 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=memphis bleek|chart=all}} Artist Chart History – Memphis Bleek | Billboard<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has had countless collaborations with fellow hip-hop artists such as [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Ja Rule]], [[T.I.]], and [[Trick Daddy]], with many of the features coming with other Roc-A-Fella artists, including [[Beanie Sigel]], [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]], [[Cam'ron]], [[Amil (rapper)|Amil]], [[Young Gunz]], and of course Jay-Z.

In fall 2005, Memphis Bleek told MTV that he was recording an album called ''[[The Process (Memphis Bleek album)|The Process]]'', that he would describe as a make or break album, saying "I want to do an album that's through the roof, I want to do a classic album. I feel that if this album I'm not recording is a classic, I'm not even gonna put it out. I have to do it bigger than anybody has ever done it. I have to make a good record this time, not just talking-junk records."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1521687/jay-zs-most-loyal-soldier-memphis-bleek-finally-has-his-own-desk/|title=Jay-Z's Most Loyal Soldier, Memphis Bleek, Finally Has His Own Desk |website=mtv.com}}</ref><ref>Reid, Shaheem.

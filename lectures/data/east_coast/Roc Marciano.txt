Freemusicempire named Roc Marciano as 2018 MVP. Dan-O commented "Our newly crowned FME MVP of 2018 released three albums this year. Each handled with a curators eye; three albums with a total of 36 songs which averages to 12 songs per album. Each one shading his story a different hue, taking a step further in creating a full landscape while maintaining a two fisted approach to punch lines that would have made prized pugilist Rocky Marciano proud."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freemusicempire.com/2018/12/19/freemusicempire-mvp-of-2018-is-roc-marciano|title=Freemusicempire MVP of 2018 is Roc Marciano|date=19 December 2018}}</ref>

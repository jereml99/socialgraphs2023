== Career ==
Irv Gotti, under the moniker ''DJ Irv'', produced the song ''Can I Live'' on [[Jay-Z]]'s June 1996 debut album, ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]''. 

In 1997,<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/dmx-def-jam-kevin-liles-lyor-cohen-interview-9561232/|title=Executives Lyor Cohen and Kevin Liles Remember DMX & Reveal How He Helped Save Def Jam|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date= May 28, 2022}}</ref> through Irv Gotti, Def Jam signed [[Ruff Ryders]] artist [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]].

After helping [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] with the success of [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] and [[Jay-Z]], [[Russell Simmons]] gave Irv Gotti his own label under Def Jam. While watching ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] during gangster week, a Murder, Inc. logo appeared on the screen and Irv Gotti decided to use the name for his label because [[Murder, Inc.]] put out hits for murder and Irv wanted to put out hit records.

Irv Gotti co-produced all of Ja Rule's 1999 debut album, ''[[Venni Vetti Vecci]]'', as well as his 2000 second studio album, ''[[Rule 3:36]]''. Irv co-produced Rule 3:36's singles ''[[Put It On Me (Ja Rule song)|Put It On Me]]'' and ''[[Between Me and You|Between Me And You]]''.

In 2002, Irv Gotti released ''[[Irv Gotti Presents The Inc]]'', featuring much of Murder Inc.'s roster. Irv cop produced much of the album, including the album's hit single ''[[Down 4 U]]''.

Irv, Ja Rule and the label of Murder Inc. were all involved in a well-publicized feud with G-Unit Records, Aftermath Records and Shady Records over history between 50 Cent and Ja Rule. After this Murder Inc. would change their name to ''The Inc.'' 

Under The Inc. banner, Irv would move the label to [[Universal Motown Records|Universal Motown]] and sign [[Vanessa Carlton]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yeah, Irv Gotti Knows Who Vanessa Carlton Is -- He Just Signed Her |url=https://www.mtv.com/news/0tzwpw/yeah-irv-gotti-knows-who-vanessa-carlton-is-he-just-signed-her |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=MTV |language=en}}</ref> Gotti co-produced Vanessa Carlton's third album, ''Heroes and Thieves'', which was released October 9, 2007, with Channel 7, Rick Rubin and Stephan Jenkins.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-07-03 |title=Irv Gotti Maps Out Inc.

In an interview with [[Angie Martinez]] in early May 2009, Gotti stated that his label, Murder Inc., was leaving Universal Records.

In September 2013, Murder Inc. was relaunched as an umbrella label under Irv Gotti's new label, Visionary.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Diep |first=Eric|title=Irv Gotti Resurrects Murder Inc.

==Legal issues==
=== Money Laundering case ===
On Friday, January 3, 2003, federal agents and [[New York Police Department]] investigators raided the headquarters of Murder Inc. Records, located at [[One Worldwide Plaza]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. The raid was a part of a yearlong investigation into the connection between The Lorenzo brothers and American drug lord [[Kenneth “Supreme” McGriff]]. Investigators believed that the Lorenzos launched Murder Inc. Records using [[illicit drug trade|drug money]] bankrolled by McGriff to launder McGriff’s drug money, as well as help McGriff launder drug money through the making of the 2003 film ''Crime Partners''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtv.com/news/1459376/murder-inc-offices-raided-by-feds/|title=MURDER INC. OFFICES RAIDED BY FEDS|website=[[MTV]] |access-date= May 17, 2022}}</ref> Although computers and documents were seized, no charges were immediately filed, and no arrests were immediately made. The raid was dramatized in the music video for Ja Rule’s ''Murder Reigns''.

Chris and Irv Gotti’s history with McGriff dates back to 1994, when McGriff, newly paroled from prison, met Chris and Irv on the set of a music video in Queens, New York. McGriff wanted to go into cinematography and sought help from Chris and Irv Gotti to produce and direct a film based on [[Donald Goines]]’ Kenyatta series’ novel Crime Partners. The Lorenzos since then maintained a friendship with McGriff, having him appear in the music video for Ja Rule’s 1999 single “Murda 4 Life” and helped finance McGriff’s dream project, ''Crime Partners'', around 2000.

On January 25, 2005, Chris and Irv Gotti surrendered to authorities in New York City and were officially charged with money laundering and conspiracy to launder money. During the trial, Irv Gotti was represented by [[Gerald B. Lefcourt]], and Chris Gotti was represented by [[Gerald Shargel]]. In December 2005, Chris and Irv Gotti were found not guilty of the charges against them.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/gotti-brothers-found-not-guilty-99649/|title=Gotti Brothers Found Not Guilty|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=5 December 2005 |access-date= May 17, 2022}}</ref>

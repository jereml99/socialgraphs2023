Lucanus' childhood saw his father, [[Jan C. Childress]],<ref name="Sifu Jan C. Childress Website">{{cite web|title=Sifu Jan C. Childress|url=http://taichichuanforliving.net/biography.html}}</ref> writing as a contributing journalist for several "Zines" (fan-created magazines) including the Marvel Zombie Society comic,<ref name="Marvel Zombie Society">{{cite web|title=Marvel Zombie Society|url=http://todayincomics.blogspot.com/2011/12/marvel-zombie-society.html|date=December 31, 2011}}</ref> publications such as The Overstreet Comic Book Monthly (an offshoot of [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]) and Comic Critics Calvacade, and writing [[The Good Guys (comics)]] monthly series for [[Jim Shooter]]'s [[Defiant Comics]].<ref name="Jan C.

This marked the beginning of a project development model for  Lucanus' company, [[Creative Impulse Entertainment]] (CIE)<ref name="Creative Impulse Entertainment Official Website" /> a method of sourcing and developing comic book content prime for film and television, inspiring the young filmmaker to call upon his father and several creative partners to create comic books ideas to be moved into production via a new CIE subsidiary, Creative Impulse Publishing,<ref name="Creative Impulse Publishing">{{cite web|title=Creative Impulse Publishing|url=http://www.creativeimpulsepublishing.com/}}</ref> which officially launched in 2007.

As the company's flagship title, ''JFH'' received wide support from both the martial arts and comic book communities, including a comic book giveaway contest with [[Inside Kung Fu]] Magazine,<ref name='Inside Kung Fu Magazine - "Justice For Hire" Contest'>{{cite news|last=Meyers|first=Ric|title=Inside Kung Fu Magazine – "Justice For Hire" Contest|url=http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/81/|access-date=March 26, 2013|newspaper=Inside Kung Fu Magazine|date=August 2007}}</ref> [[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]],<ref name="Black Belt Magazine on Creative Impulse Publishing">{{cite news|title=Black Belt Magazine on Creative Impulse Publishing|url=http://www.justice-for-hire.com/html/downloads.php|access-date=March 26, 2013|newspaper=Black Belt Magazine|date=May 22, 2007}}</ref> and comic book website [[Newsarama]].  ''JFH: Justice-For-Hire'' was followed up with several other Creative Impulse Publishing properties on the comic book market with a focus on digital releases.

Creative Impulse Entertainment branched out into motion comic animation, starting with ''Junior Energy'' (2008),<ref name="Junior Energy Animation">{{cite web|title=Junior Energy Animation| website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaJ_rqPnnIs&list=FL8At4nuGEOam6ZszzenvxTQ}}</ref> a children's intellectual property created, written, and produced by Jan Lucanus and Mercer Boffey for the Clinton Global Initiative<ref name="Clinton Global Initiative website">{{cite web|title=Clinton Global Initiative|url=http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/}}</ref> and JuniorEnergy.org.<ref name=JuniorEnergy.org>{{cite web|title=JuniorEnergy.org|url=http://www.juniorenergy.org/MiddleSchool.aspx}}</ref> Bringing a filmmaker's eye to comics, Lucanus officially began taking credit as a comic book director on actress [[Paula Garcés]]' ''Aluna'' comic books (2010),<ref name="Paula Garces' ">{{cite book|title=Paula Garces' "Aluna" Comic Book|publisher=Creative Impulse Publishing|pages=66}}</ref> where Lucanus ''paneled'' (wrote a shot list for) writer David Cornue's<ref name="David Corneu IMDB">{{cite web|title=David Corneu IMDB|website=[[IMDb]] |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1452761/}}</ref> original script and photo referenced every shot in the story with live actors and props from which comic artist Antonio Rojo<ref name='Antonio Rojo "JFH" Comic Book Interview'>{{cite web|title=Antonio Rojo "JFH" Comic Book Interview|url=http://blog.graphicly.com/interview-antonio-rojo-provides-deadly-artistic-force-to-justice-for-hire-0/}}</ref> used to create original drawings (a process he adopted for his work on capturing martial arts choreography for the ''JFH'' comics). Lucanus then directed the motion comic adaptation of ''Aluna'',<ref name="Aluna - motion comic trailer'">{{cite web|title="Aluna" – motion comic trailer| website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-UHUDIdvac}}</ref> working directly with several notable actors including Paula Garces, [[Ahmed Best]], and [[Malik Yoba]].

Creative Impulse Entertainment partnered with Willow Road Animation<ref name="Willow Road Animation website">{{cite web|title=Willow Road Animation website|url=http://willowroad.squarespace.com/}}</ref> to adapt the ''JFH'' comic book series into a motion comic animation.

== Music ==

Jan Lucanus began singing with his parents who would perform Hindu [[bhajan]]s (songs praising the Hindu pantheon of Gods & Goddesses) on a weekly basis even before his birth. In high school, Lucanus' peers introduced him to rap music, and a few friends were rappers themselves. After several failed attempts to help his friends get record deals, Lucanus had started writing rap lyrics himself. In college, Jan was on the outskirts of the United Nationz rap crew led by Tox Simian<ref name="Tox Simian music">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRk4Dik3OM0|publisher=Tox Simian|access-date=May 21, 2013|title=Tox Simian - Sky is Falling 2 feat. Lone }}</ref> (not to be confused with rapper [[Cam'ron]]'s U.N. group), with his first official featured appearance singing the chorus on the UN track "We So Gangsta". Jan left the crew due to professional differences and focused on filmmaking.

In his senior year of college at NYU, Lucanus took a hip hop class to assist with his performance abilities in prep for his upcoming role in his ''Justice-For-Hire'' featurette. He returned to rap with his creative partner and ''JFH'' co-star Mercer Boffey, a proficient beatboxer,<ref name="Voca People - Mercer Boffey beatboxer">{{cite news|title=Voca People – Mercer Boffey beatboxer|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/show/26045/Voca-People/overview|access-date=March 27, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 12, 2011}}</ref> and performed several times as part of his duties in the class. In addition to rapping together on the "JFH" soundtrack song "Killa Icons" produced by Sage Michael,<ref name="Killa Icons - Ivory featuring Ebony'">{{cite web|title="Killa Icons" – Ivory featuring Ebony|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTlQG7GHh3Q|publisher=Sage Michael Music|access-date=March 27, 2013}}</ref> Lucanus and Mercer later formed a group with several athletes called Strip Hop, a burlesque-style act that included dancing and rapping that Mercer and Jan held in various homes for all female audiences.

== Martial arts ==

Lucanus' mother coerced his father into taking [[Taiji Quan]], [[Karate]], and [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] as a way for the couple to share quality time before Lucanus was born. The son was raised around his parents' martial arts masters and fellow students in [[Chinatown, Manhattan]] in New York. Lucanus has taught martial arts professionally since the age of 16.

In addition to studying under his first teacher, his father, Jan C. Childress,<ref name="Jan C. Childress Tai Chi Website">{{cite web|last=Childress|first=Jan|title=Jan C. Childress Tai Chi Website|url=http://taichichuanforliving.net|publisher=Tai Chi Chuan for Living|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> in the martial arts styles of Yang Tai Chi Chuan, Praying Mantis Kung Fu, and various sets of [[Neigong]] (''nei kung'', internal power building exercises), Lucanus has studied numerous fighting systems. Lucanus' primary Tai Chi teacher was his father's teacher, Sifu Keith Tong – a doctor of Chinese Herbal Medicine whose father, Tong Kwan Tak,<ref name="Tong Kwan Tak tribute">{{cite web|title=Tong Kwan Tak tribute|url=http://taichichuanforliving.net/tribute.html|publisher=Tai Chi Chuan for Living|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> was a direct disciple of [[Wu Kung-i]], a master of the Wu Family Style of Tai Chi Chuan – as well as Sifu Chang Ki Chan who passed down the esoteric style of [[Liuhebafa]] to Jan's father. Jan trained under Shaolin monk [[Shi Yan Ming]] at the U. S. A. Shaolin Temple,<ref name="USA Shoalin Temple website">{{cite web|title=USA Shoalin Temple website|url=http://www.usashaolintemple.org/|publisher=USA Shoalin Temple|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> but was asked to leave the school after fighting in his first tournament – the International Kung Fu Strike Challenge – to win first place and earn a spot on renowned Beijing coach Li Ti Liang's<ref name="Master Li Ti Liang biography">{{cite web|title=Master Li Ti Liang biography|url=https://sites.google.com/site/xinyidaousa/Home/master-li-tai-liang|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> New York International San Shou Team.<ref name="NY International San SHou Team thread">{{cite web|title=NY International San SHou Team thread|url=http://forum.kungfumagazine.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3876|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> San Shou (or [[Sanshou]]) is a full contact fighting sport that combined American boxing, Chinese kickboxing, and Mongolian wrestling (it now incorporates knee and elbow strikes and is known as San Da). Lucanus, at 18 years old, fought on the 2000–2001 team captained by veteran martial arts practitioner, Novell G. Bell,<ref name="Novell G. Bell website">{{cite web|title=Novell G. Bellwebsite|url=http://blacktaoist.com|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> and faced off against Beijing's professional San Shou team in two separate events held at New York's Maritime Hotel. Considered an underdog with his teammates against the Beijing pros that were also formerly coached by Li Ti Liang, Lucanus won a Silver Cup in the fights for the 165&nbsp;lb. weight class under his San Shou fighting nickname, "The Gentleman" . Lucanus dropped off the team to focus on film school (which he was attending while on the team) and began training in Tae Kwon Do and Dragon Style Kung Fu with his long-time friend, Ian Morgan, choreographer of many of Lucanus' action film sequences, and a champion [[Muay Thai]] fighter.<ref name="Ian Morgan fight reel">{{cite web|title=Ian Morgan fight reel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_G0FBkCjc|publisher=NY San Da|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref>

As was standard fair in the Chinatown martial arts community, challenges from other martial artists looking to test their skill level came regularly to Lucanus' weekly 3-hour Tai Chi class with Sifu Keith Tong in Chinatown's Forsythe Park, and Lucanus and his father regularly sought challenges. One day, while Lucanus was on set wrapping production for his [[NYU]] senior thesis film, "Justice-For-Hire",<ref name='Kodak InCamera – "Justice-For-Hire" Interview'>{{cite news|title=Kodak InCamera – "Justice-For-Hire" Interview|url=http://motion.kodak.com/motion/uploadedFiles/justiceforHire.pdf|access-date=March 26, 2013|newspaper=InCamera|date=May 30, 2007}}</ref> his class was challenged by former childhood chess champion [[Joshua Waitzkin]], who had become a top student of the renowned Grandmaster [[William C. C. Chen]] and was in training for the Tai Chi Chung Hwa World Cup.<ref name="Tai Chi World Cup website">{{cite web|title=Tai Chi World Cup website|url=http://www.cttaichi.org/english/articals.php?id=14|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> The father/son duo decided to re-enter the U. S. martial arts tournament circuit together as a team in the sport of Tai Chi Push Hands to compete against Josh ([[pushing hands]] – also known as "t'ui shou" – as played in the Tai Chi World Cup, is a competition combining elements of throwing and grappling arts such as [[Sumo]] & [[Greco-Roman Wrestling]], [[Judo]], [[Aikido]], and [[Shuai Jiao]] with the principles of Tai Chi). The father/son duo won several medals at the 2004 International Chinese Martial Arts Competition in Orlando, Florida in 2004,<ref name="ICMAC competion 2004 photos">{{cite web|title=ICMAC competition 2004 photos|url=http://www.kungfuchampionship.com/orlando/photos-past.html|publisher=International Chinese Martial Arts Championship|access-date=May 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825191117/http://www.kungfuchampionship.com/orlando/photos-past.html|archive-date=August 25, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> but the gold medals were swept Josh and his teammate Daniel Caulfield. After the tournament, the father/son duo was invited to join the first William C. C. Chen (WCCC) U.S. Push Hands Team coached by Josh. The team, consisting of Josh Waitzkin, Daniel Caulfield, Jan C. Childress, Jan Lucanus, Trevor Cohen, Irving Yee, Calum Douglas-Reid, Maximillion Chen, and Parichard Holm, took several trophies at the 2004 Tai Chi World Cup in Taipei, Taiwan. Jan's father took the Bronze World Cup for his weight class. Josh Waitzkin took the title of World Champion, and documented the experience in his book, ''The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance''.<ref name="Art of Learning book">{{cite book|last=Waitzkin|first=Josh|title=The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance [Paperback]|year=2008|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0743277464|pages=288}}</ref>

After the 2005 season, the original WCCC International Push Hands Team disbanded. Several students shifted focus to [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] (BJJ), and Josh introduced Lucanus to Professor John Machado (who would later become a creative partner and mentor for Jan and an advisor for his company). Subsequently, Lucanus trained in the De La Riva<ref name="De La Riva BJJ summary">{{cite web|title=De La Riva BJJ summary|url=http://www.bjjheroes.com/bjj-fighters/ricardo-de-la-riva-wiki-bio|publisher=BJJ Heroes|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> system of BJJ under Professor Jamie Alexandrino,<ref name="Jamie Alexandrino bio">{{cite web|title=Jamie Alexandrino bio|url=http://dmelone.vzwebsites.com/Brazilian-Jiu-Jitsu.html|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> Shuai Jiao, [[freestyle wrestling]], and [[Chan Tai San]]'s Tapered Staff form under Sifu David Ross<ref name="Sifu David Ross bio">{{cite web|title=Sifu David Ross bio|url=http://www.nybestkickboxing.com/about-our-nyc-staff.php|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> at the New York San Da MMA gym, and in Olympic Judo, Greco-Roman Wrestling, and [[Jujutsu]] under Sensei [[Shiro Oishi]] of Oishi Judo Club<ref name="Oishi Judo Club website">{{cite web|title=Oishi Judo Club website|url=http://www.oishi-judo.com/|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref>  – one of New York City's oldest judo clubs located in [[TriBeCa]].

In 2008, Lucanus founded the Martial Arts Creative Team (MACT)<ref name="Martial Arts Creative Team announcement">{{cite web|title=Martial Arts Creative Team announcement|url=http://creativeimpulsecomics.com/Martial_Arts_Creative_Team1wLogo.jpg|publisher=Martial Arts Creative Team|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref> to design unique action choreography for comic books, films, and beyond,<ref name="Phoenix Carnivale interviews Jan Lucanus on MMA comics and film">{{cite news|last=Cayne|first=Al|title=Phoenix Carnivale interviews Jan Lucanus on MMA comics and film|url=http://www.sugarcayne.com/2010/11/creative-impulse-entertainment/|access-date=May 22, 2013|publisher=CAC-TV|date=November 1, 2010}}</ref> as well as a unique style of camerawork to capture the choreography called "Weapon Camera Movement".<ref name="Inside Martial Arts on MACT">{{cite news|title=Inside Martial Arts on MACT|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEKVukipsgc|access-date=May 21, 2013|newspaper=Inside Martial Arts}}</ref> Members include Ian Morgan, John Machado, Maximillion Chen, Mercer Boffey, Aurore Barry,<ref name="Aurore Barry IMDB" /> Hinton Wells, Gabe Dorado, Glenyss Puentavella, and Jordan Forth.<ref name="Jordan Forth website">{{cite web|title=Jordan Forth website|url=http://www.jordanforth.com|access-date=May 21, 2013}}</ref>

In 2009, the William C. C. Chen's (WCCC) U. S. Tai Chi Push Hands Team was reignited, and Lucanus returned as the official captain of the team for the 2009–2011 seasons, running training and tournament preparation, as well as competing alongside his father and Calum Douglas-Reid, and new team members Jordan Forth, Eric William Johnson, Kan Kanzaki, and J. J. Blickstein.

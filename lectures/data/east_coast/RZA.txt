'''Robert Fitzgerald Diggs''' (born July 5, 1969), better known by his stage name '''RZA''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɪ|z|ə}} {{respell|RIZ|ə}}), is an American rapper, actor, filmmaker, and record producer. He is the ''de facto'' leader of the hip hop group [[Wu-Tang Clan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wutang-corp.com/artists/wu-artist.php?id=9 |title=RZA Biography at Wu-Tang Corp. – The Official Site of the Wu-Tang Clan |website=Wutang-corp.com |access-date=August 28, 2016 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023306/http://wutang-corp.com/artists/wu-artist.php?id=9 |url-status=dead }}</ref> having produced most albums for the group and its respective members. He is a cousin of two other original Wu-Tang Clan members: [[GZA]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. He has also released solo albums under the alter-ego '''Bobby Digital''', along with executive producing credits for side projects. After forming the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA was a founding member of the [[horrorcore]] group [[Gravediggaz]], where he went by the name '''The RZArector'''.

RZA has been heavily involved in filmmaking since the late 90s. He has scored a number of films, most notably ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1]]'' (2003) and ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 2]]'' (2004). He has written and directed in film and television, starting with his directorial debut, ''[[The Man with the Iron Fists]]'', in 2012. He has also acted in numerous films and TV series, including the films ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'' and ''[[Brick Mansions]]'', and the TV series ''[[Gang Related (TV series)|Gang Related]]'' and ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]''.

He is especially known for his music production, with a style that includes the use of [[soul music|soul]] samples and sparse beats that has proved highly influential. The magazine ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' placed him on its list of the 20 greatest producers in the magazine's twenty-year history.<ref>[http://createrapbeats.blogspot.com/2008/08/source-magazine-picks-20-greatest.html The Rap Beat Creator: Make Your Own Beats!!!: The Source Magazine Picks 20 Greatest Producers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311214814/http://createrapbeats.blogspot.com/2008/08/source-magazine-picks-20-greatest.html |date=March 11, 2016 }}.

==Early life==
Diggs was born on July 5, 1969, in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn]]. He was named after the Kennedy brothers [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]] and [[John F. Kennedy|John Fitzgerald]], both of whom his mother greatly admired.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200910/20091022_therza.html]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> Diggs has called his given name an "honorable" name, given the legacy of both Robert and John. Diggs has a younger brother, Terrance Hamlin, better known as the rapper [[9th Prince]], and an older brother named '''Mitchell “Divine” Diggs'''.

From ages three to seven, Diggs spent summers in [[North Carolina]] with his uncle, who encouraged him to read and study.<ref name="Tao">{{Cite book |last=RZA |author-link=RZA |year=2009 |title=The Tao of Wu |location=New York |publisher=[[Riverhead Books]] |isbn=978-1-59448-885-6|title-link=The Tao of Wu }}</ref> Diggs was introduced to [[hip hop music]] at the age of nine, and by eleven, was competing in [[rap battles]]. He relocated to [[Steubenville, Ohio]], in 1990, to live with his mother. He spent weekends in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, where his father ran a convenience store in the city's [[Hill District (Pittsburgh)|Hill District]].<ref name="Lolley">Lolley, Sarah (July 13, 2001).

''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''. Retrieved on April 5, 2008.</ref>

Diggs got involved with petty crime and drug-dealing, and was charged with attempted murder while in Steubenville. He was acquitted of the charge, giving him what he has called a "second chance".<ref>Webb, Rory D. (April 10, 2013).

==Music career==
===Before the Wu-Tang Clan===
In 1984, Diggs formed a rap group with his cousins [[Ol' Dirty Bastard|Russell Jones]], then known as The Specialist, and [[GZA|Gary Grice]], then known as Allah Justice, called "Force of the Imperial Master", which they soon after renamed as '''"All in Together Now"''' in 1985. Around this time Diggs formed the DMD Posse which consisted of RZA, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, U-God, [[Inspectah Deck]], 4th Disciple and [[Method Man]].<ref name=HipHopCore>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopcore.net/interviews/93%7ceng-rza.html|title=Hip Hop Core – Interview : RZA – English|website=Hiphopcore.net|access-date=March 26, 2015|archive-date=April 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402191055/http://www.hiphopcore.net/interviews/93%7ceng-rza.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Diggs and Grice then signed with Jamaica Records for management purposes and Jamaica convinced [[Tommy Boy Records]] to sign Diggs as a solo artist in 1989 under the name '''Prince Rakeem'''.<ref name=HipHopCore/>  He released the original ''[[Ooh I Love You Rakeem]]'' promotion version of the EP, but was forced to remix and rerelease the single when Tommy Boy failed to acquire the rights to the original sample. The rereleased version underperformed commercially, and Diggs was subsequently dropped by Tommy Boy.<ref name=HipHopCore/>

===1992–1993: Forming the Wu-Tang Clan===
After a shoot-out in Ohio in 1992, he faced eight years in jail. "When they said 'not guilty', my face stuck in a smile for three days," he recalled. "I was just walking around town, thinking about my daughter and my wife. Right then I said goodbye to anything that would put me in that situation again. I was up on trial on an [[attempted murder]] charge. I was a motherfucking fool, with all that knowledge in my head and ending up there."<ref name="Wilkinson 60">{{cite journal|first= Roy |last= Wilkinson |author-link= Roy Wilkinson |title= One of these men is God |journal= [[Select (magazine)|Select]] |date= July 1997 |page= 60}}</ref>
In 1992, Diggs formed a new group with his two cousins and five other childhood friends. They named the group [[Wu-Tang Clan]], after the 1983 [[kung fu]] film ''[[Shaolin and Wu Tang]]''. As part of the group's formation, each member chose a new nickname for themselves. Diggs chose "RZA", based on a nickname he had been given by fans of his music, "Rza Rza Rakeem", which in turn was based on a song by All in Together Now, "Pza Pza Pumpin", as well as Diggs' [[Graffiti#Tagging|graffiti tag]], "Razor". He created a [[backronym]] for "RZA", stating that the name stood for "Ruler, Zig-Zag-Zig, Allah" which further translated into "Ruler, Knowledge-Wisdom-Understanding, Allah" when using the [[Supreme Alphabet]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide, Volume 1: East Coast and West Coast |editor=Mickey Hess |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XkCncJ7j744C&pg=PA125 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |page=125 |isbn=9780313343216 |access-date=February 23, 2018 |archive-date=June 29, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230629171216/https://books.google.com/books?id=XkCncJ7j744C&pg=PA125 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Wu-Tang Clan released its first single, "[[Protect Ya Neck]]", in December 1992. [[Masta Killa]] then joined the group in 1993, becoming its ninth member. They released their debut album, ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'' in November 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rza-mn0000864652/biography|title=RZA – Biography – AllMusic|author=Jason Ankeny|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 26, 2015|archive-date=October 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031201329/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rza-mn0000864652/biography|url-status=live}}</ref> RZA operated as Wu-Tang Clan's de facto leader, producing the group's songs and deciding who would get placed on which tracks.

===1994–1996: Gravediggaz and Wu-Tang solo projects: Round one===
As each of the group's members embarked on solo careers, RZA continued to produce nearly everything Wu-Tang released during the period 1994–1996, which included both composing and arranging the instrumental tracks as well as overseeing and directing the creative process. RZA's rule over the Clan at this time is described in 2004's ''Wu-Tang Manual'' book as "a dictatorship". He also released a hit single of his own, in the form of "[[High School High (soundtrack)|Wu-Wear: The Garment Renaissance]]". The song was featured on the ''[[High School High]]'' soundtrack, and was released to promote the Wu-Tang clothing brand, also called "[[Wu-Wear]]". It peaked at #60 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and #6 on the [[Hot Rap Singles]] chart.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p116447 |title=RZA |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=July 5, 1969 |access-date=March 31, 2012 |archive-date=January 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111043346/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p116447 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{blockquote| When it came time for the Gravediggaz, [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]] was thinking about putting a group together. He wanted to get some good MCs. [[Anthony Ian Berkeley|Poetic]] was another dope MC who was underrated out on [[Long Island]]. He had one single out on Tommy Boy that didn't take off, but he was a dope MC. As the Grym Reaper, you know how many dope lyrics he dropped. Frukwan, one of the top lyricists out of [[Stetsasonic]]. He and Paul were friends already. He told him about me. He said, "I know this one guy who is super-dope."

At the same time, I was also trying to do Wu-Tang. I was trying to start my own company and stuff, so when Paul called me up and invited me to his crib on Long Island and told me his idea for forming this group, I thought it would be an honor to be in a group with him. But I told him, "I'm also producing a group, and I'm also part of a family that I'm building." He said, "Yo, that's crazy." We would talk a lot of times. [Ol' Dirty Bastard] came to his house a lot of times with me. [Method Man], too. We all would just go there and try to find ways to get out of the streets. Me, I was trying to get out of the ghetto. Paul had a lot of respect for me, so he helped me break out of it. I think he liked that I was so dark, but I didn't know I was dark.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wuforever.com/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=74&page=1 |title=Wuforever Wu-Tang Community – Home – latest Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface, Rza, Gza, Deck, U-God, ODB Updates and MP3s |website=Wuforever.com |access-date=2010-08-19 |archive-date=February 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211094358/http://wuforever.com/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=74&page=1 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}

===1997: ''Wu-Tang Forever''===
1997 saw the release of ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'', the Wu-Tang Clan's highly anticipated second album. The album for the first time featured RZA delegating a small number of beat-making duties to other producers in the Wu-Tang camp, such as his protégés [[Mathematics (producer)|Mathematics]], [[True Master]] and [[4th Disciple]] who are known as the original [[Wu-Elements]], and Clan member [[Inspectah Deck]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wuforever.com/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=63&page=1|title=Home|website=Wuforever.com|access-date=December 19, 2019|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806201819/http://wuforever.com/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=63&page=1|url-status=live}}</ref>

===1998–1999: Gravediggaz and Wu-Tang solo projects: Round two===
During the 1998–2000 period RZA ceased to produce every Wu-Tang solo album as he had done previously, but continued to contribute usually one or two songs on average to each record as well as receiving an Executive Producer credit.

{{blockquote|"I had to put out ''Bobby Digital'' instead of ''The Cure'' because if I didn't do that I would've suffered two things. First, I would have revealed where I was musically too soon. Wu-Tang is the perfect medium to expose anything new because I got the most people coming together to buy it. For me to expose it for my own self, I don't think that would've been a wise thing for me to do. I might've caught more people than Bobby Digital caught, but I still wouldn't catch the magnitude of what the Wu-Tang could catch. Maybe this year or next year the game may be different. ''The Cure'' is so intimate in writing that you gotta live that Cure shit. I was living like Bobby Digital in '98, '99 na'mean? So if I put "The Cure" out, then I wouldn't even be able to get on stage and perform it for ya'll cause I'd be lying."}}

===2001–2004: Post ''The W'' solo projects===
In 1999 the RZA moved into composing film scores. His first work, [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai]]'' (1999), earned praise; he also had a brief cameo in the film itself, as a fellow samurai wearing camouflage. The experience was positive and, as he noted during an interview on [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Fresh Air]]'', the work with traditional musicians gave him the desire to learn how to read and write music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4525189|title=Rapper, producer, Composer: The RZA|date=March 7, 2005|website=Npr.org|access-date=March 26, 2015|archive-date=April 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134220/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4525189|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2004, he co-scored [[David S. Goyer|David S. Goyer's]] ''"[[Blade: Trinity]]"'' with composer [[Ramin Djawadi]].

{{blockquote|This is one of my biggest adventures, and one of my [best] feelings. We watched ''[[Kill Bill]]'' in [[Manhattan]]. At the premiere, that happened, but you know, that's Hollywood. But in Manhattan, a theater, just a bunch of kids coming from wherever New York, inside a movie theater and the movie's coming on. They don't even know that I'm the man with the music, and when it said, "Original Music by The RZA", we hear the audience clapping. And they didn't clap for nothing else, because the movie's just coming on. I was like, 'Wow, what the fuck is that about?' That's different. It actually might be something special. You never care who did that... Once you see who stars in the shit, you don't read "edited", you don't read all that. You be eating your popcorn and it go right by you. But, for somebody to see that and then clap, that's a different thing right there. That felt pretty pleasing.}}

===2005–present: Solo projects: Round three===
[[File:Wu Tang Clan f7866559.jpg|thumb|left|RZA at the 2007 [[Eurockéennes]]]]
He has also stated that the long-delayed ''The Cure'' album will be his final solo album, so that he can devote more time to his movie directing career.<ref>{{cite news |author=Feature by Dave Kerr. |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/42451-rzarecting-bobby |title=RZArecting Bobby |publisher=The Skinny |date=April 8, 2008 |access-date=March 31, 2012 |archive-date=June 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608175629/http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/42451-rzarecting-bobby |url-status=live }}</ref>

Before signing with [[SRC Records]] in 2007, RZA was flooded with offers from [[Bad Boy Records]], [[Aftermath Records]], [[Interscope]] and [[Def Jam]] among others for the Wu-Tang Clan super-group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wutang-corp.com/news/article.php?id=227|title=Cilvaringz: Wu-Tang Report :: news articles at Wu-Tang Corp. – The Official Site of the Wu-Tang Clan|website=Wutang-corp.com|access-date=March 26, 2015|archive-date=December 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203051209/http://wutang-corp.com/news/article.php?id=227|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2007, he produced the [[Afro Samurai: The Album|score]] of the Japanese anime ''[[Afro Samurai]]'' starring [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. In 2007 he released the little-publicized instrumental album ''[[The RZA-Instrumental Experience]]'', and worked with Raekwon on his highly anticipated ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II]]''.

==Wu-Recording labels==
Since the early 1990s, various [[List of Wu-Recording record labels|Wu Tang Clan-affiliated recording labels]] were established. The earlier labels are believed to be dissolved. The connection that RZA had to these labels is unknown.

Other record labels were later founded in the early 2000s, and are still active in the present. Very little is known about these labels, other than the fact that RZA produces music on them. It is unknown if RZA is CEO, or has high position within these labels, considering that he was never known to have a CEO position of any recording label.

==Artistry==
RZA's production technique, specifically the manner of chopping up and/or speeding or slowing soul samples to fit his beats, has been imitated by hip hop producers including [[Kanye West]] and [[Just Blaze]]. West's own take on RZA's style<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1096499-5,00.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320224340/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1096499-5,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=March 20, 2007 | magazine=Time | title=Why You Can't Ignore Kanye | date=August 21, 2005 | access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed "chipmunk soul," the speeding of a vocal sample to where it sounded as though the singer had inhaled helium. Several producers at the time copied the style, creating other offshoots. West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by the RZA's production, saying<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gale.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/west_k.htm |title=Gale - Free Resources - Black History - Biographies - Kanye West |access-date=June 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615083612/http://www.gale.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/west_k.htm |archive-date=June 15, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{blockquote|"Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time... We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the [production] style I use, RZA has been doing that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1553911/20070305/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye, Run-DMC, Outkast, Justin Sound Off on Our Top 10 Hip-Hop Groups|work=MTV News|access-date=March 26, 2015|archive-date=November 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115154114/http://www.mtv.com/news/1553911/kanye-run-dmc-outkast-justin-sound-off-on-our-top-10-hip-hop-groups/|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

In response, RZA himself has spoken quite positively of the comparisons:

{{blockquote|"All good. I got super respect for Kanye. He came up to me about a year or two ago. He gave me mad praising and blessings... For people to say Wu-Tang inspire Kanye, Kanye is one of the biggest artists in the world. That goes back to what we say: 'Wu-Tang is forever.'

After hearing Kanye's work on ''[[The Blueprint]]'', RZA claimed that a torch-passing had occurred between him and West, saying, "The shoes gotta be filled. If you ain't gonna do it, somebody else is gonna do it. That's how I feel about rap today."<ref name="RealNetworks, Inc"/>

His Bobby Digital albums introduced tweaked-out [[new-age music|new age]] elements to his sound; these have incorporated themselves more fully into his beats on newer albums such as Method Man's ''[[4:21... The Day After]]''.

{{blockquote|"The way I produce now is I produce more like a musician", RZA said. "In the old days, I produced more like a DJ. I didn't understand [[music theory]] at all. Now that I do understand music theory, I make my music more playable, meaning not only could you listen to it, you could get someone else to play it. Before, you couldn't even write down Wu-Tang music. I think almost 80 percent of this record can be duplicated by a band, which is important for music, because that means 10 years from now, somebody can make a whole song out of it and cover it like how I'm covering [[The Beatles]] song."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/index/2010-06-26T06_25_38-07_00 |title=PodOmatic &#124; Podcast – Conspiracy Worldwide Hip Hop Radio – [Part 2&#93; Live Guests – ASSASSINATE THE MEDIA SPECIAL w/ The RZA – Tech N9ne – Freddie Foxx (aka.

'''Edreys Wajed''', also known as '''Billy Drease Williams''' is an American [[hip hop]] artist, [[emcee]], singer and producer from [[Buffalo, New York]]; known for his uptempo production, clean lyrics, and motivational messages. Billy Drease Williams started as part of a short lived hip hop group called The Elements (formed with [[Soulive]] members Alan Evans and Neal Evans) and later was one half of a duo known as Raw Intel (with producer Trevor "TrevThorne" Drayton). Acclaimed Music critic Jeff Miers has described him as “the most promising, adventurous, nigh-on-visionary hip hop artist Buffalo has yet produced.”<ref name="buffalospree1">[http://www.buffalospree.com/Buffalo-Spree/December-2012/Buffalo-Game-Changers-Edreys-Wajed/ Buffalo Game Changers: Edreys Wajed – Buffalo Spree – December 2012 – Buffalo, NY].

Raw Intel found success early, placing five songs on the [[ESPN NFL 2K5]] Video Game,<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/xbox/920177-espn-nfl-2k5/faqs/31361 ESPN NFL 2K5 (XBOX) Milestones/Crib Unlockables FAQ by JPaterson]. GameFAQs. Retrieved on 2014-02-19.</ref> and producing a little-known but highly acclaimed self-titled album in 2002/2003. Billy Drease also collaborated with Soulive again for their [[Turn It Out Remixed]] Album and released a project on Velour Records with drummer Alan Evans, entitled M.E.K.A. 54.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/MEKA-54/dp/B003FG88Q4 MEKA 54: Music]. Amazon.com. Retrieved on 2014-02-19.</ref>

After the Raw Intel album failed to provide Billy with a viable major label deal, he focused his efforts on production and visual art: placing several tracks on films and television, including [[Lionsgate]] Films' "The Farce of the Penguins" and [[Lifetime Television]]'s "Officer Down"; as well as opening an independent art gallery in Buffalo called Gallery 51.<ref>[http://www.buffaloplace.com/popupleaf/gallery51/409 Gallery 51] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104154/http://www.buffaloplace.com/popupleaf/gallery51/409 |date=2011-07-08 }}. Buffalo Place. Retrieved on 2014-02-19.</ref> Additionally, he produced several tracks for [[Atlanta]]-based [[rapper]], [[Stat Quo]].<ref>[http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2009/02/05/stat-quo-checks-balances-mixtape/ Stat Quo – Checks & Balances (Mixtape)]. 2DOPEBOYZ (2009-02-05).

Negativland.com. Retrieved on 2014-02-19.</ref> and signed a deal with Buffalo-based independent label [[Deep Thinka Records]], which then proceeded to re-brand themselves as [[DTR45]]. Creatively invigorated by the deal, Billy's first single "I Like It" – a raw chopped up rendition of a Betty Wright tune –  secured features in [[Billboard Magazine]]<ref name="billboard1">[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045767/edreys Edreys].

Originally performing as solo artist under his birth name, Edreys decided to take on the moniker Billy Drease Williams right around the same time I Like It dropped. This change in stage name was both in homage to the actor [[Billy Dee Williams]] and as a way for the pronunciation of birth name to still be present within his stage name.<ref>[http://www.rapreviews.com/interview/edreys2010.html RapReview Feature for June 15, 2010 – Billy Drease Williams Interview].

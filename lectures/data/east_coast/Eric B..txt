==Life==
Eric B. was born on November 8, 1963 in [[East Elmhurst]], [[Queens, New York|Queens]]. He attended [[William Cullen Bryant High School]] under a basketball scholarship.

"But music became a priority."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:16057716|title = Press bio for Eric B. & Rakim - Cornell University Library Digital Collections}}</ref>

===Music career===
Eric B. started deejaying with his younger brother and two friends at a roller rink.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:16057830|title = "Checking out Eric B. & Rakim" - Cornell University Library Digital Collections}}</ref> He cites deejays such as DJ Vernon, King Charles, and Grandmaster Flash as early influences, recalling: "I remember sneaking out to the armories at night, sneaking out to the parties at St. Gabriel School on Astoria Boulevard".<ref name="RS2018">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/eric-b-rakim-talk-reunion-the-birth-of-cool-and-being-the-greatest-630571/|title = Eric B. & Rakim Talk Reunion, the Birth of Cool and Being the Greatest| magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date = 24 April 2018}}</ref> By 1985, Eric B. worked as a DJ at the New York radio station [[WBLS]]; there, he sought to find an artist to rap over his DJing, which led him to meet [[Rakim]].<ref name="RSBio">{{citation|encyclopedia=The [[Rolling Stone]] Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2001|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ericbandrakim/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222133155/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ericbandrakim/biography|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 22, 2007|title=Eric B and Rakim: Biography|access-date=September 5, 2008}}</ref> Eric B. had also considered work with [[Freddie Foxxx]], but was unable to successfully meet with him before forming his partnership with Rakim.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://inverseculture.com/blogs/features/the-dopest-photo-in-hip-hop-the-paid-in-full-posse|title=The Dopest Photo In Hip-Hop: The Paid in Full Posse|work=Inverse Culture|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729095043/https://inverseculture.com/blogs/features/the-dopest-photo-in-hip-hop-the-paid-in-full-posse|archive-date=2017-07-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Eric B. and Rakim released their first single, "Eric B. Is President," in 1986. Eric B. included an uncredited sample of [[James Brown]]'s "Funky President" on the track,<ref name="RS2018" /> which led Brown to sue the duo, in one of the earliest court cases related to sampling in hip-hop.<ref name="RSBio" /> The duo then went on to release their debut album, ''[[Paid in Full (album)|Paid in Full]]'', in 1987. This album was highly acclaimed immediately upon its release, and has come to be regarded as one of the greatest albums in hip-hop history; Eric B. has been praised for his "martial and percussive" production and effective use of samples on the album.<ref name="RS2018" /><ref name="MTV"/>

After three more albums, Eric B. and Rakim's record contract with [[MCA Records|MCA]] came to a close. Concerned that Rakim might abandon him, Eric B. refused to sign the release contract, leading to a protracted legal battle between him, Rakim, and the label.<ref name="ALLMUSIC"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/08/27/642400564/rakim-reflects-on-his-life-in-hip-hop-and-what-happened-with-eric-b|title=Rakim Reflects On His Life In Hip-Hop And What Happened With Eric B.|publisher=NPR|date=August 29, 2018|access-date=September 8, 2021}}</ref> This situation led the duo to split up completely in 1992. After separating from Rakim, Eric B. released one solo album – 1995's ''Eric B.'' – but primarily worked as a producer and executive for Street Life Records, a now-defunct subsidiary of [[Scotti Brothers Records]].<ref name="RSBio" />

Eric B. and Rakim fell out of contact after they ceased to collaborate musically, but in 2016, they reconnected and announced their reunion. The duo has once again begun holding concerts, and is working on remastering their albums, but indicated that they were not planning to release new music.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eric-b-rakim-to-reunite-for-2017-tour-album-reissues-w446291|title=Eric B. & Rakim to Reunite for 2017 Tour, Album Reissues|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 22, 2016|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref>

He released three mixtapes as a teenager: "Entendre" – Anxiety (2014), I'm So Anxious (2016), and I'm So Anonymous (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ok-tho.com/2014/06/entendre-anxiety-mixtape.html|title=Entendre – Anxiety [Mixtape]|date=June 24, 2014 |via="OK-THO" Blog|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://musiconthedot.com/entendre-im-anxious-mixtape/|title=Entendre – I'm So Anxious (Mixtape)|date=August 8, 2016|via=Music On The Dot|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/im-so-anonymous/1271420541|title=I'm so Anonymous|date=August 9, 2017|via=iTunes|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> He graduated from high school in 2015 and decided to go to college at [[Towson University]]. He dropped out in 2018, explaining that college was "bigger than him" as a first-generation student, and he was mainly doing it for his mother. He moved to Los Angeles shortly afterward.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elevatormag.com/ybn-cordae-is-fully-prepared-for-his-bright-future/|title=YBN CORDAE IS FULLY PREPARED FOR HIS BRIGHT FUTURE|via=Elevator Mag|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
===2018–2019: Early beginnings, record deal, and ''The Lost Boy''===
Cordae began taking his rap career seriously in early 2018. When visiting Los Angeles, he hung around [[YBN Nahmir]] and YBN Almighty Jay , whom he'd met through social media. Nahmir had reached out to Cordae after hearing a song Dunston made with his brother Simba.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elevatormag.com/ybn-cordae-met-nahmir-and-almighty-jay-through-xbox-live/|title=YBN CORDAE MET NAHMIR AND ALMIGHTY JAY THROUGH XBOX LIVE|via=Elevator Mag|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=7780865.18|title=YBN cordae is easily the best out of the group|date=May 13, 2018 |via=kanyetothe.com|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> Dunston is the only member of YBN who hadn't been introduced through video games. He said he already felt like a part of YBN, and so changed from "Entendre" to "YBN Cordae". He also said that Entendre had been a name that he'd wanted to change for while: "I was just always around Nahmir and shit, those were just like my brothers... And, I was thinking, yo, I need to change my shit to like, Cordae, and shit, my actual first name. I was already "YBN" without the social tag".<ref name="Open Space: YBN Cordae"/>

In May 2018, Cordae released his first single, which he called his "introduction to the world": a remix of the 1999 song "[[My Name Is]]" by [[Eminem]]. He released the song along with a music video via [[WorldStarHipHop]] on YouTube. He then released "Old Niggas" as a response to "1985" by J. Cole, followed by the tracks "Fighting Temptations" and "[[Kung Fu (YBN Cordae song)|Kung Fu]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.z-pov.com/music/2018/5/19/ybn-cordae-the-outspoken-artist-declaring-the-new-generation-of-rap-has-promise|title=YBN Cordae, The Outspoken Artist Declaring The New Generation of Rap Has Promise|via=z-pov.com|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2018/05/17/the-10-best-new-rap-songs-right-now|title=The 10 best new rap songs right now|via=The Fader|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://revolt.tv/stories/2018/07/11/ybn-cordae-releases-track-video-kung-fu-070080e9ff|title=YBN Cordae releases new track and video "Kung Fu"|via=Revolt TV|access-date=July 30, 2018|archive-date=August 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814002111/https://revolt.tv/stories/2018/07/11/ybn-cordae-releases-track-video-kung-fu-070080e9ff|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''Respect Magazine'' opined in 2018 that Dunston was ahead of his time as a rapper. "He is a mix of the old and new school, and the deliverance and perception of his music sets himself apart from the new generation of rappers these days. We get a clear glimpse of this in his music videos for "Old N*ggas," 'My Name Is,' and 'Kung Fu,' which all have over 5 million views on YouTube. He is building a solid buzz for himself day by day, and letting the world know his bars and rhymes are ahead of his time. He has yet to drop a project proving such."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://respect-mag.com/2018/08/ahead-of-the-game-ybn-cordae/|title=Ahead Of The Game: Cordae|via=Respect Magazine|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref>

Revolt TV said in 2018, "There's always going to be artists who go against the grain and manage to generate conversation without being mundane or routine.  Cordae is the result of perfect timing, a need for change and managing to bridge the gap between aesthetic and talent. He's the Gohan of the YBN collective, appearing docile and juvenile but displaying a 'mastery' over words that seems at odds with old-school "hip-hoppers" belief about his age group. It is yet to be seen if his talent warrants the praise he's receiving."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://revolt.tv/stories/2018/05/31/industry-plant-conversation-longer-place-rap-music-070040ea8f|title=The 'industry plant' conversation no longer has a place in rap music|via=Revolt TV|access-date=July 30, 2018|archive-date=August 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814002107/https://revolt.tv/stories/2018/05/31/industry-plant-conversation-longer-place-rap-music-070040ea8f|url-status=dead}}</ref>

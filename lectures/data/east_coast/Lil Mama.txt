The album spawned her four major singles including her staple song and dance anthem "[[Lip Gloss]]", earning her two [[Teen Choice Awards]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Monster Single of the Year|Monster Single of the Year]] nominations at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. Kirkland gained further attention in [[pop music]] after a collaboration with [[Avril Lavigne]] for the remix of her hit single "[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]".

Kirkland took a hiatus from music after success of her hit single "Hustler Girl" to stay focused on serving as a judge for total of seven seasons on [[MTV]]'s ''[[America's Best Dance Crew]]'' at the age of 19 from 2008 to 2012, which made her one of the youngest judges on any competitive television series in history. Working with producer and fellow judge [[Randy Jackson]], she served alongside [[JC Chasez]], [[Shane Sparks]], [[Mario Lopez]], and [[Layla Kayleigh]].

She was cast in her [[Breakthrough role|breakout role]] of [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]] in the [[VH1]] biographical film ''[[CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story]]'', which aired in October 2013 and garnered 4.5 million views in the first night.

== Early life ==
Niatia Jessica Kirkland was born on October 4, 1989, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], and is the eldest daughter of eight children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahradio/Rapper-Lil-Mama-Audio |title=Rapper Lil' Mama - Audio - Oprah.com |access-date=October 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514113808/http://www.oprah.com/oprahradio/Rapper-Lil-Mama-Audio |archive-date=May 14, 2013 }}</ref> She was raised in [[Harlem]] from her kindergarten to her eighth-grade year. She moved back to Brooklyn and attended [[Edward R. Murrow High School]] until her senior year where she continued her education through independent studies. Kirkland is a third generation of West African, Trinidadian, and Jamaican descent and the third born child. Being the oldest daughter, she got her nickname "Lil Mama". She has two older brothers and three younger brothers, one of whom is also a dancer and underground rapper along with her younger sister and last brother. She has one maternal aunt and several paternal uncles.

Kirkland faced personal and financial struggles at an early age and experienced even more poverty when her mother, Tara, was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]], which often led Kirkland to struggle in school as she had to care for her siblings and see her mother back and forth in hospitals from procedures. Both her parents had separated when she was a young child, but Kirkland always maintained a close relationship with her father, visiting him consistently. Her family became homeless and their mother had moved her and her siblings into a shelter due to poverty at the time. Kirkland told [[WWPR-FM|Power 105.1]] she stayed in the shelters for seven years from her kindergarten year until the beginning of her eighth-grade year when they managed to get an apartment in [[the Bronx]] and gain more stability. Her younger sibling's father was deceased, so her mother was the matriarch of her family. She contributed to helping her mother financially by taking up small jobs such as baking. Growing up, Kirkland witnessed many hardships in her community including gang and drug violence, teen pregnancy, and domestic violence.

After her mother's fight with cancer became terminal, her mother moved in with Kirkland's aunt and Tara's older sister. She stayed there so she could be cared for and help with the care of the younger children in her family.

As one of eight children, she began to express herself artistically by writing [[poetry]] and music. She trained at dance schools for [[ballet]], [[jazz dance]], [[tap dance]], South African dance, [[hip hop dance]], and [[street dance]]; she was in many competitions and recitals making her a professional dancer. She was influenced by [[MC Lyte]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Lisa Lopes]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Lauryn Hill]], and her parents. Her mother was a talented singer and her father Allen Brunner was a musician and DJ. Kirkland decided to explore her talents further when she took interest in the rap culture, and from then on she continued to perfect her talent in rapping and managed to become an avid free-stylist.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Kirkland became known as the "Voice of the Young People" for being a teen sensation and connecting with her younger fans as she continued to present herself as that and embrace it in her music videos and songs. She became the "Queen of Hip-Pop" for mixing her rhymes with pop influences, which started after her collaboration with [[Avril Lavigne]]. She first introduced herself as the "Birth of Hip-Pop" at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]] sporting a baby-styled look. She later told [[MTV]] how she intended to spread and influence more artists to spread the genre of [[Pop rap|hip-pop]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2292099/new-video-lil-mama-life/|title = New Video: Lil Mama, 'L.I.F.E.'|website = [[MTV]]}}</ref> After her 2009 re-release of her single "L.I.F.E.", Kirkland introduced her fans to a whole new side of the darker reality that young people face. The song was followed by a music video that incorporated the themes of the song which included teen pregnancy, drug addiction, child abandonment, domestic violence, and more. This showed Kirkland as a legitimate rapper for even adults to listen to.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Since the release of her first album, Kirkland has been in and out of studios making new music. She released the single "Doughboy" (featuring [[Mishon]]). After that release she made appearances on tracks with other artists, including "Turn It Up" by Mishon and "Sexiest" by Yahaira.

She then released two more singles entitled "Scrawberry" and "Hustler Girl", both singles were followed by music videos. "Scrawberry" introduced a new look for Kirkland, in which she would wear colorful wigs and futuristic attire; this would be her new style for next few years; however, the song was released on her [[Myspace|MySpace]] page and [[YouTube]], it was unclear if it was removed from streaming services along with her other two singles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-mama-hustler-girl-new-song.549582.html|title = Lil Mama - Hustler Girl|website = HNHH|date = 2 November 2011}}</ref> "Hustler Girl" garnered $1.5 million which topped the income she received from her ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hits "[[Shawty Get Loose]]" and "[[Lip Gloss]]", which earned her $1 million and $800,000.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} Her next collaboration to follow, "Billionaire" by Prince Malik, would earn her $1.8 million.

Kirkland was featured on [[Lil Wayne]]'s "[[A Milli]]"; she was brought on stage at his concerts to perform the song.

Their crew garnered more recognition after making their appearance on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' and received a cash reward from DeGeneres herself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/amp/2018/10/waffle-dance-crew-ellen-walmart-donation|title = W.A.F.F.L.E.

==Controversies ==
At the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], Kirkland came onstage while [[Jay-Z]] and [[Alicia Keys]] performed "[[Empire State of Mind]]". While Jay-Z was ending his final verse, Kirkland left her seat in the audience, got onto the stage, and started bobbing her head to the beat. Jay-Z was surprised, but continued to perform. Right before this moment, [[Beyoncé]] had tried to hold her from going up. Jay-Z patted Kirkland on the leg to fall back, jokingly telling her, "you [[T-Pain]]ing now," a reference to a similar incident two months earlier when T-Pain jumped on stage with Jay-Z at [[Summer Jam (festival)|Summer Jam]] during his performance of "[[D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)]]". At the end of the performance, Kirkland came to foreground and posed alongside Jay-Z and Keys. She later clarified that she "would never ... try to disrespect Jay-Z or take a moment that someone has created it and try to relive it. I'm too original for that and I respect him too much for that."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Steiner |first=Sam |title=Kanye the First |doi=10.5040/9781784604660.00000002 |year=2017 |isbn=9781784604660}}</ref> In October 2009, she appeared in [[America's Next Top Model (season 13)|cycle 13]] of ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' with [[Benny Ninja]].

On August 11, 2011, Kirkland was a guest on ''[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]]''. While on the air, tensions rose between her and fellow DJ [[Charlamagne tha God]] as they exchanged jabs, with Charlamagne bringing up her VMAs incident and the controversy between her and [[Nicki Minaj]]. Two more DJs, [[Angela Yee]] and [[DJ Envy]], chimed in, discussing her absence from music at the time. After some time, Kirkland broke down in tears when her mother's passing was brought up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ballerstatus.com/2011/07/20/lil-mama-breaks-down-in-tears-after-charlamagne-tha-god-goes-in-during-radio-interview/|title = Lil Mama Breaks Down in Tears, After Charlamagne Tha God Goes in During Radio Interview|date = 20 July 2011}}</ref> Kirkland crying spawned numerous memes around the internet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rap-up.com/2016/01/12/lil-mama-returns-to-the-breakfast-club/|title = Lil Mama Returns to "The Breakfast Club"}}</ref> Five years later, Kirkland returned to ''The Breakfast Club'' to explain why she cried, and the DJs and Kirkland exchanged apologies with one another.

On March 10, 2016, Kirkland was arrested for driving 38&nbsp;mph in a 25&nbsp;mph speed zone with a revoked license. The incident took place in Harlem at around 4 a.m. Officers conducted an investigation and Kirkland's driver's license was revoked. She went on to make a statement apologizing to her family, friends, and fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/747654/lip-gloss-rapper-lil-mama-arrested-in-new-york|title = "Lip Gloss" Rapper Lil Mama Arrested in New York|date = 10 March 2016}}</ref>

Bow Wow set Kirkland on blind date with his friend BT, a radio personality, in December 2018, and caused controversy by allegedly saying that "Y'all gonna be f**king in a week."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bossip.com/1685115/lil-mama-says-she-wants-to-slap-bow-wow/|title = Bye Bow Wow!

==Background==
Kirschner was born in [[Spanish Harlem]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to a [[Jewish]] father with ancestry from [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], and a [[Sicilian-American]] mother who converted to [[Judaism]]. Kirschner identifies herself as a spiritual Jew.<ref name=princesssome>Westbrook, Caroline. [http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/279_interview_with_a_jew.htm Interview with a Jewish Princess] June 2, 2002, accessdate=2008-09-30</ref>
Her parents were [[psychologist]]s. When Kirschner was a child, the family moved to rural [[Pennsylvania]] and then to the suburbs of [[Philadelphia]]. She attended school at the [[Germantown Academy]], a private high school, where she was a member of the Theatre Club and the Black Student Union. She moved to New York City at the age of 17 and went to NYU, where she got her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] in drama. She is an active member of Superstar Machine, and was a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emusician.com/remixmag/artists_interviews/musicians/remix_time_machine/index.html |title=Time Machine |publisher=Emusician.com |date=2005-10-01 |access-date=2012-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605061215/http://emusician.com/remixmag/artists_interviews/musicians/remix_time_machine/index.html |archive-date=2011-06-05 }}</ref> She is married to Luis Miguel Ortega and has a daughter Siren Ortega, and they live in Santa Monica, CA.

==Career==

Their other recordings appeared on various compilations.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Gamma+Rays| title = Gamma Rays at Discogs.com| website = [[Discogs]]}}</ref> Around the same time, Kirschner was composing hip hop-styled songs on a 4-track recorder.

===Princess Superstar===
In 1994, Kirschner made a demo tape, ''Mitch Better Get My Bunny'', under the name "Princess Superstar". She sent the tape to the ''[[College Music Journal]]'' and to the [[Beastie Boys]]' [[Grand Royal Records]].

In 1995, she teamed up with three backing musicians and signed with 5th Beetle Records. They recorded her debut album, ''[[Strictly Platinum]]'', which gained her some notoriety as being one of very few white female rappers.

In 1997, Kirschner went on to launch her own record label, first calling it "A Big Rich Major Label", but then eventually settling on "Corrupt Conglomerate". She recruited a new crew of backing musicians and recorded ''CEO'', a concept album about [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]].

Her next album, 2000's ''Last of the Great 20th Century Composers'', was co-produced by Curtis Curtis and contains the song "Kool Keith's Ass", and a remix of "Do It Like a Robot" by [[Blues Explosion]].

Kirschner went on to collaborate with [[Kool Keith]] on "Keith and Me" for the 2001 ''Princess Superstar Is'' LP released on Ruthless Records/[[Studio !K7]]. The album, co-produced Curtis Curtis, has guest appearances by [[Beth Orton]] and [[Bahamadia]]. The single "Bad Babysitter" was number 11 on the UK Singles Chart.

'''Christopher Douglass Roney''' (born December 15, 1969), known by the stage name '''Cool C''', is an American former rapper active in the late 1980s. He is also known for his involvement in the murder of [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia Police]] officer [[Murder of Lauretha Vaird|Lauretha Vaird]] during a bank robbery in January 1996, for which he was sentenced to death. He is currently on death row.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
In the mid-1980s, Roney was an original member of the [[Philadelphia]]-based Hilltop Hustlers hip hop crew. His 1987 debut single, "Juice Crew Dis", which took aim at the New York-based hip hop crew run by influential rap producer [[Marley Marl]] (a group that included [[Kool G Rap]] and [[Big Daddy Kane]]), gained Roney a good amount of attention.<ref>{{cite magazine |title= Cool C – Biography Billboard.com |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |url= http://www.billboard.com/artist/299634/cool-c/biography |accessdate= January 9, 2015 |archive-date= December 7, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181207000753/https://www.billboard.com/artist/299634/cool-c/biography |url-status= dead }}</ref>

A pair of 1988 singles for Hilltop and City Beat Records landed Roney a contract with [[Atlantic Records]], where he released two full-length solo albums: his debut ''[[I Gotta Habit]]'' in 1989 and ''Life in the Ghetto'' in 1990. Both albums stayed on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for numerous weeks.<ref>{{cite magazine |title= Cool C – Chart History Billboard.com |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |url= http://www.billboard.com/artist/299634/cool-c/chart |accessdate= January 9, 2015 |archive-date= December 6, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181206235153/https://www.billboard.com/artist/299634/cool-c/chart |url-status= dead }}</ref>

=== C.E.B. ===
In 1991, Roney put his solo career aside to join [[hardcore hip hop]] group C.E.B. (which stood for "Countin' Endless Bank") with fellow Philadelphia rappers Warren McGlone ([[Steady B]]) and Ultimate Eaze. To disappointing sales and reviews, the trio released their only album, ''Countin' Endless Bank'', on [[Ruffhouse Records]] in 1993. The single "Get the Point" reached number 5 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot Rap Songs|Hot Rap Singles]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Hot Rap Singles: Get The Point |date=April 3, 1993 |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1993-04-03/rap-song |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524053805/http://www.billboard.com/charts/1993-04-03/rap-song |archivedate=May 24, 2014 }}</ref>

In 1992, an independent label, Rags to Riches Records, released the single "Get the Point." After extraordinary success with the single, Rags to Riches Records founders, Malik Abd-hadi and Bilal "bilally b" Salaam signed the trio Cool C, Steady B and Ultimate Eaze (C.E.B.) to Ruffhouse Records. At that point, Abd-hadi and Salaam became their managers. The project was short-lived mainly because Ultimate Eaze had legal troubles and never showed up for a promotional tour to promote the release of the first album on Ruffhouse. The group was dropped before Steady B, and Cool C got back off tour. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

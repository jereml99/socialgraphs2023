==Early life==
Fatal was born Bruce Edward Washington Jr. in New Jersey on April 3, 1973.<ref name=AJC_Death />

==Career==
Washington first appeared as "Hussein Fatal" in February 1996 on the songs "[[All Bout U (2Pac Song)|All Bout U]]" and "When We Ride" from Shakur's album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. As a member of the Outlaw Immortalz, his name was chosen to evoke a villain, Iraqi president [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/rappers-speak-on-the-nicknames-tupac-gave-them/

After Shakur was fatally shot in September 1996 and Outlawz member [[Yaki Kadafi]] was murdered in November, Washington did not appear on another recording until 1998 when [[Relativity Records]] released his first solo album ''[[In the Line of Fire (Hussein Fatal album)|In the Line of Fire]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=LegacyRecordings.com: Fatal In the Line of Fire |url=http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Fatal/In-The-Line-Of-Fire.aspx |website=[[Legacy Recordings]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712110434/http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Fatal/In-The-Line-Of-Fire.aspx |archive-date=2007-07-12 |url-status=unfit}}</ref> The label went bankrupt; the album wasn't promoted and sold poorly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.furious.com/perfect/relativityrecords.html|title=RELATIVITY RECORDS|access-date= May 8, 2022}}</ref>

Washington then signed with [[Rap-A-Lot Records]] and began work on a second solo studio album, ''Death Before Dishonor'', recording over 40 songs before being arrested in December 1999 for an assault committed three years earlier. Rap-A-Lot Records released the album as ''Fatal'' after he was paroled in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2paclegacy.net/hussein-fatal-fatal-official-album/|title=HUSSEIN FATAL ‚Äì FATAL (OFFICIAL ALBUM)|access-date= July 21, 2019}}</ref>

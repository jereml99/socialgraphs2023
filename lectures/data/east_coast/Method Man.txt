==Music career==
===1992–1996: ''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' and ''Tical''===
As Wu-Tang Clan ascended to hip hop stardom, Method Man was always one of the most visible members of the collective. He was one of only two members to get a solo song on the group's debut album ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'' and he was the first to release a solo album under the Clan's unusual contract which allowed its members to release albums under any [[record label]]. Method Man chose to sign with rap label [[Def Jam Recordings]], although [[Elektra Records]] A&R man [[Dante Ross]] initially wanted to sign him around the same time Ross signed fellow group member [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unkut.com/2009/04/dante-ross-the-unkut-interview-part-2-the-elektra-era/|title=Dante Ross – The Unkut Interview Part 2: The Elektra Era|website=Unkut.com|date=April 30, 2009 |access-date=January 12, 2019}}</ref> Method Man's solo debut, ''[[Tical (album)|Tical]]'' (1994), was critically acclaimed and well received, entering the American charts at #4 and eventually selling in excess of one million copies. That album featured the hit single "All I Need", later remixed featuring Mary J. Blige, which won a [[Grammy]] ("[[You're All I Need to Get By|I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need]]"). During this time Method Man also became close friends with fellow New York City-based rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], and was the only guest rapper featured on his debut album ''[[Ready to Die]]''. He was also featured on [[Spice 1]]'s album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Nightmare]]'' on the track "Hard 2 Kill". In 1995, he was also featured on "Got the Flava" off [[Showbiz and A.G.]]'s album ''[[Goodfellas (Show and A.G. album)|Goodfellas]]''. He also appeared on the [[Batman Forever (soundtrack)|Batman Forever]] soundtrack. His track, [[The Riddler (song)|The Riddler]], produced by [[RZA]] included a video with clips from the film. In 1996, Method Man appeared on [[Tupac Shakur]]'s album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'', on the song "Got My Mind Made Up" alongside his rhyme partner Redman, the Dogg Pound (Daz and Kurupt) and Inspectah Deck, whose verse did not make the released album version (although his nickname "Rebel INS" can be heard as the song fades). He was also featured on Redman's 1996 album ''Muddy Waters'' on the track "Do What Ya Feel".

===1997–1998: ''Wu-Tang Forever'' and ''Tical 2000: Judgment Day''===
On June 3, 1997, the Wu-Tang Clan released their Grammy-nominated multiplatinum double CD ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'', the long-awaited follow up to ''36 Chambers''. The album has sold over 2 million copies to date worldwide.

In 1996, the movie, [[Space Jam]] was released. Method Man, alongside [[LL Cool J]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[B-Real]] and [[Coolio]] released a song from the Space Jam Soundtrack called, [[Hit 'Em High (The Monstars' Anthem)|Hit 'em High]]. Method Man would go on to feature on LL Cool J's, [[4, 3, 2, 1 (LL Cool J song)|4,3,2,1]] the following year.

His second solo album was ''[[Tical 2000: Judgement Day]]'', released in 1998, which was heavily influenced by the [[apocalypse]] theories surrounding the forthcoming end of the millennium, and which featured myriad guest appearances from his fellow Wu-Tang MCs. The album was certified double platinum. Other guest appearances include [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Mobb Deep]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], and brief cameos from [[Russell Simmons]], [[Bishop Don "Magic" Juan]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alternet.org/2016/10/donald-trump-hip-hop-candidate/|title=Donald Trump: The Hip-Hop Candidate|last=by|date=October 12, 2016|website=Alternet.org|access-date=January 12, 2019}}</ref> The album sold better than his first fueled by the party track "Judgment Day" and the D'Angelo collaboration "Break Ups 2 Make Ups", earning Platinum and Gold certifications in the U.S. and Canada respectively. Reviews for the album were mixed and its long runtime and abundance of intermittent comedy skits were widely criticized. Producers on this album included [[True Master]], [[4th Disciple]] and the [[RZA]].

In 1997, Scottish rock band, [[Texas (band)|Texas]], had found some success with their single, "[[Say What You Want]]". In 1998, the band collaborated with Method Man and [[RZA]] on a remix of the song titled "Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)", with RZA producing. It was later included in the Greatest Hits album released by Texas.

===1999–2001: ''Blackout!'' (with Redman) and WWF Aggression===
Method Man was part of the very successful Hard Knock Life Tour with [[Jay-Z]], Redman, [[Ja Rule]], and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]. During this tour, [[Method Man & Redman]] recorded ''[[Blackout! (Method Man & Redman album)|Blackout!]]'', a light-hearted, bass-heavy, profanity-laced, party record with an [[EPMD]]-evoking emphasis on funky beats and the mischievous wit and cool flows and good rhythm of the two MCs. The album reached platinum status quickly, both in the U.S. and Canada, fueled by "Da Rockwilder", "Cereal Killa", "1, 2, 1, 2", "Tear It Off" and "Y.O.U." This album also featured three previously released tracks on which the two collaborated.

Their success would lead the duo on to star in movies and TV shows, become product spokespersons and household names, but also associated them with marijuana use in the media. The most immediate results of their success was their co-starring roles in the major motion picture film ''[[How High]]'', their endorsement deal for ''[[Right Guard]]'', Redman's starring role in ''[[Seed of Chucky]]'' and a short-lived sitcom on [[Fox Television]] entitled ''[[Method & Red]]''.

In 1999, Method Man featured on [[Limp Bizkit]]'s song "[[N 2 Gether Now]]" from their album ''[[Significant Other (album)|Significant Other]]''.

In 2000, Method Man performed Know Your Role which was included on the album titled, [[WWF Aggression]]. The song is focused on the popularity of professional wrestler at the time [[Dwayne Johnson]] whose wrestling name was 'The Rock' and the main line in the song is The Rock's most famous caption "Do you smell what The Rock is cookin'?".

===2001–2004: ''The W'', ''Iron Flag'', and ''Tical 0: The Prequel''===
The Wu-Tang Clan released ''[[The W]]'' on November 21, 2000, and [[Iron Flag]] on December 18, 2001. ''The W'' received both critical and commercial success for the group, while ''Iron Flag'' did receive some but not to the effect of ''The W''. The efforts earned two more platinum plaques for the Wu-Tang Clan.

In 2003, Method Man criticized [[Oli "Power" Grant]] and Mitchell "Divine" Diggs, the managers of the Wu-Tang Clan business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/4938 |title=Method Man Talks Beef With Wu & ODB |last=Amrstrong |first=Jego R. |date=August 13, 2003 |website=SOHH |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616111154/http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/4938 |archive-date=June 16, 2008}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2015}} "Number 1 on my shit list right now is Divine from Wu-Tang management.  He took something major from me that he had no intention of giving back."<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |last=Weiner |first=Jonah |date=November 2003 |title=Dear Superstar: Method Man |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=512 |website=Blender |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224023412/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=512 |archive-date=February 24, 2009}}</ref>

Aside from the financial issues, Method Man was unhappy with the decision to bring Wu-Tang into the fashion world for a brief period of time with Wu-Wear, despite the brand being a major money-maker for the group. "When Wu-Wear started making shoes and sneakers and pants, it was shoddy material. I never rocked that shit."<ref name="autogenerated2" />

In 2004, Meth released his third solo album ''[[Tical 0: The Prequel]]'', which featured the hit party single "[[What's Happenin']]" with [[Busta Rhymes]] and included guest appearances of pop-rap stars like [[Missy Elliott]] and [[P. Diddy]]. The album sold well and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] by the [[RIAA]] but did not see the platinum success of his previous solo releases.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

P. Diddy was one of the executive producers for the album, although Meth later voiced his displeasure with the final product. "On the third LP, it was suggested (by Def Jam) to bring in Harve Pierre and P. Diddy. Who am I to argue? Puff knows how to sell some records. But that wasn't the direction to go in, and I know that."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1533408/20060601/puff_daddy.jhtml |title=Method Man Drops Diddy, Seeks Clarity On New LP, 4:21 ...

===2006–2007: ''4:21... The Day After''===
[[File:Wu Tang Clan f7858007.jpg|thumb|Method Man at the 2007 [[Eurockéennes]]]]
Method Man's fourth album, entitled ''[[4:21|4:21: The Day After]]'' was released in August 2006 with a star lineup of producers featuring [[Havoc (Mobb Deep)|Havoc]], [[Erick Sermon]], [[Scott Storch]], [[Allah Mathematics]], [[Mr. Porter]], and, most importantly to Meth, RZA. This time around, a more focused Method Man went back to his hip hop roots and both hip hop fans and the media took notice. He did an interview on the ItsHipHop.Tv.<ref>[http://www.thebreakdown.tv/shows/thebreakdown/3/10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507091020/http://www.thebreakdown.tv/shows/thebreakdown/3/10|date=May 7, 2007}}</ref> Despite this being one of Meth's strongest solo efforts to date, the album failed to do well commercially due to it having no single or video, which Method Man has held discontent towards his own label for. However, he toured strongly all over the world to promote the album, and appeared onstage with fellow Wu-Tang member [[Inspectah Deck]], as well as New York up and comers [[Saigon (rapper)|Saigon]], and Gat Murdah. Meth cited various reasons for the problems between him and his label, Def Jam. While he puts most of the blame on personal agendas in the Def Jam offices, Meth did take some blame, himself, for giving in to his record label.

In early May 2007, Method Man's camp leaked the street single "New York New York" which became a popular track on the internet.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vozick |first=Simon |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20038258,00.html |title='New York' State of Mind |website=EW.com |date=May 10, 2007 |access-date=December 17, 2012}}</ref>

===2007–2010: ''Blackout! 2''===
On March 27, 2007, Redman confirmed on BET's ''Rap City: Tha Bassment'' that a sequel to ''How High'' is currently being written.

In an April 10, 2007, [[The A.V. Club|Onion A.V. Club]] interview,<ref>{{cite web |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/interview/redman |title=Redman &#124; Film &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

In early 2008, a remake of the Smooth da Hustler and Trigger tha Gambler classic ''Broken Language'' was released to the internet by the duo entitled ''Broken Language 2008'', fueling rumors of a ''Blackout!'' sequel coming soon. This rumor was further fueled by the duo while performing in [[Gainesville, Florida]] at the [[University of Florida]]. ''Blackout! 2'' was scheduled for a December 9, 2008, release but was pushed back to the first quarter of 2009, with a new release date of May 19, 2009. [[Bun B]] confirmed that he guest starred on ''Blackout! 2'' – in April 2009, a single was released titled "City Lights", produced by Nasty Kutt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/34825-bun-b-talks-about-the-final-ugk-album/ |title=Bun B Talks About the Final UGK Album |date=March 13, 2009 |publisher=Pitchfork |access-date=August 19, 2010}}</ref> Producers such as Erick Sermon, [[Rockwilder]] and [[Pete Rock]] also announced their presence on the album.

The duo has finished their ''Still High'' tour with Termanalogy, the Alchemist, and Evidence of Dilated Peoples.

===2011–present: ''The Meth Lab'' and ''Crystal Meth''===

The ''Crystal Meth'' album was first announced before Method Man began working on [[Method Man and Redman|his and Redman's]] second collaboration album, ''[[Blackout! 2]]'', during which time it was tentatively titled ''The Crystal Method''. In the liner notes of that album, it was given a scheduled release date for 2009. The album, however, was further postponed until it was later mentioned in an MTV interview it would be released in early 2010.<ref name="MTV"/> At a concert on December 23, 2010, Method Man told the crowd to look for his album in March 2011. However, the album was postponed again.

In an April 2011 interview with ''The Come Up Show'', following a recent performance in Canada, Method Man replied to a question regarding his "weed-loving" image: "When you get older and you've got kids and your kids are going to school and you know [their] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [you are] with your kids' education or well being, it's hard to sit there and be taken seriously if people are always talking about he's always high...which is totally not the case", he said. "When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn't care if the world knew. Now, I have to use more discretion because of my kids.

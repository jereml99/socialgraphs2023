In the late 1970s, he joined [[The Cold Crush Brothers]]. Caz admits that he himself stole new equipment during the [[New York City blackout of 1977]].<ref name="Slate podcast">{{cite news|last1=Mars|first1=Roman|last2=Hall|first2=Delaney|title=Was the 1977 New York City Blackout a Catalyst for Hip-Hop's Growth?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2014/10/16/roman_mars_99_percent_invisible_was_the_1977_nyc_wide_blackout_a_catalyst.html|date=October 16, 2014|access-date=October 21, 2014}}</ref>

=== Sugarhill Gang controversy ===
Grandmaster Caz is generally acknowledged to have been the main writer of the lyrics of [[Big Bank Hank]] (real name Henry Lee Jackson) on the 1979 [[The Sugarhill Gang]] single "[[Rapper's Delight]]", which sold around 5 million copies<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thesource.com/2020/09/16/today-in-hip-hop-history-sugar-hill-gang-releases-rappers-delight-41-years-ago/|title=Today In Hip-Hop History: Sugar Hill Gang Releases 'Rapper's Delight' 41 Years Ago|author=Sha Be Allah|publisher=[[The Source]]|date=September 16, 2020|accessdate=June 8, 2022}}</ref> and introduced hip hop music to the mainstream.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hess|first=Mickey|title=Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide: Volume 1: East Coast and West Coast|isbn=978-0-313-34323-0|publisher=Greenwood|year=2009}}</ref> Jackson had been Grandmaster Caz's manager, and was working at a pizza parlor when music executive [[Sylvia Robinson]] overheard him rapping Grandmaster Caz's lyrics, and asked him to be part of the group she was forming, The Sugarhill Gang. Jackson had never rapped before, and asked Caz for lyrics to use. This is most evident in his opening verse, when, instead of introducing himself as Big Bank Hank, he raps, "Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A-, N-O-V-A, and the rest is F-L-Y". (Casanova Fly is Grandmaster Caz's alternate moniker.)<ref name=wapo>{{cite news |title=They took Grandmaster Caz's rhymes without giving him credit.

In 2000, Caz released the song "MC Delight", a parody of "Rapper's Delight" which told his side of the story.<ref name=wapo /> In the song, Caz states about giving away his lyrics, "I gave it to him thinking/ Check books, credit cards, more money/ Than a sucker could ever spend/ But he never gave a nigga a god damn dime/ And was supposed to be my friend".<ref>[https://genius.com/Grandmaster-caz-mc-delight-lyrics Grandmaster Caz "MC Delight" Lyrics], Genius</ref>

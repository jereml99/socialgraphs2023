He was also known as the "Five-Foot Assassin" and "the Five-Footer", because he stood at {{convert|5|ft|3|in}}.

==Early life==
Phife Dawg was born Malik Izaak Taylor on November 20, 1970, in [[Queens]], [[New York City]], the son of [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] immigrant parents Cheryl Boyce-Taylor, a poet, and Walt Taylor.<ref name=hiphopdx>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1545/title.phife-dawg-his-name-is-mutty-ranks|title=Phife Dawg: His Name Is Mutty Ranks|date=May 16, 2010 |publisher=HipHopDX|access-date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>Coleman (2007), p. 435.</ref><ref name="ubuntu"/> Born prematurely, his twin brother Mikal died shortly after birth.<ref name="heavy"/> His mother settled in the [[St. Albans, Queens|St. Albans]] neighborhood of Queens, where Phife Dawg was raised, when she was 13 years old.<ref name="ubuntu">{{Cite news|url=https://ubuntubiographyproject.com/2017/12/06/cheryl-boyce-taylor/|title=Cheryl Boyce-Taylor|date=December 6, 2017|work=The Ubuntu Biography Project by Stephen A.

He first met his friend [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] at the age of two, and at nine years old, Phife Dawg suggested that they should rap, after hearing "[[Rapper's Delight]]" by [[the Sugarhill Gang]] for the first time.<ref name="beats">{{cite journal |last=Rapaport |first=Michael |title=[[Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest]] |journal=[[Sony Pictures Classics]] |date=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.44348/title.q-tip-gives-phife-dawg-ultimate-salute-during-atcqs-final-denver-show| title= Q-Tip Gives Phife Dawg Ultimate Salute During ATCQ's Final Denver Show| work= [[HipHopDX]]| date= August 11, 2017| first= Kyle| last= Eustice | access-date= December 25, 2021}}</ref> He attended [[Pine Forge Academy]], a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] boarding school near [[Philadelphia]], for his freshman year of high school, later transferring to [[Springfield Gardens High School]] in Queens.<ref>Coleman (2007), p. 436.</ref>

==Career==
Phife Dawg formed [[A Tribe Called Quest]], then simply named Quest, with Q-Tip and DJ [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] in 1985;<ref name="thesource">{{cite journal|last=Lewis |first=Miles |title=After the Love is Gone |journal=[[The Source]] |publisher=[[L. Londell McMillan]]|date=October 1998 }}</ref> the group was later expanded with the addition of [[Jarobi White]]. A Tribe Called Quest were closely associated with fellow hip-hop acts [[De La Soul]] and [[Jungle Brothers]], with the groups collectively known as the [[Native Tongues]].<ref name="avc">{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/r-i-p-malik-phife-dawg-taylor-co-founder-of-a-tribe-1798245583|title=R.I.P.

Phife Dawg's contributions to the group increased on its second album, 1991's ''[[The Low End Theory]]'', which saw Phife—often calling himself "the Five-Foot Assassin"—rapping about social and political issues; the record has since been acclaimed by critics and musicians.<ref name=avc/> The group released three more albums that decade—''[[Midnight Marauders]]'' in 1993, ''[[Beats, Rhymes and Life]]'' in 1996, and ''[[The Love Movement]]'' in 1998—before disbanding as a result of conflict both with their record label and internally. The group's troubles, especially the sometimes tense relationship between Phife and Q-Tip, were featured in the 2011 documentary ''[[Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest]]'', directed by [[Michael Rapaport]].<ref name=avc/>

Phife also performed with other artists. He was featured on the [[Fu-Schnickens]] song "[[La Schmoove]]", [[Diamond D]]'s "Painz & Strife" with [[Pete Rock]], and [[Chi-Ali]]'s "Let the Horns Blow" with [[Dres (rapper)|Dres]], [[The Beatnuts|Al' Tariq]] and [[David Jolicoeur|Trugoy]]. In 2000, he released his debut solo album, ''[[Ventilation: Da LP]]''. In 2013, it was reported that Phife was working on another solo album, ''MUTTYmorPHosis''.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Tribe Called Quest {{!}} Phife Dawg Pens Song Tribute To J.

==Legacy==
Phife has been described as having had a "self-deprecating swagger", and his work with A Tribe Called Quest helped challenge the "macho posturing" of rap and hip-hop music during the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref name=bbc/> Phife's work has been cited as an influence on [[Kanye West]], [[Jill Scott (singer)|Jill Scott]], [[The Roots]] and [[Common (rapper)|Common]],<ref name=avc/> while the 1991 album ''[[The Low End Theory]]'' is considered one of the greatest hip-hop albums ever.<ref name="bbc"/>

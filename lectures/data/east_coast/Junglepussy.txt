==Artistry==
===Musical style and influences===
In a 2014 interview with ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'', Junglepussy cited she has taken inspiration from musicians such as [[Erykah Badu]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Lady Saw]], [[Kelis]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Vybz Kartel]], [[Mavado (singer)|Mavado]], [[The Veronicas]], [[Metric (band)|Metric]], [[Gossip (band)|Gossip]], and [[Soulja Boy]].<ref name=interviewmagazine/>

===Public image===
Junglepussy explained that as a young woman she was mostly influenced by the television show ''[[Moesha]]'', starring singer/actress [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]]. She said in ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'': "Growing up, I would see Brandy on ''Moesha'' and see her keeping in her cornrows and her braids, but still flourish in her art and music, looking fly. I loved ''Moesha'' as a child, but now I take away something more special from it. Just because you're a black girl, it doesn't mean you need to only care about hair and makeup. Brandy cared about books, culture and where she was going — you can do both."<ref name=papermag>{{cite web|url=http://www.papermag.com/2014/06/junglepussy_satisfaction_guranteed.php|title=Why Junglepussy Is One of Rap's Brightest New Stars|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|first=Justin|last=Moran|date=June 20, 2014|access-date=May 8, 2019}}</ref>

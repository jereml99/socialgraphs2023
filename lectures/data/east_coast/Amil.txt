Amil's debut studio album, ''[[All Money Is Legal]]'' (2000), peaked at number 45 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and spawned two singles, "[[I Got That]]" (with vocals from [[Beyoncé]]) and "[[4 da Fam]]".

==Early life==
Amil was born on September 19, 1973 in [[New York City]].

==Career==
In 1997, Amil was a member of Major Coins, an all-female group. The group met [[Jay-Z]], who was looking for a woman to provide vocals on his third album, ''[[Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life]]''. Jay-Z asked Amil to [[freestyle rap|freestyle]] and liked it, and selected her for the role.<ref>{{cite web |last=Langhorne |first=Cyrus |url=http://www.sohh.com/2011/08/amil_still_loves_the_jigga_man_i_wish_i.html |title=Amil Still Loves The Jigga Man, "I Wish I Could Talk To Jay-Z Because That Would Bring Closure" |publisher=Sohh.Com |date=August 19, 2011 |access-date=March 30, 2012 |archive-date=September 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920091824/http://www.sohh.com/2011/08/amil_still_loves_the_jigga_man_i_wish_i.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

When Major Coins broke up, Amil decided to follow a solo career with Jay-Z's label, [[Roc-A-Fella Records]], and joined the 1999 Hard Knock Life Tour. After the tour, she appeared on songs with [[Mariah Carey]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[DJ Kay Slay]], [[LL Cool J]], and [[Funkmaster Flex]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Potts |first=Diana |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/amil-p413732/biography |title=Amil |publisher=AllMusic |date=September 27, 2000 |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amil?noanv=1#t=Credits_All&q=&p=1 |title=Amil Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref>

She has appeared on Jay-Z songs such as "[[Nigga What, Nigga Who]]", "[[Can I Get A...]]", "[[Do It Again (Put Ya Hands Up)]]", "S Carter", "You, Me, Him and Her", and "Pop 4 Roc".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/All-Money-Legal-Amil/dp/B00004WK44/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1315995882&sr=8-1 |title=All Money Is Legal: Amil: Music |website=Amazon |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> In August 2000, Amil released her debut solo album, ''[[All Money Is Legal]]''. The album featured the single "[[I Got That]]", a duet with Beyoncé,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xcm2i|title=Amil – I Got That ft. Beyoncé Knowles – Video Dailymotion |publisher=Dailymotion.com |date=April 24, 2011 |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> and All-Star Roc-A-Fella single  "[[4 Da Fam]]". The album also featured Jay-Z, [[Memphis Bleek]], [[Carl Thomas (singer)|Carl Thomas]], [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]], and [[Beanie Sigel]].

Album sales were disappointing, and the singles did not sell well either. Following that album, her last Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam single, "[[Hey Papi]]", a song from the soundtrack to the feature film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', was released. In 2002, Amil had a small role in ''[[State Property (film)|State Property]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301893/fullcredits#cast|title=State Property (2002) : Full Cast & Crew|website=IMDb.com|access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref>

==Biography==

===1976–1997: Early life and career beginnings===
Giles was born and raised in the [[East Harlem]] neighborhood of [[Upper Manhattan, New York City]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0SUEAAAAMBAJ | magazine = Vibe | title = Harlem Knight | last = Meadows-Ingram | first = Benjamin | date = August 2002 | access-date = March 20, 2020}}</ref> He was raised by his mother, Fredericka Giles (July 10, 1955 – February 9, 2023). He went to school at the [[Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics]], where he met his longtime friends [[Mase]] and [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]]. He was a promising basketball player alongside Mase; however, he was unable to take advantage of scholarship offers due to his poor academic standing. Instead, he enrolled in a college in Texas, without even graduating from high school, but soon dropped out and returned to Harlem where he began selling drugs before starting his rap career. Giles was eventually introduced to [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] through his childhood friend Mase. B.I.G. introduced Giles to [[Lance Rivera]], who signed him to his label, Untertainment.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/LNLFPmnL6H0 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131209061956/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNLFPmnL6H0 Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNLFPmnL6H0 |title=Cam'ron StreetHeat Interview|website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1004112/bio|title=Cam'ron|website=IMDb|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref>

He began his musical career in the mid-1990s, rapping alongside [[Big L (rapper)|Big L]], Mase, and his cousin Bloodshed, in a group called [[Children of the Corn (group)|Children of the Corn]]. After Bloodshed's death in a car accident on March 2, 1997, the group disbanded and the remaining members pursued solo careers.

===1998–2002: ''Confessions of Fire'', ''S.D.E.'' and ''Come Home with Me''===
Two years before Big L's murder in 1999, Cam'ron was introduced to [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] by Mase who was signed to [[Bad Boy Records]] at the time. Biggie was so impressed by Cam'ron that he introduced him to his partner Lance "Un" Rivera who signed Cam'ron to his Untertainment label, distributed by Epic Records. His debut album, ''Confessions of Fire'', was released a year later in July 1998 and included singles such as "3-5-7" (which was also featured in the movie [[Woo (film)|Woo]]), and "Horse and Carriage" featuring Mase, which reached the R&B Top Ten. The album achieved gold status and made the Top 10 of both the pop and R&B charts.

In 2000, Cam'ron was working with music executive [[Tommy Mottola]] and released his second album ''[[S.D.E.|S.D.E. (Sports Drugs & Entertainment)]]'' on Sony/Epic Records. With features from [[Destiny's Child]], [[Juelz Santana]], Jim Jones, [[N.O.R.E.]], and producer Digga, it included the relatively successful singles, "Let Me Know" and "What Means The World To You". The album reached Number 2 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and Number 14 on the Billboard 200.

It included the hit singles "[[Oh Boy (Cam'ron song)|Oh Boy]]" and "[[Hey Ma (Cam'ron song)|Hey Ma]]", which both featured [[the Diplomats]] newest member [[Juelz Santana]]. The album achieved platinum status and served as a stepping stone for Cam'ron's group the Diplomats to sign with Roc-A-Fella.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/3520578/a/Come+Home+With+Me.htm |title = Cam'ron - Come Home With Me Album}}</ref>

===Sports Commentary===
In 2023, Cam'ron launched an independently-produced sports' news talk show, called ''It is What It is.'' Cam'ron's co-host on the show is rapper, [[Mase]]. The show's first episode premiered on February 27, 2023 on YouTube. In the months proceeding the show's launch, it has achieved viral success on the internet.

==Controversies==

===Jay-Z===
Although there had been rumors of a feud between the two emcees, Cam'ron went public first with a track on "Killa Season" called "You Gotta Love It (Jay-Z Diss)" featuring ex-Dipset member [[Max B]]. In the song, Cam'ron takes jabs at Jay-Z's age, his alleged "biting" (stealing) of lyrics, and his current girlfriend. He references Jay-Z using [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s rhymes, rapping "You ain't the only one with big wallets got it my shit's brolick but ya publishing should go to Miss Wallace." He then released another song "Swagger Jacker (Biter Not a Writer)" to highlight the many songs Jay-Z has borrowed lines from. In the next issue of [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]], Cam'ron explained the beef originated when Jay-Z became CEO and President of [[Roc-A-Fella Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nahright.com/news/2006/01/18/cam-finally-disses-hov/|title=Cam Finally Disses Hov - Nah Right|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref> In 2010, Cam'ron stated he does not have any issues with Jay-Z anymore.

In 2013, on "Pound Cake", a song by [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], Jay-Z mentioned Cam'ron again by rapping (in the middle of a verse): 
{{cquote|Now here's the icing on the cake/ Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh/ I'm just getting started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch/ I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did/ [[Damon Dash|Dame]] made millions, Bigg made millions/ [[Kanye West|Ye]] made millions, [[Just Blaze|Just]] made millions/ [[Lyor Cohen|Lyor]] made millions, Cam made millions/ [[Beanie Sigel|Beans]] would tell you if he wasn't in his feelin[g]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.25626/title.cam-ron-refutes-jay-z-s-pound-cake-claims|title=Cam'ron Refutes Jay Z's "Pound Cake" Claims|author=HipHopDX|date=2 October 2013|work=HipHopDX|access-date=11 March 2015}}</ref>}}

Cam replied briefly on "Come and Talk to Me" off of ''Ghetto Heaven Vol. 1'':
{{cquote|She said Jay made you a millionaire? and looked me in the eyes/ Said cake, cake, cake, got that from the pies/ We made each other millions, that was my reply/ had a mill before I met him, baby, that ain't no lie/ See he named some Harlem cats and the [[Kanye West|homie from the Chi]] / but my thing, he ain't name nobody from the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant|Stuy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddotomen.com/2013/09/30/camron-come-and-talk-to-me-jay-z-response/|title=New Music: Cam'Ron 'Come And Talk To Me' (Jay Z Response) - DDotOmen|access-date=11 March 2015}}</ref>
}}

On April 26, 2019, he and Jay-Z ended their feud at the re-opened [[Webster Hall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/jay-z-brings-out-nas-camron-jim-jones-at-iconic-webster-hall-re-opening-news.78514.html|title=Jay-Z Brings Out Nas, Cam'ron, Jim Jones At Iconic Webster Hall Re-Opening|website=HotNewHipHop|date=April 27, 2019|access-date=July 22, 2020}}</ref>

===50 Cent===
On February 1, 2007, Cam'ron and [[50 Cent]] had a live argument on ''The [[Angie Martinez]] Show'' on [[WQHT|Hot 97]] radio. 50 Cent commented that he felt [[Koch Entertainment]] was a "graveyard", meaning major record labels would not work with their artists.<ref name=NYT>Sanneh, Kelefa (February 27, 2007). Rappers Find That a Small Label Can Have Its Uses. ''The New York Times''. Accessed May 22, 2007.</ref> Cam'ron then ridiculed the record sales of [[G-Unit]] members [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Mobb Deep]] by pointing out that [[The Diplomats|Dipset]] member [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]] outsold both of their albums despite not being signed to a major label, and also went on to clarify that his group, The Diplomats, had a distribution deal from several labels.<ref name="NYT"/> Both rappers released diss songs with videos on [[YouTube]]. 50 Cent released "Funeral Music", and suggested in the song that Cam'ron is no longer able to lead The Diplomats and that Jim Jones should take his place. Cam'ron responded with "Curtis" and "Curtis Pt. II", in which he makes fun of 50 Cent's appearance, calling him "a gorilla, with rabbit teeth". 50 Cent responded by releasing "[[Hold On (Young Buck song)|Hold On]]" with [[Young Buck]]. Since 2009, the feud slowly died down, and they eventually reconciled in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BI50XSmAoci/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/s/instagram/BI50XSmAoci |archive-date=December 26, 2021 |url-access=registration|title=50 Cent on Instagram: "I said Cam I would talk to you like you ain't got money, if I didn't see them big ass knot's in ya pockets."|website=Instagram|access-date=May 16, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===Jim Jones===
Cam'ron revealed in 2007 that he was no longer speaking to his fellow Diplomat members Juelz Santana and Jim Jones, leading to speculation that the group had officially broken up. However, despite admitting that he did not want to contact Jim Jones, he said that he had no hard feelings towards him. In an interview with Miss Info, Cam'ron said: "I still haven't spoken to Jim. But Jim ran with me for over 10 years, he worked hard, and I wish him the best of luck. Everybody thinks I'm mad at Jim. Why am I mad? I told people for years that Jimmy was gonna be a star. So it's better on my resume. I wish him the best."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5911/title.camron-addresses-jim-jones-50-cent-his-hiatus-more |title=Cam Speaks on Hiatus|date=November 2, 2007}}</ref> After three years of not speaking, Cam'ron and Jim Jones mended their differences in April 2010. In late 2011, both appeared together on [[Wolfgang Gartner]]'s album ''[[Weekend in America]]'', on the track "Circus Freaks".

===Stop Snitchin'===
On April 22, 2007, Cam'ron was interviewed on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' as part of a piece on the [[Stop Snitchin']] movement.<ref name="60min">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/19/60minutes/main2704565.shtml |title=Stop Snitchin' - 60 Minutes |work=CBS News |date=August 12, 2007 |access-date=February 27, 2011}}</ref> He also stated that he would "not help the police" try to locate the shooter saying he is "not a snitch" and helping the police would probably hurt his record sales. He stated in the interview, "Because with the type of business I'm in, it would definitely hurt my business. And the way that I was raised, I just don't do that. I was raised differently, not to tell... It's about business but it's still also a code of ethics" When asked by [[Anderson Cooper]] if he would tell the police if a serial killer was living next to him, Cam'ron replied "I would probably move" but would not inform the police.

Cam'ron later issued an apology for his comments, calling them an "error in judgement":<ref name="60min" /> "Where I come from, once word gets out that you've cooperated with the police that only makes you a bigger target of criminal violence. That is a dark reality in so many neighborhoods like mine across America. I'm not saying its right, but its reality. And it's not unfounded. There's a harsh reality around violence and criminal justice in our inner cities." Cam'ron has had contact with the police in the past. According to [[The Smoking Gun]], New York Police Department records indicate that Giles filed a report with police after he was assaulted at a park in Harlem in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0419072giles1.html|title=Rapper's Change Of Face|work=The Smoking Gun|date=October 20, 2014|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref>

===Kanye West===
Both Cam'ron and Jim Jones took out their frustrations on former label-mate Kanye West in defense of former CEO Dame Dash (due to their longtime friendship dating back to growing up in Harlem)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/06/03/camron-fact-interview-diplomats-a-trak-drugs/|title="I didn't grow up in a musical family, I grew up in a drug family": Cam'ron talks Paid in Full, A-Trak and the cult of Dipset - FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|work=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|date=June 3, 2014|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref> by releasing a song titled "Toast" rhyming over Kanye West's song "[[Runaway (Kanye West song)|Runaway]]". The feud eventually ended, evidenced by Cam'ron, Jim Jones, and Kanye West collaborating on a song called "[[G.O.O.D. Fridays|Christmas in Harlem]]".

==Personal life==
On October 23, 2005, Cam'ron was leaving a nightclub in Washington D.C., having performed the day before at [[Howard University]]. While stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of New York and New Jersey Avenue shortly after midnight, a passenger of a nearby car threatened Cam'ron to "give up" his 2006 [[Lamborghini]]. Cam'ron resisted, and the man then shot him. Cam'ron was struck at least once as he was holding the steering wheel, but he was able to drive, going the wrong way on streets and flashing his lights, until a fan drove him to Howard University Hospital. The gunman and passenger drove off, crashed into a parked car, and fled the scene. D.C. Metro Police recovered a cell phone from the scene of the crash, which they tried to use to trace the suspects. He stated that he does not know who shot him, although later, in the song "Gotta Love It" featuring [[Max B]], Cam'ron claims that he saw the gunman throw up the [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] diamond hand signal before shots were fired.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102301334.html|title=Rapper Shot in Alleged Carjacking in D.C.|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://globalgrind.com/4284644/roc-back-jay-z-ends-20-year-beef-with-camron-but-heres-how-it-started-in-the-first-place/|title= Roc Back: Jay-Z Ends 20-Year Beef With Cam'ron — But Here's How It Started In The First Place|date= April 27, 2019|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>

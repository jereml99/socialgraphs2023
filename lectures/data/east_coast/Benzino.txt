== Career ==
Benzino has said one of the primary inspirations to enter the genre of rap stems from his fondness of the film ''Wild Style.''<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://musicblissinterviews.wixsite.com/music-bliss/benzino | title = Music Bliss Hip Hop Interviews Done Right |access-date=January 10, 2018 | language = en}}</ref>

Benzino was a founding member of rap groups [[the Almighty RSO]] and [[Made Men]]. He has appeared on the [[reality television]] show ''[[Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta]]'', since 2012.

=== Feud with Eminem ===
Benzino is known for being involved since 2002 in a widely publicized feud with rapper [[Eminem]]; the feud began after his ''The Source'' magazine rated ''[[The Eminem Show]]'' as four mics out of five. Eminem blamed the magazine and its co-founder Benzino for what he considered an unfair rating. Benzino  even refused to help promote his movie ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' during his performance in Puerto Rico. Benzino later released [[diss track]]s towards Eminem, titled "Pull Your Skirt Up" (calling him "2003 [[Vanilla Ice]]")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.distractify.com/p/benzino-eminem-beef|title = A Breakdown of Benzino and Eminem's Heated Feud|date = October 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Dukes | first = Rahman | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458854/benzino-eminem-got-beef.jhtml | title = Benzino Ignites Beef By Calling Eminem '2003 Vanilla Ice' – Music, Celebrity, Artist News | publisher = MTV.com | date = November 22, 2002 | access-date = July 23, 2012}}</ref> and "Die Another Day", while Eminem released "The Sauce" and "Nail in the Coffin".<ref>{{cite magazine | first = Jenny | last = Eliscu | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/benzino-eminem-feud-heats-up-20030103 | title = Benzino, Eminem Feud Heats Up &#124; Music News | magazine = Rolling Stone | date = January 3, 2003 | access-date = July 23, 2012}}</ref> As a continuation of this animosity between the two, Benzino released the diss mixtape ''Benzino Presents: Die Another Day: Flawless Victory'', further disparaging Eminem.<ref>{{cite web | last = Cantor | first = Paul | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1649935/rapper-huddy-6-killed-car-accident.jhtml | title = Rapper Huddy 6 Killed In Car Accident – Music, Celebrity, Artist News

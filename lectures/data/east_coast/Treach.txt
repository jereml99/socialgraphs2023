=== Legal issues ===
Treach was arrested in [[Union City, New Jersey]], on April 10, 2014. He allegedly passed traffic police in his [[Cadillac Escalade]] at 55 miles per hour in a 25-mile per hour zone and attempted to elude law enforcement officers after being given a signal to stop, leading them on a high-speed chase for nine blocks before stopping. He then left his vehicle and ran towards the police car; the officers drew their weapons and ordered him to return to his vehicle. Treach later complied with the officers' orders and was cited for reckless driving, speeding and driving with a suspended license. Officers also found there was a warrant for his arrest out of [[Essex County, New Jersey]], for failing to appear at a hearing related to child support, and warrants out of Union City and [[Secaucus, New Jersey]], for failing to appear at hearings related to motor vehicle violations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/04/anthony_criss_of_hip_hop_group_naughty_by_nature_arrested_in_union_city.html|title=Anthony 'Treach' Criss of hip hop group Naughty by Nature arrested in Union City|work=NJ.com|date=April 11, 2014|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> He made his first court appearance on the charge in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], on April 11 and spent the night in [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] jail in [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]] before being released after posting $15,000 bail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/04/anthony_treach_criss_of_hip_hop_group_naughty_by_nature_released_from_hudson_county_jail.html|title=Naughty by Nature member 'Treach' Criss released from Hudson jail|work=NJ.com|date=April 15, 2014|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref>

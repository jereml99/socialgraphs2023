== Early life ==

David R. Styles was born November 28, 1974, in [[Corona, Queens]], New York City, to a South African mother and a Jamaican father from [[Bed-Stuy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.last.fm/music/Styles+P/+wiki |title=Style P Bio |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Last.fm |publisher= CBS Corporation}}</ref> After his parents' divorce, Styles and his younger brother Gary moved to [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] with their mother. It was there he met lifelong friends [[Jadakiss]] and [[Sheek Louch]]. The trio bonded over their shared passion for [[hip hop]] and eventually formed a group known as [[the Lox]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1995400/bio|title=Styles P.|website=IMDb|access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref><ref name="complex1">{{cite web|last=Ortiz |first=Edwin |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/01/jadakiss-unhinged-the-combat-jack-show |title=Jadakiss Talks About Growing Up In Yonkers and The LOX's Relationship with Mary J.

== Career ==
=== 1994–2000: The Lox ===
[[File:Jadakiss Styles P.jpg|thumb|Styles P (left) performing with [[Jadakiss]]]]
As a trio, the Lox began rapping in the mid-1990s and started to build a steady underground following thanks to their performances and street freestyles. In their late teens, the trio met [[Mary J. Blige]] who was impressed with their lyrical content, and gave their demo to [[Sean Combs|Sean "Diddy" Combs]].<ref name="complex1" /> Diddy immediately hired the trio to write for [[Bad Boy Records]]. After signing with Bad Boy, the Lox quickly started collaborating on hits with Diddy, [[the Notorious B.I.G.]], Mary J. Blige and [[Mariah Carey]] which gave them instant notoriety and status within the hip-hop and mainstream charts.<ref name="complex1" /> In 1996 and 1997, the group wrote and performed on a number of Diddy hits, including "[[It's All About the Benjamins]]" and "I Got the Power", [[Mase]]'s "[[24 Hrs. to Live]]", Mariah Carey's "[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]]", the Notorious B.I.G.'s "Last Day" and Mary J. Blige's "Can't Get You Off My Mind".<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|author=Vibe |url=http://www.vibe.com/photo-galleries/story-time-sheek-louch-recalls-studio-sessions-dmx-biggie-jay-z |title=Story Time: Sheek Louch Recalls Studio Sessions With DMX, Biggie & Jay-Z |publisher=Vibe |date=September 28, 2010 |access-date=August 14, 2015}}</ref> In 1997, the Lox received international acclaim when their tribute to the late Biggie Smalls, "We'll Always Love Big Poppa", was picked as the B-side track from Diddy's ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]'' album (3× Platinum) with the number one hit, "[[I'll Be Missing You]]".<ref name="autogenerated1" /> This single was the most played hit in 1997, which opened the door for the Lox's to write more of their own songs and eventually release their first album in January 1998 titled ''[[Money, Power & Respect]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/money-power-respect-mw0000031595 |title=Money, Power & Respect – The LOX &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=January 13, 1998 |access-date=August 14, 2015}}</ref> The album went on to be certified platinum, and, although the album was a chart-topping success, the group grew to feel that the glossy image and production style of Bad Boy Records conflicted with their grimier rap aesthetic. After trying and failing to get [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]] to grant them a release from their contract, the group confronted him in his office, with Styles P throwing a chair at his own boss. After this, the group was granted their release and left Bad Boy to sign with [[Ruff Ryders Entertainment|Ruff Ryder Records]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/23/entertainment/ca-56625 |title=More Grime Than Shine, the LOX Moves On – latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=October 14, 2006 |access-date=August 14, 2015 |first=Soren |last=Baker}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLaUUWHA5q0  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/NLaUUWHA5q0 |archive-date=December 13, 2021 |url-status=live|title=Jadakiss Recalls Styles P Throwing A Chair At Diddy So "The LOX" Could Leave Bad Boy Records |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=March 12, 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In 1994, The Fugees recorded their first album ''[[Blunted on Reality]]'', under the supervision of Ronald Khalis Bell. Before and during this, Pras attended [[Rutgers University]] and [[Yale University]], pursuing a double major in Philosophy and Psychology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dajaz1.com/pras-talks-2pac-suge-knight-wyclef-lauryn-hill-beef-on-the-champs-podcast/|title=Pras Talks 2Pac, Suge Knight, Wyclef, Lauryn Hill & Beef on the Champs Podcast| website= Dajaz1.com |author=Rahul|date=May 17, 2012|access-date=May 19, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130120072117/http://dajaz1.com/pras-talks-2pac-suge-knight-wyclef-lauryn-hill-beef-on-the-champs-podcast/|archive-date=January 20, 2013}}</ref> In 1996, The Fugees achieved historic crossover success with ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'', which went multi-platinum.

Pras has also forged a successful solo career, beginning with an international hit single from his first full-length solo LP, "[[Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are)]]", featuring [[Mýa]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. "Ghetto Superstar" became a top ten single in 1999, and the eighth most played single. The song earned Pras a performance at the [[World Music Awards]]. The hit single was included in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Bulworth]]''. "Ghetto Supastar" spent eight weeks in the UK Top 5, peaking at No. 2 in July 1998,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

"Blue Angels", from the same album, was a UK Top 10 hit, reaching No. 6 in November.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" />

Pras also featured on the track "Turn You On" by Swedish artist [[Denise Lopez (Swedish singer)|DeDe]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dede.se/|title=Denise Lopez|website=Dede.se}}</ref> which was released in 2007.

He also featured "Pushin'" from the album ''[[Equalize]]'' by [[Swami (band)|Swami]], which was released in 2007.

=== Film ===
After his [[cameo appearance|cameo]] debut in the 1999 feature film ''[[Mystery Men]]'', Pras gained an interest in Hollywood. In 2000, Pras starred in the [[New Line]] film, ''[[Turn It Up (film)|Turn It Up]].'' In early 2002, he appeared in the Sony and Urban World release ''Higher Ed,'' and ''[[Go for Broke (2002 film)|Go for Broke]]'' in which he starred and produced. He also co-starred in three [[20th Century Fox]] films in 2007. These included ''[[The Mutant Chronicles]]''.

In 2006, Pras created ''Skid Row, Los Angeles'', a documentary account of his nine-day experience posing as a homeless person living in [[Skid Row, Los Angeles, California|downtown Los Angeles]]. Using a hidden camera, Pras captured the reality of homelessness. The film was produced by Teryn Fogel.<ref name="Skid Row IMDB">{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795381/ | title= Skid Row| website= IMDb.com | date= August 24, 2007| access-date=December 4, 2010 | publisher= Internet Movie Database}}</ref> ''Skid Row'' was released on August 24, 2007.<ref name="Skid Row, 83% Rotten Tomatoes">{{ cite web | url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10008747-skid_row/ | title=Skid Row | website= RottenTomatoes.com | date=March 25, 2008 | access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 2009, Pras travelled to [[Somalia]] to film the documentary ''Paper Dreams'' which examines [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|piracy off the African coast]]. During filming, pirates invaded the ship he was on, the ''[[MV Maersk Alabama]]'', and took the captain of the ship hostage. Due to be released in 2014, the documentary remains unfinished due to a legal dispute.<ref name="TMZ Fugees Rapper Pras Michel Sues">{{cite web | url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/12/02/the-fugees-pras-michel-lawsuit-somalia-pirate-footage-held-hostage/ |title=TMZ Pras Michel Lawsuit | access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 2015, Pras completed a documentary, ''Sweet Micky For President'', which chronicles the rise of Haitian musician [[Michel Martelly]], through his election to fight corruption as President of Haiti, an election campaign that was strongly endorsed by Pras. The film had its world premiere at the 2015 [[Slamdance Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/video/documentary-sweet-micky-president-123408797.html|title=Documentary: 'Sweet Micky for President' |website=Yahoo News|access-date=March 21, 2016}}</ref>

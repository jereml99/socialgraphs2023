'''Antonio Hardy''' (born September 10, 1968), better known by his stage name '''Big Daddy Kane''', is an American [[Rapping|rapper]], producer and actor who began his career in 1986 as a member of the [[Juice Crew]]. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and skilled [[MC]]s in [[hip hop]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked his song "[[Ain't No Half-Steppin']]" number 25 on its list of ''The 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time'', calling him "a master wordsmith of rap's late-[[Golden age hip hop|golden age]] and a huge influence on a generation of MCs".

==Biography==

===1980s===
In 1984, Kane became friends with [[Biz Markie]], and he would co-write some of Biz's best-known lyrics.<ref name="BDK interview"/><ref>Coleman, Brian, 2007, ''[[Check the Technique]]: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies''. New York:Villard/Random House, p. 47.</ref> Both eventually became important members of the [[Queens]]-based Juice Crew, a collective headed by renowned producer [[Marley Marl]]. Kane signed with Tyrone Williams's (Marl's manager) and Len Fichtelberg's [[Cold Chillin' Records]] label in 1987 and debuted the same year with the 12" single "Raw", which was an underground hit. The name Big Daddy Kane came from a variation on [[Kwai Chang Caine|Caine]], [[David Carradine]]'s character from the TV show ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' (1972–1975), and a character called "Big Daddy" whom [[Vincent Price]] played in the film ''[[Beach Party]]'' (1963).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://halftimeonline.net/portfolio/big-daddy-kane/ |title=::Halftimeonline.net &#124; Big Daddy Kane &#124; Hip Hop Icon Series interview :: |publisher=Halftimeonline.net |access-date=September 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304230433/http://halftimeonline.net/portfolio/big-daddy-kane/ |archive-date=March 4, 2014 }}</ref>

Kane is known for his ability to syncopate over faster hip hop beats, and despite his asthmatic condition,<ref name="BDK interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1597/title.big-daddy-kane-rap-like-no-equal |title=Big Daddy Kane: Rap Like No Equal &#124; Rappers Talk Hip Hop Beef & Old School Hip Hop |publisher=HipHop DX |date=September 20, 2010 |access-date=May 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121053653/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1597/title.big-daddy-kane-rap-like-no-equal |archive-date=January 21, 2012 }}</ref> he is acknowledged as one of the pioneering masters of fast rhyming. His sense of style is renowned and set a number of late-1980s and early-1990s hip hop trends ([[Hi-top fade|high-top fades]] hairstyles, velour suits, and four-finger rings). The [[backronym]] "King Asiatic Nobody's Equal" is often applied to his moniker.

He released his debut album on Cold Chillin' Records in the early summer of 1988 called ''[[Long Live the Kane]]'', which featured the hit "[[Ain't No Half Steppin']]". The following year, Kane released his second album and biggest hit to date, ''[[It's a Big Daddy Thing]]'', which included 1970s sample throwbacks like "[[Smooth Operator (Big Daddy Kane song)|Smooth Operator]]" and the [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]]-produced track "I Get the Job Done", which hit the R&B top 40 during the closing of the 1980s. He also had a memorable verse on the [[Marley Marl]]-produced track "[[The Symphony (song)|The Symphony]]" released in late 1988, which included Juice Crew members Craig G, [[Masta Ace]], and [[Kool G Rap]].

===1990s===
[[File:Big Daddy Kane-03.jpg|thumb|upright|Big Daddy Kane in 1998]]
Big Daddy Kane appeared on [[Patti LaBelle]]'s 1991 effort, "Burnin{{'"}}. He provided the rap chorus to the single "Feels Like Another One". He also appeared on the video release "Live in New York".

He contributed the song "'Nuff Respect" to [[Juice (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] of [[Ernest Dickerson]]'s feature film debut ''[[Juice (1992 film)|Juice]]'', which starred [[Omar Epps]] and [[Tupac Shakur]], further demonstrating his fast lyrical delivery.

In 1991, Kane won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for his performance on the [[Quincy Jones]] collaborative track "Back on the Block" from the [[Back on the Block|album of the same name]].

Widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers during the [[golden age hip hop|golden age of hip hop]], Kane's experimentation with [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] beats and his alignment to the [[The Nation of Gods and Earths|Five Percent Nation]] drew criticism.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} Later albums, such as ''[[Looks Like a Job For...]]'', were acclaimed, but he was never able to return to the commercial and artistic success of ''It's a Big Daddy Thing''. However, he still tours extensively.

As an actor, he debuted in [[Mario Van Peebles]]' 1993 western ''[[Posse (1993 film)|Posse]]'', and appeared in [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Meteor Man (film)|The Meteor Man]]''. He also posed for ''[[Playgirl]]'' and [[Madonna]]'s book ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'' during the 1990s.

During the early 1990s, [[Jay-Z]] toured with Kane, and Kane helped him early on in his career. Ice-T says: "I actually met Jay-Z with Kane. Kane brought Jay-Z over to my house."<ref name="mtv.com">{{cite web|date=March 9, 2006|title=The Greatest MCs Of All Time|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index5.jhtml|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012123716/http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index5.jhtml|archive-date=October 12, 2013|access-date=September 5, 2009|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref>
Kane himself says that Jay-Z was not technically his hypeman in the true sense of the term: "he wasn't a hypeman, he basically made cameo appearances on stage. When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unkut.com/2007/09/big-daddy-kane-the-unkut-interview/ |title=Big Daddy Kane – The Unkut Interview &#124; unkut.com – A Tribute To Ignorance (Remix) |date=September 7, 2007 |publisher=unkut.com |access-date=September 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018081340/http://www.unkut.com/2007/09/big-daddy-kane-the-unkut-interview/ |archive-date=October 18, 2009 }}</ref>
Jay-Z was also featured on Big Daddy Kane's track "Show & Prove" from ''Daddy's Home'' (1994), as well as in the video.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r207200|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( Daddy's Home > Overview ))) |publisher=allmusic |date=September 13, 1994 |access-date=September 5, 2009}}</ref>

In 1995, Kane recorded with [[MC Hammer]] and [[Tupac Shakur]] on the rap song "Too Late Playa" (along with [[Danny Boy (singer)|Danny Boy]]). He was also mentioned to signing with [[Death Row East]] in 1996.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} In 1997, Kane teamed up with [[Frankie Cutlass]] on his third single title "The Cypher Part 3" and some of [[Marley Marl]] [[Juice Crew]] veterans. In 1998, he released his final solo album to date, ''[[Veteranz' Day]]''. It received mixed reviews and did not sell well. However, Kane did not give up rapping and made many appearances in the 2000s.

===2000s===
In 2000, Big Daddy Kane appeared on Tony Touch's "[[The Piece Maker]]" mixtape alongside [[Kool G Rap]] and [[KRS-One]]. A rejuvenated Kane occasionally collaborated with a variety of hip-hop artists, including [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Jurassic 5]], [[Little Brother (band)|Little Brother]], and [[DJ Babu]] of the [[Beat Junkies]]. He released two singles, the [[The Alchemist (musician)|Alchemist]]-produced "The Man, The Icon", and the [[DJ Premier]]-produced "Any Type of Way" (on which he discusses urban collapse in post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] New York City ("[[Rudy Giuliani|Giuliani]] got New York lookin' like it's [[La Amistad|Amistad]]")) and the erosion of the [[middle class]].

Big Daddy Kane appeared on the [[trip hop]] group [[Morcheeba]]'s 2003 single "What's Your Name".

In 2005, Big Daddy Kane was honored during the [[VH1]] Hip-Hop Honors.

In 2006, he appeared as a guest MC on the track "Get Wild Off This", produced by the [[Stanton Warriors]] for their ''Stanton Sessions Vol. 2'' breaks mix. He also appeared alongside the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Rakim]], and his longtime friends [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] in a segment of the 2006 [[Summer Jam (festival)|Summer Jam]] concert (June 7, 2006), as part of an initiative by Busta Rhymes to honor the legacy of New York City hip-hop.

In 2007, a new track, "BK Mentality", was released on the mixtape compilation ''Official Joints''. Kane also appeared on [[Joell Ortiz]]'s ''[[The Brick: Bodega Chronicles]]'' mixtape.

Big Daddy Kane made a cameo in the 2008 video for "[[Game's Pain]]", a track by rapper [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]]. The video also featured appearances by [[Raekwon]], [[Three 6 Mafia]] and [[Ice Cube]].

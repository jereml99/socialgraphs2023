'''Victor James Santiago, Jr.''' (born September 6, 1977), better known by his [[stage name|stage names]] '''N.O.R.E.''' and '''Noreaga''', is an American rapper and broadcaster. Born and raised in Queens, New York,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/noreaga-mn0000457544|title=Noreaga - Biography, Albums, Streaming Links - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hip-hopvibe.com/2018/03/07/n-o-r-e-talks-on-the-run-eatin-food-show-on-swayinthemorning-video/|title=N.O.R.E. talks "On The Run Eatin'" food show on #SwayInTheMorning [VIDEO]|website=hip-hopvibe.com|date=7 March 2018|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref> Santiago first rose to prominence as one half of the [[East Coast hip hop]] duo [[Capone-N-Noreaga]] (C-N-N), alongside fellow Queens-based rapper [[Capone (rapper)|Capone]]. He would also have success as a solo artist with the singles "[[Superthug]]", "[[Banned from T.V.]]" (featuring [[Big Pun]], [[Nature (rapper)|Nature]], [[Cam'ron]], [[Jadakiss]], and [[Styles P]]), "[[Nothin' (song)|Nothin']]" (featuring [[Pharrell Williams|Pharrell]]) and "[[Oye Mi Canto]]".

Santiago has released music under various record labels, including [[Penalty Recordings|Penalty]], [[Roc-La-Familia]], [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]], and [[Babygrande Records]].

==Musical career==

===1995–1997: Career beginnings with Capone===
{{main|Capone-N-Noreaga}}

Santiago's career began to take off in 1995, while under the [[pseudonym]] Noreaga (after [[Panamanian]] ruler [[Manuel Noriega]])<ref>{{Cite web |last=Breihan |first=Tom |date=2017-05-30 |title=Noreaga Pays Tribute To Noriega |url=https://www.stereogum.com/1943623/noreaga-pays-tribute-to-noriega/news/ |access-date=2023-04-29 |website=Stereogum |language=en}}</ref> as part of the duo [[Capone-N-Noreaga]] alongside friend and fellow [[Queens]]-based rapper [[Capone (rapper)|Capone]], whom he met while serving time in prison. Santiago grew up in [[LeFrak City]] and spent time hanging out in Capone’s neighbouring [[Queensbridge Houses]].<ref name="Sanfiorenzo 2017">{{cite web | last=Sanfiorenzo | first=Dimas | title=N.O.R.E.

''The War Report'' was a commercial and critical success that made the duo well known among hip hop audiences. The album received praise for using the "traditional grimey boom-bap" sound of classic [[New York Hip-Hop|New York City hip hop]], which at that time was falling out in favor of a more futuristic sound. The album peaked at #21 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and the singles "Illegal Life", "Closer", and "T.O.N.Y. (Top of New York)" all charted on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles and Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanley |first=Leo |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0bfexqyhldse~T31 |title=The War Report - Capone-N-Noreaga |publisher=AllMusic |date=1997-06-17 |access-date=2012-04-17}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

===1997–2000: Solo career and debut album===
Following the release of the album, Capone was again sentenced to a jail term, which left Noreaga to take on a solo career and make an album on his own. Noreaga solo debut studio album ''[[N.O.R.E. (album)|N.O.R.E]]'', was released in 1998. The title, a shortening of the artist's name, used the [[backronym]] "[[Fugitive|Niggaz on (the) Run]] [[Money|Eatin']]". The album became even more successful than the duo's debut, charting at #3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and being [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The album features [[guest appearance]]s from fellow NYC rappers [[Nas]], [[Kool G Rap]], [[Big Pun]] and [[Busta Rhymes]]. It also features in many cases a different production style than ''The War Report'', including the modern futuristic sound, with tracks produced by then-up-and-coming producers [[The Neptunes]] and [[Swizz Beatz]]. The Neptunes produced the hit "[[Superthug]]", which reached #36 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #1 on the [[Hot Rap Tracks]] chart. The song, along with [[Mase]]'s hit "Lookin' At Me", was one of the Neptunes' first major productions.

In 1999, Noreaga would go on to release his second solo album, ''[[Melvin Flynt - Da Hustler]]'', which was a moderate success, reaching the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' 200 and becoming [[RIAA certification|certified gold]] by the RIAA. The album's most successful single (produced by The Neptunes) was "[[Oh No (Noreaga song)|Oh No"]], which reached #49 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles and Tracks]] chart. Capone was released from prison in 1999. The two subsequently began recording music together again and released their second C-N-N album in the year 2000. The album, titled ''[[The Reunion (Capone-N-Noreaga album)|The Reunion]]'', was not well-received critically and failed to match the commercial success of the duo's debut or Noreaga's solo albums. [[AllMusic]] reviewer Matt Conaway summed up the album by stating "With ''The Reunion'', Capone-N-Noreaga take a step backward." The group would then go on a hiatus and not release another album until 2009.

===2001–2007: Name change and reggaeton era===
Noreaga continued to pursue his career as a solo artist. He officially changed his stage name to N.O.R.E. in the late 1990s [<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Coleman II |first=C. Vernon |last2=High |first2=Kemet |date=2023-03-08 |title=Rappers Who Unsuccessfully Tried Changing Their Names |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/rappers-tried-changing-names/ |access-date=2023-08-05 |website=XXL Mag |language=en}}</ref>], and after some delays, his third solo studio album ''[[God's Favorite (album)|God's Favorite]]'', was released in 2002. The album peaked at #3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and was later certified platinum. It contained the major hit "[[Nothin' (song)|Nothin']]" (produced by The Neptunes), which reached #10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It became N.O.R.E.'s highest-charting hit.

Following ''God's Favorite'', N.O.R.E. changed his musical focus. He began recording [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] songs to reflect his [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] background and made [[reggaeton]] music, rather than traditional [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. The reggaeton single "[[Oye Mi Canto]]", was released in 2004 and became a major hit, peaking at #12 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The song was originally supposed to be a single from an upcoming album titled ''1 Fan a Day'', but the album was never released. Instead, N.O.R.E. released a reggaeton/hip hop album in 2006, titled ''[[N.O.R.E. y la Familia...Ya Tú Sabe]]'', which included the lead singles "Oye Mi Canto" and "[[Mas Maiz]]". The album, released under [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc-La-Familia]], has both English and Spanish language tracks. It did not chart nearly as well as any of N.O.R.E.'s previous solo albums, as it only reached #82 on the ''Billboard'' 200. He also is a playable character in [[Def Jam Vendetta]] and [[Def Jam Fight for New York]].

N.O.R.E. went on to release two more solo albums. The first, his fifth album ''[[Noreality]]'', was released in 2007 and supported by the single "Set It Off", featuring vocals and production from Swizz Beatz. N.O.R.E. released his CD/DVD, ''Noreality'', in September via a joint venture with his own Thugged Out Militainment label and [[Babygrande Records]]. The album features guest appearances from [[Jadakiss]], [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Kanye West]], [[Pharrell]], [[Mobb Deep]]'s Prodigy, [[Bun B]], [[Tru Life]], [[David Banner]], [[Kurupt]] and Capone. Swizz Beatz is among the producers. The DVD, which was available in limited quantities, is based on the rapper's life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051272/billboard-bits-grand-national-nore-molotov-more |title=Bits: Grand National, N.O.R.E., Molotov & More |date=27 June 2007 |publisher=Billboard |access-date=2013-10-06}}</ref>

The second album ''S.O.R.E.'', was controversially released in 2009. N.O.R.E. would go on to denounce ''S.O.R.E.'', calling it an album he had nothing to do with<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nahright.com/news/2009/09/24/video-nore-dont-support-sore/ |title=Video: N.O.R.E.: Don't Support S.O.R.E. |publisher=Nah Right |date=2009-09-24 |access-date=2013-10-06}}</ref> and asked fans not to purchase it.<ref>{{cite web |last=Langhorne |first=Cyrus |url=http://www.sohh.com/2009/09/nore_pleads_w_fans_to_not.html |title=N.O.R.E.

(album)|first album]] which is a [[backronym]] for "Niggaz on (the) Run Eatin'", which makes "S.O.R.E.", "Still on (the) Run Eatin'". The term was first used in late 2007, when N.O.R.E. released a song entitled "Still on the Run Eatin'", featuring [[Lil Wayne]]. N.O.R.E. said in a video blog that he didn't approve of this album. He also stated the album's [[cover art|artwork]] was of him at 310 pounds, adding he had lost 62 pounds since then. He also went on to mention five songs on the album were actually handed in, while the rest were pulled off the internet, some of which came from 2007, probably stemming from label financial issues. He later stated he was working on an album known as ''N.O.R.E. Pt. 2: Born Again'', later retitled ''[[Student of the Game]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brokencool.com/broken_cool/2009/09/video-nore-says-dont-support-sore.html |title=VIDEO: N.O.R.E.

===2009–present: ''Student of the Game'' ===
In 2009, N.O.R.E. collaborated with Capone once again, to release their third studio album ''[[Channel 10 (album)|Channel 10]]'', which charted at #136 on the ''Billboard'' 200. In 2010, a fourth Capone-N-Noreaga album titled ''[[The War Report 2]]'', was released. Its lead single was "Hood Pride", featuring [[Faith Evans]]. In June 2011, fellow American rapper [[Busta Rhymes]], with whom N.O.R.E. has collaborated several times in the past, stated on his Twitter account that he had officially signed N.O.R.E. to his newly founded record label [[Conglomerate Records]].<ref name="twitter1">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BusaBusss/status/84459854676242433 |title=Twitter |publisher=Twitter |access-date=2013-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Langhorne |first=Cyrus |url=http://www.sohh.com/2011/06/busta_rhymes_clears_up_nore_situation_i.html |title=Busta Rhymes Clears Up N.O.R.E.

Between 2009 and 2011, N.O.R.E. teamed up with [[DJ EFN]] to host a satellite radio show for Sirius XM called Militainment Crazy Raw Radio, a title that gave equal weight to N.O.R.E.'s Militainment brand, to EFN's Crazy Hood, and to 66 Raw, the channel on Sirius XM which carried the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://57thave.com/?p%3D377 |title=Militainment Crazy Raw Radio on Hip-Hop Nation &#124; 57thAve |access-date=September 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192458/http://57thave.com/?p=377 |archive-date=January 2, 2014 }}</ref>

In early 2013, Santiago stated that he would yet again change his [[moniker]], this time to P.A.P.I.

==Music career==

===1992–1995: early years===
Under stage name Fat Joe da Gangsta and part of the rap group [[D.I.T.C.]], Cartagena was signed to Relativity Records in the early 1990s, recording material and working with many artists whom he would later sign to his own label. In 1993, his debut album ''[[Represent (Fat Joe album)|Represent]]'' was released, featuring production from [[The Beatnuts]], [[Diamond D]], [[Lord Finesse]], and others. Its lead single, "[[Flow Joe]]" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Singles chart; other minor singles from the album included "Watch the Sound" and "This Shit Is Real".<ref name="all music"/>

In 1995, Fat Joe released his second studio album, ''[[Jealous One's Envy]]'', which peaked at #71 on The Billboard 200 and at #7 on Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums. The album featured a guest appearance from [[KRS-One]] and production from Diamond D. The lead single was "Success", which did not chart, but his second single, "Envy" peaked at #8 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. One day while writing for the album at [[Chung King Studios]], Fat Joe happened to find that his rap idol, [[LL Cool J]] was in another room with [[Trackmasters]], working on the remix version of LL's single "[[I Shot Ya]]". After being welcomed to contribute a verse, Joe appeared on the record and in its accompanying video along with [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], and [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] of [[Mobb Deep]]. The track is considered by Joe to be one of his career highlights.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2011/12/interview-fat-joe-25-best-songs/ll-cool-j-f-fat-joe-keith-murray-prodigy-foxy-brown-i-shot-ya-remix-1996|website=www.complex.com|title=Fat Joe Breaks Down His 25 Most Essential Songs|author=Daniel Isenberg|date=December 7, 2011|quote=That sh-- was the craziest collabo.

So he got on the record.}}</ref> 

During the recording of ''Jealous One's Envy'', Joe discovered fellow [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] rapper [[Big Pun]], who was featured on the song "Watch Out". Joe later explained the rapper's influence on him: "Latinos before us who had the opportunity to do it just didn't know how to do it. They came in trying to do this black music, waving flags. [But] we're trying to kick in the doors for other Latinos and represent our people, and it shows."<ref name="ChicagoTribune">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-05-28/news/0305290041_1_fat-joe-joe-cartagena-latino-rapper|title=The skinny on Fat Joe|work=The Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tony W.

Fat Joe released his fourth album ''[[Jealous Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.)]]'' in 2001, with Fat Joe eexecutive producing the album.

Kelly]], [[Buju Banton]], and artists from his Terror Squad label. The lead single "[[We Thuggin']]" featuring R. Kelly was a big hit in late 2001, but would not reach the level of his hit single "[[What's Luv?]]". At the time of the album's release, Fat Joe was managed by The Squad Music. The album was Fat Joe's biggest album commercially, being certified Platinum in America for shipping and selling over a million copies.<ref name="riaa cert"/> However, Fat Joe's fifth album ''[[Loyalty (Fat Joe album)|Loyalty]]'', released later in 2002, was not as successful.

In 2003, Fat Joe was featured in the pop single "[[I Want You/Me Pones Sexy|I Want You]]" by Mexican singer [[Thalía]]. The same year, he and Tony Sunshine performed the single "Crush Tonight" from ''Loyalty'' on the Comedy Central program ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''.

Despite the setback, Fat Joe scored a number-one hit in 2004 with his group Terror Squad, collaborating with Remy Ma on the Scott Storch production "[[Lean Back]]" from the album ''[[True Story (Terror Squad album)|True Story]]''.<ref name="amg terror squad"/> Jason Birchmeier of [[AllMusic]] called the song "a perfect club-ready duet between Joe and Remy Ma that boasts a trademark [[Scott Storch]] beat and a memorable singalong hook and dance-along step".<ref>{{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title="True Story" – Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r703323|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2004|access-date=November 10, 2007}}</ref> He then began recording material for [[Ivy Queen]]'s debut English-language album ''[[Real (Ivy Queen album)|Real]]'' in support of her goal to compete in the world of English-language hip hop music.<ref name="Caracol">{{cite web|url=http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/ivy-queen-se-lanza-a-conquistar-el-mercado----ingles/20031111/nota/154264.aspx |title=Ivy Queen se lanza a conquistar el mercado inglés |language=es |work=Caracol Radio |publisher=Caracol S.A |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=December 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152851/http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/ivy-queen-se-lanza-a-conquistar-el-mercado----ingles/20031111/nota/154264.aspx |archive-date=November 5, 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/fats-chance/15383/|title=Fat's Chance|work=[[The New York Sun]]|publisher=The New York Sun|author=Edlund, Martin|date=June 14, 2005|access-date=February 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n11/Reggaeton.html |title=It's Reggae, It's Rap, And It's Muy Caliente; This Puerto Rican Sound Is Called Reggaeton, And It's Catching Fire In The U.S. |work=San Antonio Mercury News |publisher=San Antonio Mercury News |author=Pacio, Nerissa |date=April 8, 2005 |access-date=April 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210315/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n11/Reggaeton.html |archive-date=March 3, 2016  }}</ref> Fat Joe portrayed himself and provided his own voice and likeness for the September 2004 video game, ''[[Def Jam: Fight For NY]]''.

===LGBT beliefs and support===
During an interview with [[DJ Vlad|Vlad TV]], Joe stated that he believes that gay people should not hide their sexuality and should stand by who they are. He mentioned that it's possible that he has done songs with gay rappers and that there are likely several gay people besides rappers in the hip hop industry who are in the closet, describing it as a "Gay Mafia".<ref>{{cite web|author=illseed |url=http://allhiphop.com/2011/11/13/hip-hop-rumors-the-gay-mafia-runs-hip-hop-fat-joe-says/ |title=Hip-Hop Rumors: The Gay Mafia Runs Hip-Hop, Fat Joe Says! |publisher=AllHipHop.com |date=November 13, 2011 |access-date=May 12, 2012}}</ref>

His comments came after he was asked to comment on radio personality [[Mister Cee]] being arrested for public lewdness with a transgender sex worker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/11/11/fat-joe-says-gay-rappers-should-represent-themselves/ |title=Fat Joe Wants Gay Rappers To 'Rep' Their Sexuality |publisher=Rapfix.mtv.com |date=November 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113172509/http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/11/11/fat-joe-says-gay-rappers-should-represent-themselves/|archive-date=November 13, 2011|access-date=June 6, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>

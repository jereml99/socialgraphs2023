'''Kiam Akasi Holley''' (born February 8, 1976), better known by his stage name '''Capone''', is an American [[Rapping|rapper]] known as one half of the [[East Coast hip hop]] duo [[Capone-N-Noreaga]] (C-N-N), alongside friend and fellow rapper [[N.O.R.E.]].

==Career==
Holley spent some time in jail after the release of C-N-N's debut album ''[[The War Report]].'' When he was released, he and [[N.O.R.E.]] recorded their second album ''[[The Reunion (Capone-N-Noreaga album)|The Reunion]]'', but shortly after releasing the album, Capone was sent back to jail.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/capone-mn0001363638/biography|title=Capone {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 21, 2018}}</ref> In 2004, he recorded the single "I Need Speed", for exclusive use in the video game ''[[Need for Speed: Underground 2]]'', which was featured on the game's soundtrack. In early 2005, [[Def Jam Recordings]] released Capone from his contract while retaining Noreaga, leaving the group's status in disarray. Capone released his debut album titled ''Pain, Time & Glory'' in 2005, but it received poor sales. He also appeared on the [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]] album ''My World''.

In 2020 Capone released collaborative album entitled "Guidelines" with one half of the Dogg Pound [[Daz Dillinger]] under [[Empire Distribution]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=jbanks|date=2020-08-18|title=Daz Dillinger & Capone Detail Docuseries With Kurupt + Say Ja Rule & 50 Cent Need Next Verzuz Battle|url=https://www.935kday.com/2020/08/18/daz-dillinger-capone-detail-docuseries-with-kurupt-say-ja-rule-50-cent-need-next-verzuz-battle/|access-date=2021-06-22|website=KDAY-FM|language=en-US}}</ref>

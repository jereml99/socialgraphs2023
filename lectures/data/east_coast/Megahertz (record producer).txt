'''Dorsey Wesley''', better known by his stage name '''Megahertz''', is an American record producer, composer and songwriter.

''[[Vibe Magazine]]'' dubbed Megahertz one of music's "10 Most Valuable Producers",<ref name="google">{{cite journal |title=Vibe |journal=Vibe Vixen |publisher=Vibe Media Group |issn=1070-4701 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SYEAAAAMBAJ |date=May 2003 |access-date=2014-11-15}}</ref> while [[About.com]] ranked him on its list of the "Top 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Producers".<ref name="about">{{cite web |url=http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top50Producers_10.htm |title=Top 50 Hip-Hop Producers |publisher=Rap.About.com |first=Henry |last=Adaso |access-date=2014-11-15}}</ref>

Described by ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' as a "Powerful Producer",<ref name="google2">{{cite book |title=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |issn=0006-2510 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XhAEAAAAMBAJ |page=57 |date=March 16, 2002 |access-date=2014-11-15}}</ref> Megahertz has enjoyed commercial success producing music for television, film, video games, mixtapes & songs that have been certified gold, platinum and multiplatinum.

== Early career ==
Megahertz is a native of [[Willingboro, New Jersey]].<ref name="Complex" /> He was raised in a "Christian household that didn't allow rap music."<ref name="google2" /> Trying to keep his passion hidden, he would get "extra church time" if his mom heard him rapping. Despite his rigid religious upbringing, Megahertz immersed himself in what his mother called "evil music".<ref name="mtv">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451235/nas-diddy-producer-megahertz-on-rise.jhtml |title=Nas, P. Diddy Producer Megahertz Is Hot New Beatmaker on the Block |publisher=MTV.com |date=November 28, 2001 |access-date=2014-11-15}}</ref>

But as Megahertz admitted to ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'', "Not being able to listen to music only made me want to hear it more."<ref name="google2" /> Tired of rapping over other people's beats, Megahertz began to purchase his own equipment and secretly keep it at his friend's house. Before long, producing music took precedence over rapping.<ref name="mtv" />

One of his first breakthrough hits was "[[Bad Boy for Life]]".<ref name="mtv" /> According to ''Vibe Magazine'', "...Megahertz's bionic rubber-band beat for 'Bad Boy for Life' put Diddy back in the winner's circle."<ref name="google" /> Grammy nominated<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031024131701/http://allcharts.org/news/2002/01/26/00000022.htm publisher=allcharts.org]</ref> and certified four times platinum, it was the second single from [[P. Diddy]]'s ''[[The Saga Continues...|The Saga Continues]]'', which peaked at number two on the US Billboard Mainstream Top 40.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/diddy-mn0000413000/awards |title=Awards: Diddy |publisher=AllMusic.com |access-date=2014-11-15}}</ref> The "[[Bad Boy for Life]]" music video featured cameo's by actor [[Ben Stiller]], rock drummer [[Travis Barker]], NBA star [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and others.<ref name="mvdbase">{{cite web |url=http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=21261 |title=P.

== Commercial success ==
Described by ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' as a "powerful producer",<ref name="google2" /> Megahertz has enjoyed commercial success producing music for television, film, video games, mixtapes & songs that have been certified gold, platinum and multiplatinum.

Associated with artists such as [[P. Diddy]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Jay-Z]], [[50 Cent]], [[R. Kelly]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Nas]] & ''Saturday Night Live's'' [[Robert Smigel]] – it has been said that Megahertz "..brings the wattage."<ref name="google" />

Megahertz made history when he produced "Gotta Make It to Heaven" for the fourth highest selling U.S. rap album of all-time, [[50 Cent]]'s ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]''. With over 12&nbsp;million copies sold, it is on one of the best selling albums of the decade.<ref name="allhiphop">{{cite web |url=http://allhiphop.com/2013/02/06/10-overlooked-facts-about-50-cents-get-rich-or-die-tryin |title=10 Overlooked Facts About 50 Cent's 'Get Rich Or Die Tryin' |publisher=AllHipHop.com |date=February 6, 2013 |access-date=2014-11-15}}</ref>

== Production style ==
Music writer [[Raqiyah Mays]] wrote, "There's power in Megahertz's name: a million cycles per second, to be exact. And when you buy his beats it's as if that power electrocutes whomever he's working with, shocking them into accelerating their skills."

Megahertz's genre-bending production style uses original composition, in combination with the occasional use of sampled sounds or songs, performed over programmed drums.

One such track was the [[Nas]] single "[[Got Ur Self a Gun]]", which used "Woke Up This Morning" – the theme song from HBO's ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Referencing the music Megahertz created around that sample, [[MTV]]'s Shaheed Reid wrote, "Megahertz molded pianos and strings that sound like they could've been played at the coronation ceremony for an 18th century king."<ref name="mtv2">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451188/nas-goes-on-dis-rampage-on-new-lp.jhtml |title=Nas Disses Jay-Z, Endless List of Others on New LP |publisher=MTV.com |date=November 26, 2001 |access-date=2014-11-15}}</ref>

Another example of his knack for reinterpreting popular music occurred when Megahertz created a track for [[Tony Yayo]]'s debut album using a sample made popular by [[Britney Spears]]. In the words of one fan, "'Love My Style' is probably one of the album's craziest tracks as Megahertz flips the same sample used on Britney Spears's '[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]].' What was once sugar-sweet pop takes on a menacing and minister tone and Yayo takes full advantage as he attacks the beat with confidence."<ref name="rapreviews">{{cite web |url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2005_09_thoughtsof.html |title=Tony Yayo :: Thoughts of a Predicate Felon :: G-Unit/Interscope Records |publisher=RapReviews.com |date=September 6, 2005 |access-date=2014-11-15}}</ref>

Megahertz's diverse production style, opened the door for collaborations with rock groups like [[P.O.D.]] & [[Linkin Park]]. Attracted to unusual musical pairings, Megahertz told ''[[Source Magazine]]'', "I like [[System of a Down]] and I wouldn't mind doing something with them....I'd work with [[Limp Bizkit]] and I'm a [[Björk]] fan. I'll do Calypso. I'll do some Indian music, whatever, just bring it on. I'll do it."

Resolute that his music continue to evolve, Megahertz said, "I'm not into repeat joints- I want to be re-discovered for new sounds each time."

==Performer==
As a performer Megahertz grew up rapping, a talent that blossomed into creating jingles, commercial spots and ultimately led to songwriting & singing. In one such performance, Megahertz drops a cameo on the chorus of "Superstar", a song that features [[Ice Cube]], [[WC (rapper)|WC]] & [[Mack 10]].<ref name="lyricsnmusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/westside-connection/superstar-double-murder-double-platinum-lyrics/6726137 |title=Westside Connection – Superstar (Double Murder=Double Platinum) Lyrics |publisher=LYRICSnMUSIC.com |access-date=2014-11-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131028002956/http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/westside-connection/superstar-double-murder-double-platinum-lyrics/6726137 |archive-date=October 28, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

== Controversy ==
One of the most high-profile feuds in American hip hop history was the rivalry between [[Jay-Z]] & [[Nas]]. ''Vibe Magazine'' writer Dave Tompkins recounts, "When Jigga's (a.k.a. [[Jay-Z]]'s) publicized beef with [[Nas]] reached nasty proportions, everyone waited on a response from God's Son (a.k.a. Nas). And he came out swinging with the Megahertz produced "[[Got Ur Self A Gun]]" – a killer cut laced with a violent harpsichord."<ref name="google" />

The track was the second single on [[Nas]]' ''[[Stillmatic]]'' album, and just days after its release, [[Jay-Z]] retaliated by putting out "[[Supa Ugly]]", a combative freestyle, performed over "[[Got Ur Self A Gun]]" and [[Dr. Dre]]'s song "Bad Intentions."<ref name="mtv3">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451446/jay-z-nas-feud-gets-super-ugly.jhtml |title=Feud Between Jay-Z, Nas Gets 'Super Ugly' – MTV |publisher=mtv.com |access-date=2014-11-15}}</ref>

==Later years==
At the height of his production career, he suddenly disappeared from the music industry. According to Megahertz, the reason was due to the death of his father around the time of his success.<ref name="Complex">{{cite web |last=Cantor |first=Paul |title=If Megahertz Was About to Become a Superproducer, Why Did He Disappear? |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/04/megahertz-rap-producer-disappered |publisher=Complex.com |date=April 2, 2014 |access-date=2014-03-04}}</ref>

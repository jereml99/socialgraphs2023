==Musical career==
===2010–14: Career beginnings and ''V.I.C.E.S.''===
Dash began [[rapping]] around the age of 16 and subsequently uploaded music on [[MySpace]]. Dash first gained major recognition in August 2012, when he appeared on three tracks from East Coast hip hop [[ASAP Mob]]'s debut [[mixtape]], ''[[Lords Never Worry|Lord$ Never Worry]]''. Also in 2012, Dash formed the hip hop duo The Heirs (or The H'z for short), which stands for '''H'''igh '''E'''veryday '''I'''gnoring '''R'''ules, with fellow New Jersey-based rapper RetcH. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 2013, Dash released his sixth solo mixtape ''V.I.C.E.S.'' (which stands for ''Very Ignorant Content Exposing Success''), to moderate success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/06/dash-vices-mixtape |title=Mixtape: Da$H "V.I.C.E.S."|author=Dharmic X|work=Complex|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/DaH-VICES-mixtape.504799.html |title=Da$H – V.I.C.E.S|work=DatPiff|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}</ref> The mixtape features [[guest appearance]]s from [[Action Bronson]], [[Vince Staples]], as well as [[ASAP Mob]] members [[ASAP Nast]] and [[ASAP Ferg]], among others. The production was handled by [[Mac Miller|Larry Fisherman]], [[Earl Sweatshirt|Randomblackdude]], [[Thelonious Martin]] and more. Dash followed up with the release of a two-track [[extended play]] (EP) titled, ''That Time We Smoked Dust'' (2014), in collaboration with RetcH.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xclusiveszone.net/2014/05/dash-retch-the-time-we-smoked-dust-ep/|title=Da$h & Retch – The Time We Smoked Dust EP|work=Xclusives Zone|accessdate=July 7, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510093821/http://www.xclusiveszone.net/2014/05/dash-retch-the-time-we-smoked-dust-ep/|archivedate=May 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
In 2014, in an interview with New York music magazine ''[[The Fader]]'', former [[Odd Future]] member [[Earl Sweatshirt]] said that Dash was staying at his apartment in Los Angeles, and that they were working on music together.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/05/14/at-home-with-earl-sweatshirt/}}</ref> Earl had previously produced the track "Whalé" from ''V.I.C.E.S'', as well as appearing with him on [[Mac Miller]]'s track, "New Faces".{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===2015–present: ''Skrewface'' and ''17 More Minutes''===
In 2015, Da$h released an EP titled ''Skrewface,'' followed by a mixtape titled ''17 More Minutes.'' Music videos were released on Da$h's YouTube page for the tracks "RicHie K II," "Hello," and "Seymour," along with a short video series, "DEADMANWALKIN," a documentary-style installation following his experiences on the "Live Now x Die Later" [[concert tour]]. In 2017, Da$h released his debut album ''Loose Skrew'', which was released under his independent label ''H'z Global''. He would later go on to release two more albums under H'z Global; ''5 Deadly Venoms'' in 2019 with rapper V Don, and ''Walk The Plank'' in 2020.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

==Early life==
Le'Quincy Anderson was born and raised in [[the Bronx]] in New York City. He began writing raps in the 5th grade but did not start taking rap seriously until high school, he first rapped in a booth at the age of 16. Don grew up listening to artists such as [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]], [[Fabolous]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Styles P]], [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Jay-Z]].<ref>[http://highbridgethelabel.com/artists/don-q/] {{dead link|date=May 2023}}</ref>

As he got older he began battle rapping in the streets, parks, and different blocks which helped him build confidence. Don began battling because he was inspired by the Smack DVD series. Don's first stage name was Q da Don, he would then change it to [[Don Q]], after the popular rum after seeing it on the shelves at local liquor stores. Don released his first mixtape at 17. The mixtape was in dedication to Andre "Pop" Davidson, a standout basketball player at [[John F. Kennedy High School (New York City)|John F. Kennedy High School]] who died. Pop was Don's best friend and the first person to co-sign Don's rapping talent.<ref>{{cite AV media| url-status = live| archive-url = https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/5_S0z5iOu30| archive-date = 2021-12-11| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_S0z5iOu30| title = Don Q on Starting Out as a Battle Rapper, Never Wanted to be the Best Battler (Part 1) | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The mixtape, however, did not receive much traction outside of Highbridge. Don almost quit rapping losing motivation as he did not have money to pay for studio sessions. Don was still worried about continuing his school studies and the streets but he came to the conclusion that rap was going to be his way to a better life. He made appearances in the local battle circuit where he rapped for several leagues such as Battle On The Beat, Blue Collar Television and Come Up Groundz.<ref name="auto">[http://press.atlanticrecords.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Don-Q-Bio-417.docx] {{dead link|date=May 2023}}</ref>

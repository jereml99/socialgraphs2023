==Early life==
Rahlique Devawn Wilks was born on December 4, 1997, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], in the same area as fellow WOO member [[Pop Smoke]]. He grew up listening to [[50 Cent]], [[Jay-Z]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Lil Wayne]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Break Presents: Rah Swish |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/rah-swish-interview-the-break/ |website=xxlmag |access-date=31 July 2022}}</ref> He said in an interview with AllHipHop "It was cool growing up. You don’t really know nothing else so you accept what you’re in. It was calm, it was regular. Street life, young black man growing up in the hood. Regular shit." when asked about growing up in [[Canarsie, Brooklyn]]. Swish started rapping in 2015 on a song called 50 Bars Pt. 1 and began to gain buzz around Brooklyn. "From 2015 on, alright I’m a rapper now." Swish met Pop Smoke in the street when they were doing "street shit", he said in the same AllHipHop interview " We met on the block. I was rapping before him. Once he started rapping, we kept clicking together more and more. It was a vibe. You see Pop, you see Rah."<ref>{{cite web |title=Rah Swish Is Here To Keep Pop Smoke’s Legacy Afloat |url=https://fomoblog.com/2020/09/01/rah-swish-is-here-to-keep-pop-smokes-legacy-afloat/ |website=fomoblog |access-date=31 July 2022}}</ref>

Accessed on May 6, 2019.</ref> better known by the stage name of '''Large Professor''' (also '''Extra P.''' and '''Large Pro'''), is an American rapper and music producer. Based in New York City, he is known as a founding member of the [[underground hip hop]] group [[Main Source]] and as mentor and frequent collaborator of [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.matadorrecords.com/large_professor/biography.html | publisher= Matador Records | title= Large Professor | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130723141654/http://www.matadorrecords.com/large_professor/biography.html | archive-date= July 23, 2013 }}</ref> [[About.com]] ranked Large Professor at No. 13 on its Top 25 Hip-Hop Producers list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top50Producers_8.htm |title=Top 50 Hip-Hop Producers |author=Henry Adaso |author2=Ivan Rott |author3=Renato P. |author4=Bhaskar S. |author5=Henry A. |website =[[About.com]]}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
William Paul Mitchell was born in [[Harlem]], New York City, and raised in [[Flushing, Queens]], New York City, where he attended [[John Bowne High School]].<ref name=ALLMUSIC>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p96585/biography|pure_url=yes}} Large Professor Biography] at Allmusic.com</ref><ref name="Vinyl">{{cite web|url=https://magazine.vinylmeplease.com/magazine/breaking-atoms-legendary-album-invented-sound-classic-new-york-hip-hop/|title=Breaking Atoms: The Legendary Album That Invented The Sound Of "Classic" New York Hip-Hop|publisher=VinylMePlease.com|access-date=May 6, 2020}}</ref>

== Career ==

Large Professor started making his earliest beats with two turntables, a [[Casio SK-1]] sampler, and pause-tape cassettes before his mentor [[Paul C]] taught him how to use an [[E-mu SP-1200]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web| url= http://www.complex.com/music/2012/05/large-professor-tells-all-the-stories-behind-his-classic-records-part-i/eric-b-rakim-in-the-ghetto-1990|title=Large Professor Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records (Part 1) Eric B. & Rakim "In The Ghetto" (1990)| website=Complex.com |access-date=September 1, 2017}}</ref> During his pause tape phase he noted that some of his techniques were different than those of other producers. "I was trying to catch it from a different part of the record. I would catch it from the hi-hat when dudes were just catching it from the one kick. I would catch it from the third hi-hat and be flipping it."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kayser|first=Brian|title=Words 2|publisher=seven3zero publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-1-5452-1951-5|pages=96}}</ref>

In 1989 he joined the group [[Main Source]], which also included [[Toronto]] natives [[K-Cut]] and Sir Scratch. In 1990 Large produced three tracks for [[Eric B. & Rakim]]'s ''[[Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em]]'', including "In the Ghetto".<ref name=":2" /> To make "In the Ghetto", he sampled directly off of a cassette tape of sample ideas Paul C had made for Rakim.<ref name=":2" />

Main Source recorded one album with Large called ''[[Breaking Atoms]]'', which was released in 1991. It included hits such as "Just Hangin' Out", "[[Looking at the Front Door]]", and featured [[Nas]]' first public appearance on a track called "Live at the Barbeque", along with [[Akinyele (rapper)|Akinyele]] and Joe Fatal.<ref name=ALLMUSIC /> Large Professor now considers "Looking at the Front Door" one of the most emotional records of his career, later saying "That's a deep record. At that time in life, I was eighteen years old. It was a kid with a pure heart, just writing, and putting his soul out there for the world."<ref name="Vinyl" />

In 1992, their success allowed them to record "[[Fakin' the Funk]]", a track on the ''[[White Men Can't Jump]]'' motion-picture soundtrack. Because of business differences, Large and Main Source quietly parted ways and Large went on to sign with [[Geffen Records]].

During and after his tenure with Main Source, he worked with [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]], and he produced a number of tracks for Nas, [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Masta Ace]], [[The X-Ecutioners]], [[Tragedy Khadafi]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Mobb Deep]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and others during the 1990s.<ref name="LargeProCredits">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/large-professor-mn0000121234/credits|title=Large Professor – Credits|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 6, 2020}}</ref> During this time he handled a significant amount of production on several projects for other artists. In 1993 he produced Akinyele's entire ''[[Vagina Diner]]'' album, which experienced some modest commercial success at the time of its release.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BEEAAAAMBAJ&q=akinyele+%22vagina+diner%22&pg=PA20|magazine= Billboard|title= Dining out| date= September 4, 1993| publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> Though the album did well at first, ''[[The Source]]'' later wrote an article criticizing the song "I Luh Huh", in which Akinyele considers pushing his pregnant girlfriend down the stairs as a form of abortion.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web| url= https://ifihavent.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/dear-ak-editorial-in-the-source-answer-letter-1993-94/|title=Dear Ak, Editorial in The Source + Answer letter (1993–94)| first=Thabiso |last= Mofokeng|date=March 30, 2009|website=Press Rewind If I Haven't...|access-date=September 1, 2017}}</ref> The ensuing backlash for the controversial lyrics hurt the album's performance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/05/large-professor-tells-all-the-stories-behind-his-classic-records-part-i/akinyele-the-bomb-1993|title=Large Professor Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records (Part 1) Akinyele "The Bomb" (1993)|website=Complex.com |access-date=September 1, 2017}}</ref> Akinyele wrote a response in the next issue defending the song and pointing out that the violent ideas in the songs are just thoughts, and he ends the song by saying "Just cause I talk this shit don't get me wrong, Yo, I still luh hur."<ref name=":4" />

Large Professor also produced "Keep It Rollin'" on A Tribe Called Quest's ''[[Midnight Marauders]]'' not long after he left Main Source. This was a major moment in his career that helped him reach a new level of credibility and exposure as a solo artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/05/large-professor-tells-all-the-stories-behind-his-classic-records-part-i/a-tribe-called-quest-f-large-professor-keep-it-rollin-1993|title=Large Professor Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records (Part 1) A Tribe Called Quest f/ Large Professor "Keep It Rollin'" (1993)|website=Complex.com |access-date=September 1, 2017}}</ref>

In 1994, Large Professor produced three of the ten songs on Nas's ''[[Illmatic]]'' ("[[Halftime (song)|Halftime]]", "[[One Time 4 Your Mind]]", and "[[It Ain't Hard to Tell]]"), the most of any producer involved with the album. According to an interview with Busta Rhymes, the "Halftime" beat was originally intended for him.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book| url= https://archive.org/details/bestmusicwriting00carr| url-access= registration| page= [https://archive.org/details/bestmusicwriting00carr/page/163 163]| quote= large professor.|title=Best Music Writing 2010|last1=Powers|first1=Ann|last2=Carr|first2=Daphne|date=November 9, 2010|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81925-4|language=en}}</ref> Though he liked the beat, he didn't end up using it and later regretted it after hearing "Halftime".<ref name=":0" /> While describing the making of the song in an interview Large Pro said, "I mean, we just wanted to put something gritty out there to the world, and those drums—that's what it was at that time. It was that gritty, muffled out, because the Hip Hop that we grew up with… We grew up with park jam tapes and things like the fidelity of these tapes."<ref name=":3">{{Cite news| url= http://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.2359/title.large-professor-confirms-refusing-illmatic-executive-producer-credit| title=Large Professor Confirms Refusing 'Illmatic' Executive Producer Credit| last= Grant| first= Andre |work= HipHopDX.com |access-date= February 15, 2018}}</ref> He was so instrumental in the making of ''Illmatic'' that Nas wanted to give him an executive producer credit, but he refused.<ref name=":3" />

In 1996, Large Professor completed his debut solo album ''[[The LP]]'' for Geffen Records. It was promoted by the singles "[[The Mad Scientist (song)|The Mad Scientist]]" and "[[I Juswannachill]]". After several delays, the album was shelved<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDCCXY8FLXwC&q=large+professor+%22the+lp%22&pg=PA174|title=5 Grams: Crack Cocaine, Rap Music, and the War on Drugs|last=Bogazianos|first=Dimitri A.| date= December 1, 2011|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-2306-7|language=en}}</ref> and later released as a bootleg version in 2002. An official release of the album finally came out in 2009, thirteen years after its original intended release date.<ref name=":1" />

In 2001, Large Pro produced "You're da Man" and "Rewind" for Nas's ''[[Stillmatic]]'' album. He first played Nas the beat for "You're da Man" while Nas was working on ''[[Nastradamus]]'' a few years prior.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/06/large-professor-tells-all-the-stories-behind-his-classic-records-part-2/nas-youre-da-man|title=Large Professor Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records (Part 2) Nas "You're Da Man" (2001)|website=Complex.com |access-date=September 1, 2017}}</ref> Nas chose the beat but decided to save it for a later project.<ref name=":5" /> Large Professor also used the same vocal sample from the chorus on the song "The Man"  for his ''[[1st Class (album)|1st Class]]'' album.

On December 22, 2002, at a concert in Toronto, the original members of Main Source performed together for the first time in nearly 10 years.<ref name="now">{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/music/raps-main-source |title=Rap's Main Source |website=[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]] |date=December 19, 2002 |accessdate=November 16, 2021}}</ref>

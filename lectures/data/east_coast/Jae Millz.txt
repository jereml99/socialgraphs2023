Millz grew to local fame by winning hip hop battles and doing performances and releasing a number of [[mixtape]]s. In 2003, he released his debut single "No, No, No", which received radio play and peaked at number 89 on the US ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Jae Millz Album & Song Chart History: R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=jae millz|chart=all}}|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|access-date=2012-12-29}}</ref> After the success of the song, Millz was offered a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. However, due to creative differences, he left the label, without having an album released. Soon after that he signed with [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal Records]].

==== Ohio Valley Wrestling (2000–2002) ====
On October 10, 2000, while billed as ''The Prototype'', Cena made his unofficial debut for then [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) on a ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' taping in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] against Mikey Richardson, which he lost.<ref>{{cite web |title=2000 |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/00.htm |access-date=August 3, 2014 |publisher=The History of WWE}}</ref> He received another tryout on January 9, 2001 at a ''SmackDown!'' taping in Oakland, California, defeating Aaron Aguilera before wrestling again in a dark match at a ''SmackDown!'' taping on March 13.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=John Cena's Profile |url=https://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profile/john-cena/ |access-date=October 25, 2022 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>

In 2001, Cena signed a developmental contract with the WWF and was assigned to its [[developmental territory]] [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW).<ref name="slam" /><ref name=":5" /> During his time there, Cena wrestled under the [[ring name]] ''The Prototype'' and held the [[OVW Heavyweight Championship]] for three months and the [[OVW Southern Tag Team Championship]] (with [[Rico Constantino]])<ref name="realitynews" /><ref name=":1" /> for two months.<ref name="OVWTitle">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ky/ovw/ovw-h.html|title=OVW Heavyweight Title|access-date=April 12, 2007|work=Wrestling-Titles}}</ref><ref name="OVWTT"/> 

Throughout the early months of 2002, Cena constantly found himself competing on house shows for the WWF, where he wrestled against the likes of [[Shelton Benjamin]] and [[Tommy Dreamer]]. After his main call up in June 2002, he continued to appear on OVW programming until September 25, when he lost to Kenny Brolin in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|Loser Leaves OVW match]]. He would later appear in a one-off appearance for the developmental farm in November under the ring name ''Mr. P'' in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Relevos Australianos|six-man tag team match]], where he teamed with [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]] and [[Charlie Haas]], in a winning effort against [[Lance Cade]], [[Trevor Murdoch]] and [[Sean O'Haire]].<ref name=":5" /> 

Cena's call-up to the main roster meant that he was part of OVW's now legendary Class of 2002, alongside [[Brock Lesnar]], [[Randy Orton]] and [[Dave Bautista|Batista]], a class which would eventually become known as the "OVW 4".<ref name=":1" />

[[File:Cena FU Animated.gif|thumb|upright=1.18|Cena performing his finishing move, a [[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|fireman's carry slam]] known as the ''Attitude Adjustment'', on [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]]]
Cena's original gimmick portrayed a white rapper who wore jerseys, backwards hats, a chain with a padlock around his neck, and was known as the "Doctor of Thuganomics".<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":4" /> First as ''"The Prototype"'', and later under his real name, Cena sometimes used underhanded tactics to score victories, such as using his chain as a weapon behind the referee's back. Cena often rapped before his matches, insulting his opponents, events that happened in the media and even the crowd.<ref name="slam" /> Cena also regularly performed "[[rap battles]]", where he and his opponent took turns rapping on each other.<ref name=":2" /> In 2006, shortly after his debut film, ''The Marine'', his wrestling character shifted from that of a rapper to a young military upstart, wearing dog tags and cargo shorts to the ring and also performing a salute to the crowd. Cena said in a 2011 interview with WWE.com that "every night when I do that salute, it's also a sign of respect to the men and women that don the uniform of the Armed Forces."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/tributetothetroops/story-behind-cena-salute|title=The story behind John Cena's salute|work=WWE|first=Bobby|last=Melok|date=December 16, 2011|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref>

During [[PG Era|WWE's change from TV-14 to TV-PG]] in mid-2008, the name of Cena's finishing move, the ''[[Fireman's carry takeover|FU]]'', was changed to the ''Attitude Adjustment'' and his finishing submission move, the ''STFU'', was renamed the ''STF'' to fit with the WWE's new policies.<ref name=":8">{{cite web |last=Powell |first=Jason |date=February 5, 2009 |title=John Cena says it was his call to change his finishing move name, predicts that three wrestlers will be WWE stars |url=https://prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article1004487.shtml |access-date=July 23, 2018 |website=Pro Wrestling Dot Net}}</ref> During his career, he has been known for ending his matches with a sequence of moves, dubbed the "[[five moves of doom|Five Moves of Doom]]". The moves typically go in the following order: flying shoulder block, sit-out hip toss, protobomb, ''Five Knuckle Shuffle'', and ''Attitude Adjustment''.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=August 15, 2013 |title=Inside John Cena's 'Five Moves of Doom' |url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-08-12/john-cena-five-moves-of-doom |access-date=October 25, 2022 |website=WWE}}</ref> 

Cena has portrayed a heroic character throughout his WWE career, except for a villainous run in 2002–2003.<ref name=":9" /> His signature ring gear includes jean shorts, sneakers, wristbands, and armbands.<ref name="yru" /> He also wears a variety of T-shirts and baseball caps, which commonly include one of his catchphrases: "Never Give Up", "You Can't See Me", "Hustle, Loyalty, Respect", and "Respect.

During his WWE career, Cena's has used his attire in an attempt to reflect the most current fashions and styling within the [[hip hop culture]] that his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|character]] represents. Cena started out wearing "[[throwback uniforms|throwback jerseys]]" and [[Reebok pumps]] until WWE produced specific Cena merchandise which he began wearing.<ref name=":9" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/classics/john-cenas-career-in-t-shirts|title=The history of John Cena's T-shirts|work=WWE}}</ref> While Cena was a member of the ''SmackDown'' brand, one of his WWE-produced T-shirts bore the suggestive [[spoonerism]] "Ruck Fules".

Around the time ''The Marine'' was released, Cena began wearing more military related attire, including [[Military camouflage|camouflage]] shorts, [[Dog tag (identifier)|dog tags]], a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] soldier cap, and a WWE produced shirt with the legend "Chain Gang Assault Battalion".<ref>{{Cite web |title=John Cena Studio Fathead |url=http://shopzone.wwe.com:80/product_detail.asp?productId=10-00492 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113060457/http://shopzone.wwe.com:80/product_detail.asp?productId=10-00492 |archive-date=November 13, 2007 |access-date=October 25, 2022 |publisher=Shopzone.WWE.com}}</ref> Shortly after WrestleMania 23, when promotion for ''The Marine'' ended, the military attire diminished and was replaced with apparel bearing his new slogan "American Made Muscle" along with denim shorts, not seen since he was a member of the ''SmackDown'' roster.<ref>{{Cite web |title=John Cena Youth American Made Muscle Package |url=http://shopzone.wwe.com/product_detail.asp?productId=50-02544&cartID=2007100721501321831024118 |access-date=October 26, 2022 |publisher=Shopzone.WWE.com}}</ref> He then wore shirts that promoted Cenation and his trademark line "You Can't See Me".<ref name=":11" />

In December 2017, the [[Ford Motor Company]] filed a lawsuit against Cena for selling his 2017 [[Ford GT#Second generation (2016–present)|Ford GT]], therefore violating his purchase agreement.

The shoot concluded in November 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/john-cena-jackie-chan-project-xtraction/|title=John Cena Talks Filming 'Project X-Traction' with Living Legend Jackie Chan|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|access-date=February 24, 2020|date=January 15, 2020}}</ref>

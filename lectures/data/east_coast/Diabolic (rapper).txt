==Biography==
George was born in 1978 in [[Huntington Station, New York|Huntington Station]] on [[Long Island]] and was raised there. He grew up in a lower-middle-class family in a suburban neighborhood. His interest in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] started when he listened to his older brother's hip-hop tapes, featuring artists such as [[EPMD]], [[N.W.A]], and [[Black Sheep (group)|Black Sheep]]. In his early teens, he became interested in [[graffiti]] and writing his own lyrics.

In late 1999, he took his talent to the New York City underground and made a name for himself in a number of high-profile battles in the New York City venue, the Wetlands.
      
In 2003, Immortal Technique was touring nationally and supported him. Diabolic was working on his debut album entitled ''[[Liar & A Thief|Liar & a Thief]]'' and found a producer in Vancouver named [[Engineer]]. They worked heavily together and released ''[[Liar & A Thief|Liar & a Thief]]''. He was featured on a [[King Syze]] album ''Collective Bargaining'', the song was titled ''The Strike Line'' and featured [[Army of the Pharaohs]].

On January 28, 2012, Diabolic confirmed the launch of his own record label, "WarHorse Records".

On February 10, 2012, Diabolic released a diss track to [[Tyler, the Creator]] over the instrumental of Tyler's own "[[Yonkers (song)|Yonkers]]". The track was a response to the title track of ''Goblin'', where Tyler mentions Immortal Technique.

In 2016, a feud was ignited between Diabolic and a fellow New York rapper, [[Talib Kweli]]. After a back-and-forth on [[Twitter]] in April in which Diabolic accused Kweli of making generalizations about "White Rappers", Kweli penned an article in May titled ''When ‘White Fragility’ Affects Rappers'', in which he discussed his views on white rappers and referenced Diabolic.

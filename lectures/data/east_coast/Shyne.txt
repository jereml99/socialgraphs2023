'''Moses Michael Levi Barrow''' (born '''Jamal Michael Barrow''', best known by his stage name '''Shyne'''; November 8, 1978) is a [[Belize]]an rapper and politician.<ref name="orthodoxshyne">[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/60620/orthodox-rapper-shyne-wooing-kanye-jay-z "Orthodox rapper Shyne wooing Kanye, Jay-Z"], ''J.'', January 28, 2011.; retrieved January 27, 2011.</ref><ref name="name1">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxFz5CzSjRg |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/LxFz5CzSjRg| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=Shyne Speaks Since Release 2009 at 5:53|date=November 3, 2009|access-date=November 15, 2009|publisher=Shyne, [[Youtube.com]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He is the [[Leader of the Opposition (Belize)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the Belize House of Representatives, and the leader of the [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|Belize United Democratic Party]]. Barrow was born in Belize, but moved to [[Brooklyn]] in New York City as a child, and began to rap as a teenager. He is perhaps best known for his 2000 singles “[[Bad Boyz]]" and "[[Bonnie & Shyne]]". He also wrote and performed on a number of [[Multi-platinum|multi-platinum albums]], such as Usher's ''[[Confessions (Usher album)|Confessions]]'', Lil Wayne's ''[[Tha Carter IV|Carter IV]]'', Notorious B.I.G's ''[[Born Again (The Notorious B.I.G. album)|Born Again]]'', Mase's ''[[Double Up (Mase album)|Double Up]]'', and [[Puff Daddy]]'s ''[[Forever (Puff Daddy album)|Forever]]'' among other top-selling albums during his tenures with his former labels, [[Bad Boy Records]] and [[Def Jam Recordings]].

Shyne and his mother lived in the Brooklyn neighborhood of [[East Flatbush]], where after he was  discovered as he was singing in a barbershop, he became a musician and rapper. On the verge of releasing his debut album, on the evening of {{nowr|December 27, 1999}}, he went to a nightclub with his mentor/label boss [[Sean Combs]], and Combs' then-girlfriend singer/actress [[Jennifer Lopez]]. An argument broke out in the club between Combs and another man, guns were drawn, shots fired, and three bystanders were injured. In June&nbsp;2001 he was convicted of assault, and sentenced to 10&nbsp;years in prison. His 2000 debut album was nevertheless a success, and he continued to record music while incarcerated.

While serving his prison sentence, Shyne became interested in [[Judaism]], became observant&nbsp;– practicing [[Orthodox Judaism]], and  officially changed his name to '''Moses Michael Levi Barrow''' in 2006. After he was released from prison in 2009, he was deported to Belize. In 2010, he moved to [[Jerusalem]], where he spent his time studying the [[Torah]] up to 12 hours a day. He returned to Belize in 2013, and was appointed the Belize Music and Goodwill Ambassador, charged with the sustainable development of the music industry in Belize, and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop it.

Shyne was elected to the [[House of Representatives (Belize)|Belizean House of Representatives]] in the 2020 general election, as a member of the center-right [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|Belize United Democratic Party]]. He became the [[Leader of the Opposition (Belize)|Belize Leader of the Opposition]] in the House of Representatives and the leader of the Belize United Democratic Party, in both June 2021 (until September 2021) and February 2022.

Describing his nine years of incarceration, Shyne said: 
<blockquote>
The entire process was devastating.... ten hours of incarceration is ten hours too much. So, for a human being to be animalized for ten years, there is no quick fix to that.... It's like being shot by an assailant, and you are running away for your life. You didn't even realize you got shot in your leg because you are running on adrenaline. It's not until you get to a place of safety that you realize you have a hole in your leg, and you collapse; you can't stand up, and that was that experience was for me. When I came out I didn't even realize how wounded and devastated I was because I numbed myself to the pain and destruction that I suffered.

I remember my mother used to come and see me on the visit floor. My mother couldn't look at me; she would start to shake, and she would go off the floor and go to the bathroom. I couldn't process that because if I cried in front of her then that would make her life go to shambles. If I cried in front of the prison guard, they would think that I was weak. So I go back to the yard and lift some weights, smoke a cigar, and act like nothing happened.

When you come out from that, how do you recover ...? How do you put back your life together?<ref>[http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=22138 "Shyne Speaks For the First Time Since Deportation,"] 7NewsBelize, April 2, 2012.</ref></blockquote>

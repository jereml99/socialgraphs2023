== Life and career ==
=== Early life and career beginnings ===
Smith was born in [[The Bronx]], and grew up in [[Castle Hill, Bronx|Castle Hill Projects]]. She was exposed to her family's [[drug abuse]] at an early age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/remy-ma-talks-love-and-motherhood-interview-403|title=Remy Ma Talks Love and Motherhood [Interview] |website=www.ebony.com|date=July 22, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref> She was forced to take care of her younger brothers and sisters at a young age and retreated from her home life issues by writing poetry. Her reputation spread around the Bronx, eventually getting the attention of [[Big Pun]]. After a meeting and [[freestyle rap|freestyle]] session, Pun took Ma under his wing and became her mentor.<ref name="sing1">{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Remy-Ma-Biography/2360A63B23EA755A48257118000938BD|title=Remy Ma Biography|publisher=Sing365.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203112517/http://sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Remy-Ma-Biography/2360A63B23EA755A48257118000938BD|archive-date=February 3, 2009|url-status=dead|access-date=May 16, 2010}}</ref> Ma kickstarted her singing career under the name "Remy Martin" on Big Pun's album ''[[Yeeeah Baby]]'', where she was featured on the tracks "Ms. Martin" and "You Was Wrong".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SCCO |title=Yeeeah Baby: Big Pun: Music |website=Amazon |access-date=May 16, 2010}}</ref>

=== ''True Story'', ''There's Something About Remy: Based on a True Story'' (2004–2006) ===
After the death of [[Big Pun]], rapper [[Fat Joe]] signed Ma to his imprint label under [[SRC Records|SRC]] and [[Universal Records|Universal]] where she became a member of his hip hop group [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]]. She appeared on their second and final album, ''[[True Story (Terror Squad album)|True Story]]'', released on July 27, 2004. Their single, "[[Lean Back]]", topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks from August 21, 2004, garnered Ma her first Grammy nomination.

On February 7, 2006, Ma released her debut album ''[[There's Something About Remy: Based on a True Story]]'', which was supported by the singles "[[Whuteva]]", "[[Conceited (There's Something About Remy)|Conceited]]" and "[[Feels So Good (Remy Ma song)|Feels So Good]]". The album was a critical success, however a disappointment financially, moving 37,000 units in its opening week and 158,000 units within the first year. Remy was frustrated at the way the album was being promoted by Universal and tensions between her and the label caused a rift between Ma and Fat Joe. Ma and Universal parted ways, and she severed her associations with Joe and the Terror Squad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2017/06/remy-ma-interview|title=The Rise and Fall and Rise of Remy Ma|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref>

== Legal issues ==
On July 13, 2007, Smith turned herself in to New York City police in relation to a shooting early that morning outside a Manhattan [[delicatessen]]. Police say that while she was with a group of people outside the Pizza Bar, a Manhattan nightspot, a verbal confrontation broke out at 4 a.m. During the incident, a gunshot to the torso wounded Makeda Barnes-Joseph, who had been accused of stealing three thousand dollars from Smith.<ref>Sophia Chang, [http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-nyrap0715,0,5883522.story?coll=ny-top-headlines Rapper Remy Ma sought in shooting], [[Associated Press|AP]], July 14, 2007.</ref> Police sources indicate that Barnes-Joseph later identified Smith as the shooter.<ref>Veronika Belenkaya, Warren Woodberry Jr, Dorian Block, and Robert F.

On March 27, 2008, Smith was convicted of assault, illegal weapon possession and attempted coercion in connection with these charges. She was immediately taken into custody pending sentencing scheduled for May 13. She was acquitted of witness tampering and gang assault.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/nyregion/28remy.html|title = Hip-Hop Star Remy Ma Convicted in '07 Shooting|newspaper = The New York Times|date = March 28, 2008|last1 = Hartocollis|first1 = Anemona}}</ref> At her sentencing, the judge noted her disregard for the victim following the shooting—commenting that the rapper rifled through the victim's purse looking for the alleged stolen money, as Barnes-Joseph sat seriously wounded in the car. Smith then exited the vehicle, jumped into a waiting car and drove off, leaving Barnes-Joseph bleeding in the front seat. No money was found in Barnes-Joseph's purse.

The shooting caused Barnes-Joseph to undergo several surgeries. In 2007, Barnes-Joseph filed an $80 million civil lawsuit against Smith for damages, along with pain and suffering. According to her lawyers, Smith was serving an eight-year term at the [[Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women]] in [[Bedford Hills, New York]], located in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and was expected to be released in 2015.

== Controversies ==
=== Foxy Brown ===
A beef between Remy Ma and [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]] originated in August 2004, when an interviewer noted to Remy: "Right now, it's a lack of female rappers in the game. Foxy don't got anything going on," Remy Ma responded: "How do I feel about them? Stay wherever they at, don't drop a song, don't do nothing, let me be the only one. I'm having so much fun. I hope they never come out. Nah, I wish everyone the best of luck. Just don't drop when I drop. That's all I got to say. Matter of fact, just don't drop at all. It'll even be better."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Jayson|title=Remy Martin: The Champ Is Here|url=http://allhiphop.com/2004/08/16/remy-martin-the-champ-is-here/|website=[[AllHipHop]]|date=August 16, 2004|access-date=March 28, 2014}}</ref> In September 2004, Remy recalled that after a rap battle with [[Lady Luck (rapper)|Lady Luck]] at Fight Klub, her refusal to "show some type of seniority or respect" to Brown became one of the building blocks in the feud.<ref name="yt3" /><ref name="yt5" /> Remy also recalled that during the incident the two were arguing over a future rap battle, where Brown declined and allegedly stated, "What? A battle? That's for beginners. We sell records in Brooklyn!"<ref name="yt3" /><ref name="yt5" /><ref name="yt1">{{cite web|title=Remy Ma talks about Foxy Brown|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOQ4jDpE7Wc&feature=player_detailpage&t=55 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/nOQ4jDpE7Wc |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=March 28, 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="rhh" /> Remy dissed the rapper, responding, "When the last time you sold a record?

Don't try to degrade what I do."<ref name="yt3" /><ref name="yt5" /> Remy additionally revealed that a prize of over $200,000 was offered to whoever won the rap battle.<ref name="yt1" /><ref name="rhh" />

Another building block to the feud was Remy's recollection of her and Brown coincidentally being interviewed at the same events either "before or after" each other, where she would catch wind of Brown "subliminally" dissing her by making statements like: "I've been doing this for years.

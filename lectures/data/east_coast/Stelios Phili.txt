== Songwriting and production ==
According to an interview with MTV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2011172/asap-ferg-forever-mixtape-breakdown/|title=A$AP Ferg's Ferg Forever Mixtape: A Track-By-Track Breakdown|work=MTV Rap Fix|first=Nadeska|last=Alexis|date=November 29, 2014}}</ref> Stelios Phili met [[rapper]] [[A$AP Ferg]] while working at [[GQ]] in 2013. The two began collaborating after fellow A$AP Mob member A$AP Nast passed along one of the producer's beats, which would later become the A$AP Ferg song "Ja-Rule" featuring [[Big Sean]]. In 2014, Phili produced the first single from A$AP Ferg's mixtape, ''[[Ferg Forever]]''. The song, "Doe-Active", was met with positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=Matthew|title=A$AP Ferg, "Doe-Active"|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17223-aap-ferg-doe-active/|website=Pitchfork.com|publisher=Pitchfork|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Breihan|first1=Tom|title=A$AP Ferg – "Doe-Active"|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1719211/aap-ferg-doe-active/video/|website=Stereogum|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Garvey|first1=Meaghan|title=Listen to A$AP Ferg's "Doe-Active"|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/11/asap-ferg-doe-active|website=Complex.com|publisher=Complex Media}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=Joe|title=A$AP FERG – "DOE-ACTIVE"|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2014/11/aap-ferg-doe-active/|website=Pigeons & Planes|publisher=Complex Media}}</ref> [[Pitchfork Media]] described the song as "a minimalist beat that could've slid right into ''Yeezus''", [[Stereogum]] called it "a total nutso banger", and ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' named it a "certified banger, with club-destroying drums". Phili's production was featured on four additional tracks on ''Ferg Forever''.

In 2015, Phili produced DonMonique's debut EP, ''Thirst Trap''. The ''[[New York Times]]'' described it as "full of transfixing slo-mo production by Stelios Phili somewhere between modern-day Internet-rap sparseness and the hard, murky slap of mid-1990s New York street rap."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Caramonica|first1=Jon|title=New Releases From Bea Miller, Sublime With Rome and DonMonique|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/arts/music/new-releases-from-bea-miller-sublime-with-rome-and-donmonique.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|date=29 July 2015|accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>

In 2018, Phili produced the [[Young Thug]] and [[Elton John]] collaboration "High". According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', the song came together after Phili read an interview with Elton John, who expressed his admiration for Young Thug. After Phili built a new beat around an edited version of the "Rocket Man" a cappella, [[300 Entertainment]] A&R Geoff Ogunlesi played the song to Young Thug. On September 24, 2018, "High" was released on his EP ''[[On the Rvn]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Leight|first1=Elias|title=The Long and Surreal Road to Young Thug (and Elton John)'s 'High'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/young-thug-elton-john-high-rocket-man-sample-727799/|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=25 September 2018|accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref> The song was awarded Best New Music by [[Pitchfork Media]], with [[The Fader]] describing the song's reception as "swift and rapturous" and "a return to iconoclastic form for Young Thug."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pierce|first1=Sheldon|title=Best New Track: Young Thug High ft.

== Musical style ==

Phili's production style is described as fresh and understated. According to ''[[Pigeons & Planes]]'', "Stelios Phili is one of those producers you can recognize from the jump—he utilizes a unique collection of sounds that is both muted and aggressive: murky synths and pillowy cymbal taps are cut by a fierce snare, or a saxophone seamlessly transforms into an electric guitar. It's all about subtlety with SP, and he's got it down to a science."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Jacob|title=10 RAP PRODUCERS YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW (BUT SHOULD)|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2015/07/new-rap-producers-2015/s/stelios-phili/|website=Pigeons and Planes|publisher=Complex.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref>

In 2021, Drama narrated [[Tyler, the Creator]]'s album ''[[Call Me If You Get Lost]]'', and was credited as a feature on the first track [[Sir Baudelaire]]. The album's "intros" and sound was partly inspired by Drama's "Gangsta Grillz" series, and is often credited as a nod to that "mixtape" sound.

A further instalment of the Gangsta Grillz series, ''D-Day: A Gangsta Grillz Mixtape'', was released on March 31, 2022, in collaboration with [[Dreamville]] and [[J. Cole]].

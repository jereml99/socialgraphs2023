'''Luis Cedeño''' (born August 11, 1961), more commonly known as '''DJ Disco Wiz'''  is an American [[Disc jockey|DJ]].

He is noted as being the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] DJ in [[Hip-Hop]].<ref name="hess"/>

== Old School ==
He was born in the [[Bronx]], [[New York City]], United States, to a [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] father and a mother from [[Cuba]].

After being inspired at a [[Kool Herc]] jam by the emerging [[hip hop]] movement taking place in [[The Bronx]], DJ Disco Wiz collaborated with his best friend, Casanova Fly ([[Grandmaster Caz]]), to form a group called the ''Mighty Force'' crew. ''Mighty Force'' is noted as being one of the first Hip-Hop DJ crews in the mid-to-late 1970s. Noted for their DJ battles in the streets of the [[South Bronx]], the ''Mighty Force'' crew was also responsible for presenting the first [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] rapper to the world, [[Prince Whipper Whip]], who is also of [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] descent. DJ Disco Wiz is also credited for being the first DJ to create a "mixed plate" in 1977 (Hip-Hop's first mixed dub recording) when he and Grandmaster Caz, combined sound bites, special effects and paused beats.<ref name="hess">{{Cite book |first=Mickey |last=Hess |title=Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide |date=2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page= xxxiii |isbn=978-0-313-34323-0 }}</ref>

==New School==
The grandson of the late Puerto Rican artist and Santero Norberto Cedeño; (''[[La Mano Poderosa]]'', 1950), Wiz is the creator of "The Hip-Hop Meets Spoken Wordz" series, a [[hip hop]] and [[poetry]] performance series that gives a voice to up-and-coming Latino talent in [[New York City]]. As a poet, DJ Disco Wiz has performed at the [[Apollo Theater]] and the landmark [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]] and his poetry can be seen in the upcoming book ''[[Born in the Bronx]]''. Wiz also appears in a few [[documentaries]] on hip-hop history including ''[[1 LOVE]]'', a film produced by noted hip-hop historian [[James Rodriguez|James "Koe" Rodriguez]] about the lives of [[Joe Conzo]], [[Ernie Paniccioli]], and [[Jamel Shabazz]]—hip-hop's first photographers.

Wiz has openly contributed to the community education of the formative years of hip-hop. In the millennium issue of ''[[The Source Magazine]]'' he candidly shared his experience in being the first Latino during the culture's evolution. He was also a major contributor in the opening of the [[Experience Music Project]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] in 2000. His contribution and donation of original hip-hop flyers, solely for the preservation of hip-hop can be seen as part of the archives. He was also instrumental in the making of Jim Fricke and Charlie Ahearn's rendition of the early years of hip-hop entitled ''[[Yes, Yes Y’all]]''; sharing numerous original flyers and first-hand accounts of the early years of hip-hop including an account of the historical [[New York City blackout of 1977]].

He is also a board member of the Universal Federation for the Preservation of Hip Hop Culture, chaired by [[Afrika Bambaataa]] of the [[Universal Zulu Nation]]. The Federation also includes on its board; [[Grandmaster Caz]], [[DJ Tony Tone]], [[Kurtis Blow]], GrandMaster [[Melle Mel]], [[KRS-One]], [[Lovebug Starski]], [[Jorge Pabon|Jorge “PopMaster Fabel” Pabon]], and photographer Joe Conzo.

Wiz co-authored his memoirs with [[Simon & Schuster]] author Ivan Sanchez. The book is titled ''It’s Just Begun: The Epic Journey of DJ Disco Wiz, Hip-Hop’s First Latino DJ''. The book was released on the Miss Rosen imprint of [[powerHouse Books]] in 2009.

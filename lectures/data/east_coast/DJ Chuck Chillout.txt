'''Charles Turner'''<ref name="allmusic">[http://allmusic.com/artist/dj-chuck-chillout-p26276 DJ Chuck Chillout at allmusic.com]</ref> (born October 21, 1962) better known as '''DJ Chuck Chillout''', is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]] and [[Record producer|producer]].

==Biography==
He began his career on [[New York City]]'s [[WEPN-FM#As WRKS (1981-2012)|WRKS 98.7 Kiss FM]] radio station in 1982. He was one of the first hip-hop artists to become established, which also includes [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Salt-n-Pepa]], and [[Slick Rick]]. “[[Hip hop music|Hip-hop]] was fun and energetic during this time. Hip-hop was just growing, so there was a lot of creativity and great live performances,” says Chuck. “Run-DMC and [[Whodini]] were some of the best live performances during this time”.<ref>''The Source'' Magazine, November 2004, "Hip Hop Iconz Volume 9: Chuck Chillout Breaking The Ice," pp.&nbsp;78–80.</ref>

After leaving Kiss FM in 1989, Chuck joined [[WBLS|107.5 WBLS FM]] in 1990 for two years. Chuck worked in 1995 by becoming one of the first DJs to play hip hop music in [[Japan]]. Hip-hop artists such as [[Busta Rhymes]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and Run-D.M.C. became known in Japan as a result. "Hip hop was very popular in Japan", said Chuck, "The people there knew the history of the artist I was playing as well as mine. Japanese people were totally into the culture".

In 1989, he released an album with emcee Kool Chip called ''[[Masters of the Rhythm]]'', which was released by Mercury/PolyGram Records. The album featured two regional hits, "Rhythm is the Master" and "I’m Large."

In 1996, Chuck helped [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] for his debut smash hit, "Get at Me, Dog".

Chuck established Full Blast Promotions in 1999. "I established Full Blast Promotions in New Jersey because there was a need for a premier record pool in New Jersey," Chuck stated.

Chuck's affiliation with old- and new-school hip hop and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] has helped him remain a popular DJ. Most recently, his participation in the [[Essence Music Festival]] and cruise helped his career.

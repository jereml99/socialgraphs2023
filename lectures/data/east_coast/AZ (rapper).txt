'''Anthony Cruz''' (born March 9, 1972), better known by his stage name '''AZ''', is an American [[rapping|rapper]] known for being a longtime and frequent music partner of East Coast rapper [[Nas]] and also a member of hip hop group [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]] alongside Nas, [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Cormega]] and [[Nature (rapper)|Nature]]. Online magazine [[Dotdash|About.com]] listed AZ as the "Most Underrated [Rapper] of All Time".<ref>{{cite web|last=Adaso |first=Henry |url=http://rap.about.com/od/artist1/ss/UnderratedMCs_10.htm |title=10 Most Underrated Rappers |publisher=About.com:Rap/Hip-Hop |date=June 3, 2010 |access-date=October 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413090949/http://rap.about.com/od/artist1/ss/UnderratedMCs_10.htm |archive-date=April 13, 2014 }}</ref> AZ also made it onto the sites' "Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007)", where he was reiterated as "arguably the most underrated lyricist ever."

AZ first became known by appearing on Nas's landmark 1994 album ''[[Illmatic]]'' on the song "[[Life's a Bitch (song)|Life's a Bitch]]", as well as featuring vocals on the opening track "The Genesis". AZ signed with EMI, and soon released his debut album, ''[[Doe or Die]]'', in 1995, to critical acclaim. The album's lead single, "Sugar Hill", became AZ's major commercial success as a solo artist, reaching #25 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and achieving [[RIAA certification|Gold]] status. AZ's [[EMI]] contract was transferred to sister label [[Noo Trybe Records]] and [[Virgin Records]] when the EMI Label Group was shut down.

In 1997, AZ joined the group The Firm with Nas, Nature and Foxy Brown and released their only album as a group, ''[[The Album (The Firm album)|The Album]]''. In 1998, AZ released his second solo album, ''[[Pieces of a Man (AZ album)|Pieces of a Man]]''. The album fared well but did not chart quite as well as his debut and did not feature a crossover single like "Sugar Hill".

After this album's release, AZ signed with [[Motown]] and [[Universal Music Group|Universal Records]] and released ''[[9 Lives (AZ album)|9 Lives]]''.<ref name="ALLMUSIC">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p14943/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic Biography]</ref> In 2002, he released ''[[Aziatic]]''. A single from the album, "The Essence" (featuring Nas), was nominated at the [[45th Grammy Awards|2003 Grammy Awards]] for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

== Early life ==
AZ was born in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]]<ref name=":1" /> to an African-American mother and a [[Afro-Dominicans|Afro-Dominican]] father. He grew up in [[East New York, Brooklyn]], with his mother and sister.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0">''#20YrsLtr: Doe or Die'' (2016)</ref>

AZ started writing rap lyrics when he was 12 years old.<ref name=":0" /> He attended Eli Whitney High School, with fellow Brooklyn rapper [[Jay-Z]], until the vocational school closed down in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kollegekidd.com/news/rapper-az-says-he-battled-jay-z-in-high-school/|title=Rapper AZ Says He Battled Jay-Z In High School|date=June 14, 2013}}</ref> 
In the early 1990s, he became friends with [[Nas]], a young rapper from [[Queens]].<ref name=":1">Anthony Cruz: ''Jewels, Gems & Treasures''. Quiet Money Publishing, 2015.</ref> Nas started working on his debut album ''[[Illmatic]]'' and invited  AZ to work with him in the studio. AZ appeared on the album intro and had a verse on "[[Life's a Bitch (song)|Life's a Bitch]]". After ''Illmatic'' was released in 1994, [[EMI Records]] offered AZ a record deal.<ref name=":1" />

[[File:Az-06.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|AZ performing in 1997]]
AZ's debut album ''[[Doe or Die]]'' was released by EMI Records on October 10, 1995. It features guest appearances by Nas and production from [[N.O. Joe]], [[Pete Rock]], [[L.E.S. (record producer)|L.E.S.]], and [[Buckwild (music producer)|Buckwild]], among others. Upon its release, ''Doe or Die'' received notable commercial success, peaking at #15 on the Billboard 200, and #1 on the U.S. Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} ''Doe or Die'' was known for popularizing the theme of mafioso rap, alongside several albums, namely [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'' and [[Nas]]'s ''[[It Was Written]]''. Doe or Die produced several singles, including "Mo Money, Mo Murder, Mo Homicide", "Gimme Your's (remix)", "Doe or Die" and "[[Doe or Die|Sugar Hill]]" – which was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1995.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=AZ's 'Doe or Die' Turns 20: Brooklyn Rapper Looks Back on Its History & Impact|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6722887/az-doe-or-die-anniversary-classic-album-interview|date=October 10, 2015|magazine=Billboard|access-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref>

In 1998, ''[[Pieces of a Man (AZ album)|Pieces of a Man]]'', AZ's second album, was released on EMI.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} ''[[9 Lives (AZ album)|9 Lives]]'', his third album, peaked at #23 on the Billboard 200 and #4 on the Top Hip Hop / R&B Albums.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The leading single, "Problems", with its accompanying music video, reached #34 on the Hot Rap Singles.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} After the release of the album, AZ left the label.

=== 2002–2007: ''Aziatic,'' ''A.W.O.L.'' and ''The Format'' ===
AZ's fourth album ''[[Aziatic]]'' features a duet between AZ and long-time friend and collaborator, Nas, "The Essence", which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/content/news_detail.aspx?id=1703700&p=4|title=2003 Grammy Award Nominees Announced|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020075432/http://www.hollywood.com/content/news_detail.aspx?id=1703700&p=4|archive-date=October 20, 2012}}</ref> The album was mostly well received by critics, one such positive review from Brad Mills at Allmusic, states:
"AZ has been looked upon to do amazing things with his music. Has he lived up to those high expectations on this album he has from start to finish. The beats on this album are complex, inventive, and almost perfectly suited for AZ's style of rhyming. He's carefully crafted this album rather than slapped it together overnight to meet his quota, and it shows. It helps immensely that he's brought along people like DR Period, Az Izz, Nas, and Buckwild, but they don't outshine the younger AZ as he holds his own well. AZ has come up with his best work in a long time on this album."{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

On September 6, 2005, ''[[A.W.O.L. (album)|A.W.O.L.]]'', his fifth album, was released, becoming the first AZ album to be released on his own imprint, Quiet Money Records.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

AZ's sixth studio album ''[[The Format (album)|The Format]]'' features production from [[Lil' Fame]] of [[M.O.P.]], Face Defeat, Emile, J. Cardim, Phonte, Statik Selektah and DJ Premier.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The album's lead single is its title track "The Format", which was produced by DJ Premier, with "Vendetta" as its B-Side. ''The Format'' also features the bonus track "Royal Salute", a retaliation to 50 Cent's song "What If" which included a line aimed at AZ.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} On October 7, 2007, Quiet Money released ''The Format (Special Edition)'', adding six bonus tracks including "Royal Salute."{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

=== 2008–present: ''Undeniable, Legendary'' and ''Doe or Die II'' ===
''[[Undeniable (AZ album)|Undeniable]]'', his seventh studio album, was released on April 1, 2008, through Quiet Money and Koch Records. The album debuted at number 141 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling over 25,000 copies in its first week. In October 2009, AZ confirmed he was working on a sequel to his debut studio album, titled ''Doe or Die 2''. He hoped to enlist the original production team from ''[[Doe or Die]]'' such as [[L.E.S. (producer)|L.E.S.]], [[Pete Rock]], DR Period, and [[Buckwild (music producer)|Buckwild]]. AZ also had ambitions on trying to acquire beats from [[DJ Toomp]], [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Kanye West]] for the album, as well as reaching out to his old rhyme partner [[Nas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10323/title.az-wants-dr-dre-kanye-west-and-nas-for-doe-or-die-2|title=AZ Wants Dr. Dre, Kanye West And Nas For Doe Or Die 2|last=Arnold|first=Paul W|date=December 22, 2009|publisher=HipHopDX|access-date=December 26, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225103419/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10323/title.az-wants-dr-dre-kanye-west-and-nas-for-doe-or-die-2|archive-date=December 25, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first single from the album "Feel My Pain" was produced by [[Frank Dukes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://limelinx.com/files/b96ba295f9a05e205cea2df3008e1392 |title=Preview – AZ-Feel_My_Pain_(Prod_Frank_Dukes)-.mp3 |publisher=LimeLinx |access-date=September 15, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301084222/http://limelinx.com/files/b96ba295f9a05e205cea2df3008e1392|archive-date=March 1, 2012}}</ref>

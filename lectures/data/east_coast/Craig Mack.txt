'''Craig Jamieson Mack''' (May 10, 1970<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|date=March 13, 2018|title=Craig Mack, 'Flava in Ya Ear' Rapper, Is Dead at 47|language=en-US|work= [[The New York Times]] | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/obituaries/craig-mack-flava-in-ya-ear-dead.html|access-date=October 5, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> – March 12, 2018) was an American rapper and record producer, and was famous during his tenure under [[Bad Boy Records]].

==Early life and career==
{{expand section| date= July 2022}}
Craig Jamieson Mack was born in [[The Bronx]], New York, and raised on [[Long Island]].<ref name= ":0" /> He began rapping as a teenager under the name MC EZ. His first single, "Get Retarded", was released in 1988 via [[Fresh Records (US)|Fresh Records]]. The single was backed with and credited as MC EZ & Troup.

Mack became friends with fellow Long Island hip hop act [[EPMD]] and eventually went on tour with the duo, doing jobs as a [[Road crew|roadie]]. After a few years without forward movement in his recording career and EPMD's breakup, Mack took advantage of an opportunity that Alvin Toney made possible for him to rap for [[Sean Combs]]. Mack then secured a record deal with Combs's newly founded label, [[Bad Boy Records]].

Mack is best known for his 1994 hit single "[[Flava in Ya Ear]]", which was released under his real name. The [[remix]] of the single was the breakout appearance of [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], as well as one of the first solo appearances by [[Busta Rhymes]].<ref name= ":1">{{Cite web|last=Thompson|first=Paul|date=March 13, 2018|title=Remembering Craig Mack, Bad Boy's Forgotten First Success Story|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/craig-mack-bad-boys-rap-obituary.html|access-date=October 5, 2020| website= [[Vulture.com]] |language=en-us}}</ref> While Mack was technically the first rapper to release music on Bad Boy Records,<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=March 19, 2018|title=How Craig Mack helped secure Bad Boy Records' place in hip-hop history| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/craig-mack-dead-died-new-york-hip-hop-rapper-bad-boy-records-sean-combs-puff-dad-notorious-b-i-g-a8263131.html|access-date=October 5, 2020|website= [[The Independent]] |language=en}}</ref> the success of The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album ''[[Ready to Die]]'', which released exactly seven days before Mack's debut album ''[[Project: Funk da World]]'', overshadowed Mack's early success on the label.<ref name=":1" />

Although Sean Combs mentioned in a 1994 interview on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'' that he was working with Mack on his second album, which was to be released sometime in January 1995, this proved to not be the case. Present at that interview (which also included The Notorious B.I.G.), Mack himself appeared puzzled by the statement. Mack did release a second album in 1997 without Bad Boy, but none of the singles charted and Mack was unable to repeat his success. In an interview, The Notorious B.I.G. says he appeared on the remix of "Flava in Ya Ear" for political reasons for Combs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVv4zGLTsek&t=113 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/LVv4zGLTsek |archive-date=December 13, 2021 |url-status=live|title=Notorious BIG With Lil Cease Interview (Throwback Footage) |via= YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In 2002, Mack would appear in the music video for Puffy's single "[[I Need a Girl (Part One)]]".<ref>{{Cite web|title=P.

After a few attempts to return to success in the early-2000s, it was said that Mack was working on his third studio album in 2002, which was set to be released in 2007.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} The single "Mack Tonight" was released for the album in 2006.

Mack was absent from the hip hop industry until in 2012, when a video was leaked on YouTube saying he had joined a Christian ministry, surprising family members and fans.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Is Craig Mack Part Of A Religious Cult? |url= https://theurbandaily.com/1819075/craig-mack-joins-religious-cult/|access-date=October 5, 2020| website= theurbandaily.com|date=March 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=r/hiphopheads – Wait, so hold up, did Craig Mack join a doomsday cult? |url= https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/3nzk9t/wait_so_hold_up_did_craig_mack_join_a_doomsday/|access-date=October 5, 2020 |website= [[reddit]].com |date=October 8, 2015|language=en-US}}</ref> From 2012 until his death, Mack resided in the Overcomer Ministry located in [[Walterboro, South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web| first= Nicola |last= Menzie |url= http://www.christianpost.com/news/rapper-craig-mack-now-a-christian-testifies-of-leaving-wickedness-for-righteousness-in-church-video-101830/ |title= Rapper Craig Mack, Now a Christian, Testifies of Leaving 'Wickedness' for 'Righteousness' in Church Video| work= [[The Christian Post]]| date= August 8, 2013| publisher= | access-date= }}</ref> The Overcomer Ministry is a secluded Christian commune that has been described as a cult,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> and whose leader [[Brother Stair]] has been charged with various crimes, including assault and sexual conduct with a minor.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last= Schladebeck |first= Jessica |title= Inside the controversial 'cult' where rapper Craig Mack spent his final years| url= https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cult-rapper-craig-mack-spent-final-years-article-1.3872397|access-date=October 5, 2020 |website= [[NY Daily News]]; nydailynews.com|date= March 13, 2018 }}</ref> The Overcomer Ministry's YouTube channel released a video, "Craig Mack Testimony", on May 22, 2016,<ref>{{Citation| author= The Overcomer Ministry|title=Craig Mack Testimony|date=May 22, 2016| via= YouTube | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO5d6iNI_Ck |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160525152828/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO5d6iNI_Ck&gl=US&hl=en |archive-date=May 25, 2016 |url-status=dead|access-date=June 10, 2016}}</ref> in which Mack appears in the middle of the church to rap about Christianity through a remix of "When God Comes".<ref>{{Citation| author= BoomBap4Life | via= YouTube |title=10 – When God Comes – Craig Mack| date= April 10, 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us0nTZXee80 |archive-url= https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/Us0nTZXee80 |archive-date=December 13, 2021 |url-status=live|access-date=June 10, 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The last part of the video entails a full version of the song with better production quality and a beat.

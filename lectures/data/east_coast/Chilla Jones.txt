{{short description|Musician and battle rapper}}
'''Jerome "Chilla" Jones''' is a musician and battle rapper, representing the city of Boston, Massachusetts, as well as New England, every place he steps. At 16, he terrorized the battle circuits across Boston, MA throughout his high school career. Eventually, he would shift focus 100% from battling into the craft of songwriting and music making. From there, he began to build a name for himself locally for his punchline ability and for having genuine and creative song concepts that most of us can relate to. Chilla released 6 solo mixtapes over the course of 3 years. {{Infobox musical artist

One night in February 2011, Chilla received a phone call from a local emcee, '''Gatman Jones''' (Currently known as Sunny Carson)<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sunny Carson {{!}} Hip Hop from Boston, MA|url = https://www.reverbnation.com/sunnycarson|website = ReverbNation|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = en-us}}</ref> calling him out on the radio to a rap battle. After declining multiple times, Chilla decided to accept the challenge, and won the battle in very impressive fashion.<ref>{{Citation|title = Gatman Jones Vs Chilla Jones - Rap Battle At The Dublin!

However Chilla never declined any offers from Canada and was booked for his first "big league" battle in August on 2011 with [[King of the Dot]], on their World Domination 2 event vs Ketch-P, but unfortunately his opponent cancelled on him. Then the Ultimate Rap League, better known as the URL reached out to him and Chilla decided to battle in their new league known as "The Proving Grounds" to help expand the platform of his own league, and in hopes of paving a path to the league for other aspiring battlers from Boston.

Since March 2012, Chilla Jones entered the [https://www.youtube.com/user/theUrltv Ultimate Rap League] and took the battle world by storm. His debut battle was against Cash Eatin out of Detroit, Michigan,<ref>{{Citation|title = SMACK/ URL PRESENTS CHILLA JONES VS CASH EATIN|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vXGf7jhMI4|date = 2012-05-31|accessdate = 2016-02-24|last = Ultimate Rap League}}</ref> and from that battle he sent shock waves through the hip-hop culture with his unique style now branded as "Schemin' " or 'Associated Wordplay' . On the eve of one of the biggest battle rap events in Hip-Hop history (URL's Summer Madness 2), Chilla Jones took on Pontiac's JC in what would become one of the greatest rap battles ever.<ref>{{Cite web|title = JC vs. Chilla Jones {{!}} Battle Rap|url = http://battlerap.com/battles/2015/12/21371-jc-vs-chilla-jones|website = Battle Rap|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = en-US}}</ref> This battle catapulted Chilla to new heights and he gained tons of notoriety off of his performance. The self-proclaimed "Mr. Jump to Top Tier from the Proving Grounds",<ref>{{Citation|title = SMACK/URL PRESENTS DNA VS CHILLA JONES [FULL BATTLE]|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlg8ryZUFb0&t=41m4s|date = 2013-07-18|accessdate = 2016-02-24|last = Ultimate Rap League}}</ref> after his battles with JC and B.Magic, was now a name targeted by up and comers and veterans alike.

After spending much of the last 3 years focused on building his brand through battle rap, Chilla is now working to balance both the music and the battling to prove he is a double threat and can be successful in either field. He released the "Welcome to Bosstown" mixtape in September 2014,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chilla Jones - Welcome To Bosstown Hosted by DJ 2Thirteen|url = http://www.datpiff.com/Chilla-Jones-Welcome-To-Bosstown-mixtape.643400.html|website = DatPiff|access-date = 2016-02-24}}</ref> which shows his versatility musically and features songs of all different concepts and styles. On the battling side, he has remained consistently great, having main event battles in Holyoke Ma,<ref>{{Cite web|title = KOTD & Nikiya Osborn Announce Full "Massacre" Card {{!}} Battle Rap|url = http://battlerap.com/news/2015/04/11785-kotd-nikiya-osborn-announce-full-massacre-card|website = Battle Rap|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = en-US}}</ref> New York City,<ref>{{Cite web|title = RBE Announces "Blood Sweat & Tiers 3" & "Lift His Soul 2" Cards {{!}} Battle Rap|url = http://battlerap.com/news/2015/08/16441-rbe-announces-blood-sweat-tiers-3-lift-his-soul-2-cards|website = Battle Rap|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = en-US}}</ref> London,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Don't Flop 7th Birthday Weekend {{!}} Don't Flop Entertainment {{!}} VerseTracker|url = http://versetracker.com/event/dont-flop-dont-flop-7th-birthday-weekend|website = VerseTracker|access-date = 2016-02-24|archive-date = 2016-03-03|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303014544/http://versetracker.com/event/dont-flop-dont-flop-7th-birthday-weekend|url-status = dead}}</ref> Atlanta,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Math Hoffa Returns For Don't Flop's "Resurrection" {{!}} Battle Rap|url = http://battlerap.com/news/2015/03/10286-math-hoffa-returns-for-dont-flops-resurrection|website = Battle Rap|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = en-US}}</ref> and LA<ref>{{Cite web|title = Dizaster To Return To KOTD Against Chilla Jones {{!}} Battle Rap|url = http://battlerap.com/news/2015/06/14685-dizaster-set-to-return-against-chilla-jones|website = Battle Rap|access-date = 2016-02-24|language = en-US}}</ref> all since April 2015.

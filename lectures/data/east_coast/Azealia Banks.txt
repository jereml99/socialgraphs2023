'''Azealia Amanda Banks''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|z|i:|l|i|ə}} {{Respell|ə|ZEE|lee|ə}}; born May 31, 1991) is an American rapper, singer and songwriter. Raised in the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of New York City, she began releasing music through [[Myspace]] in 2008 before being signed to [[XL Recordings]] at age 18. She subsequently signed with [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] and [[Polydor Records]] before separating in 2013. Banks became an independent artist and started her own independent record label, Chaos & Glory Recordings. She is currently signed to [[Parlophone]] and [[Warner Records]]. 

Banks's song "[[212 (song)|212]]" has been listed as one of the best songs of 2011 and one of the defining songs of the decade by music publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. She has since released two mixtapes (''[[Fantasea (mixtape)|Fantasea]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Slay-Z]]'' in 2016), a studio album (''[[Broke with Expensive Taste]]'' in 2014), and two extended plays (''[[1991 (Azealia Banks EP)|1991]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Icy Colors Change]]'' in 2018). In 2017, Banks had her film debut in the musical drama ''[[Love Beats Rhymes]]'', portraying the lead character. Banks's works have garnered acclaim from critics, drawing on various sounds including [[House (genre)|house]], [[rap]], [[pop (genre)|pop]], [[electronic music]], and [[avant-garde]].

Throughout her career, Banks's [[social media]] presence and outspoken views, especially on [[Politics of the United States|U.S. politics]] and [[Race (human categorization)|race]], as well as disputes with other artists,<ref name=":0" /> have attracted significant controversy.<ref name="beefs">{{cite web |last1=Diep |first1=Eric |last2=Ortiz |first2=Edwin |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2014/06/a-history-of-azealia-banks-twitter-beefs/ |title=A History of Azealia Banks' Twitter Beefs |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=June 19, 2014}}</ref><ref name="The Independent">{{Cite news |last=Oppenheim |first=Maya |date=2016-05-12 |title=A brief history of Azealia Banks public feuds |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/azealia-banks-a-brief-history-of-the-rappers-public-feuds-and-tirades-a7026016.html |access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' noted in 2014 that "she gets more attention for her public feuds than she does for her music".<ref name="beefs" />

==Life and career==
===Early life and career beginnings===
Azealia Amanda Banks was born on May 31, 1991, in New York City's [[Manhattan]] borough; she was the youngest of three.<ref name="xxlmag22ndbirthday">{{cite web|last=Diep|first=Eric|title=Today in Hip-Hop: Azealia Banks Celebrates 22nd Birthday|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/hip-hop-today/2013/05/today-in-hip-hop-azealia-banks-celebrates-22nd-birthday/|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=May 31, 2013|access-date=August 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=D.L.|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2012/12/24/azealia-banks-hints-at-retirement-promises-2-lps-in-2013-video/|title=Azealia Banks Hints at Retirement, Promises 2 LPs in 2013 [VIDEO]|publisher=Hip-Hop Wired|date=December 24, 2012|access-date=December 30, 2012}}</ref> Her single mother raised her and her two siblings in [[Harlem]], after their father died of [[pancreatic cancer]] when she was two years old.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite web|author=Ortved, John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/fashion/azealia-banks-a-young-rapper-taking-cues-from-the-street.html?_r=3&ref=fashion&|title=Azealia Banks, a Young Rapper Taking Cues From the Street|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 1, 2012|access-date=November 17, 2012}}</ref> Following her father's death, Banks says that her mother "became really abusive—physically and verbally. Like she would hit me and my sisters with baseball bats, bang our heads up against walls, and she would always tell me I was ugly. I remember once she threw out all the food in the fridge, just so we wouldn't have anything to eat." Due to escalating violence, Banks moved out of her mother's home at age 14 to live with her older sister.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sciortino|first=Karley|title=Azealia Banks: Fighting Talk|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/14493/1/azealia-banks-fighting-talk|magazine=Dazed & Confused|access-date=January 24, 2019|date=September 15, 2012}}</ref>

At a young age, Banks became interested in musical theater, dancing, acting, and singing. At 16, she starred in a production of the comedy-noir musical ''[[City of Angels (musical)|City of Angels]]'', where she was found by an agent who sent her to auditions for [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[Nickelodeon]], and ''[[Law & Order]]'', all without success.<ref name="Spin">{{cite web|last=Baron|first=Zach|date=August 28, 2012|title=The Making of Azealia Banks|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/08/azealia-banks-spin-issue-story/|access-date=October 28, 2017|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref> At this point Banks decided to end her pursuit of an acting career, citing the stiff competition and overall sense of nonfulfillment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azealia Banks interview – BBC Sound of 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc1zevdRivA| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211108/hc1zevdRivA| archive-date=November 8, 2021 | url-status=live|publisher=YouTube.com|access-date=January 27, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Because of this lack of fulfillment, she began writing rap and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs as a creative outlet. She never finished high school, instead choosing to follow her dream of becoming a recording artist.<ref name="xxlmag22ndbirthday" />

Under the moniker Miss Bank$, she released her debut recording, "Gimme a Chance" online on November 9, 2008.<ref name="Spin"/> The recording was accompanied by the self-produced track "Seventeen", which sampled the [[Ladytron]] song of the [[Seventeen (Ladytron song)|same name]].

I went into a bit of a depression.|salign=right|source=—Banks talking of her departure from XL Recordings<ref name="xl"/>}} After leaving XL Recordings, Banks dropped the 'Miss Bank$' moniker and formally became Azealia Banks, which preceded a move to [[Montreal]]. Using YouTube as a portal, she uploaded several demo tracks, including "L8R" and a cover of "[[Slow Hands (Interpol song)|Slow Hands]]" by [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]]. After her Canadian [[visa (document)|visa]] expired, Banks returned to New York, where she sold keychains at a Manhattan jazz club and danced at a [[Queens]] strip club to make ends meet.<ref name="Spin"/> "That's when I was really depressed", Banks said. "I don't have a manager, I don't have a boyfriend, I don't have any friends, I don't have any money.

In September 2011, Banks released her debut single, "[[212 (song)|212]]", as a free digital download from her website.

Since writing "212", Banks has adopted an alter ego, "Yung Rapunxel". This alter ego was adapted from Banks calling herself [[Rapunzel]] due to a long [[Artificial hair integrations|weave]] she wore while working at [[Starbucks]] as a teenager. Banks discussed this with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' saying, "Yung Rapunxel is that girl who pisses people off but doesn't really mean to. She's actually a sweetheart! But people are so taken aback that she's so herself; she's not even trying to be unique or different. She literally just lives in her head; she does what she wants to do. So, the lipstick is here for someone who is happy to be themself."<ref name="rollingstone" />

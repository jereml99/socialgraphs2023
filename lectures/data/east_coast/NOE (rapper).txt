==Biography==

===2005: Early life and career beginnings===
Bridgeford was born and raised in the inner city of [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. NOE's early adult years were engulfed in the violence and dilapidated neighborhoods that continue to blanket Baltimore City. During a phone interview while at a New York recording studio, Bridgeford wasn't very candid about growing up in East Baltimore. He opts not to mention the name of his high school, and sums up his criminal history as "two arrests, one was for drugs, one was for a gun violation, all in all I did about three years." He does mention that he regrets not being closer to his family, and looks at that rift as the reason he decided to express himself through poetry. In 2002 Bridgeford relocated from Baltimore to [[New York City]] in search of a [[Recording contract|record deal]].<ref name="BaltimoreCityPaper">{{cite web|url=http://www2.citypaper.com/arts/review.asp?rid=11747 |title=Local Rapper Duane Bridgeford Slowly Makes a Name For Himself|last=Torres|first=Jason|year=2007|publisher=[[Baltimore City Paper]]|accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>

After being rejected by [[A&R]] men throughout the business for sounding like [[Jay-Z]], Bridgeford's business partner Nicole "Nicety" Chaplin, who worked with [[Dipset]] President [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]] while he was still signed to Jay-Z's [[Roc-A-Fella]] label, introduced the two. Chaplin also introduced Bridgeford to Conrad Dimanche, senior vice president at [[Bad Boy Records]], who was impressed with his work but not interested in signing a new act: "[Dimanche] just told me to start writing, and it just so happened that [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] was working on the Danity Kane project," Bridgeford says. "Writing is where the money is at. There's less scrutiny. I don't have to worry about sounding like anybody or whatever." He went on to [[Ghostwriter|write]] Diddy's lyrics for [[Danity Kane]]'s debut single "[[Show Stopper (Danity Kane song)|Show Stopper]]". Working with Diddy has also given him a chance to work side by side with Jay-Z. "It was a real professional situation," Bridgeford says. "He was doing the hook on a song that ended up not being on the Danity Kane album, and I had to come through to write the lyrics."<ref name="BaltimoreCityPaper"/>

==Career==

===1996–1998: Career beginnings===
In 1995, Jean was discovered by [[George Rithm Martinez]] when he recruited the artist for a five-song demo in his group Ground Zero. The demo earned "Unsigned Hype" honors in ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' in March 1996.<ref name=Warren /> Jean later joined a hip hop group called Natural Resource<ref name="Warren" /> along with rapper Ocean and [[disc jockey]] James "AGGIE" Barrett. In 1996, they released two [[12-inch single]]s on their label, Makin' Records.<ref name="allmusic" /> They appeared on singles by [[Pumpkinhead (rapper)|Pumpkinhead]] and Bad Seed, as well as on the O.B.S. (Original Blunted Soldiers) double [[12-inch single]]. They produced much of the material released under pseudonym "Run Run Shaw".

===1998–2004: Solo career===
Natural Resource dissolved in 1998, after which Jean changed her [[stage name]] from What? What? to Jean Grae, a reference to the [[X-Men]] character [[Jean Grey]].<ref name="Crockett">Crockett, Stephen A., Jr. (2008), "[http://www.theroot.com/views/graes-anatomy Grae's Anatomy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729024320/http://www.theroot.com/views/graes-anatomy |date=2009-07-29 }}", ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]'', August 12, 2008.</ref> Jean released the [[Vinyl record|LP]], ''Attack of the Attacking Things,'' on August 6, 2002, and released ''[[This Week (album)|This Week]]'' on September 21, 2004.<ref name="Crockett" /> Jean has recorded with major hip-hop artists such as [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]], [[The Roots]], [[Phonte]], [[Mr. Len]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[The Herbaliser]], [[Masta Ace]] and [[Immortal Technique]].

It was released on June 24, 2008 on Zune Live Marketplace, then on disc on July 8, 2008. Jean's rapping was described by [[Robert Christgau]] as "remarkable for its rapidity, clarity and idiomatic cadence. The writing has a good-humored polysyllabic literacy."<ref name="Christgau">Christgau, Robert (2008), "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95263555 Jean Grae Shows There's No Better Femcee]", [[NPR Music]]</ref>

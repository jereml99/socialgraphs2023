He has worked on albums by [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Gravediggaz]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[3rd Bass]], among others. Major recognition for Prince Paul came when he produced [[De La Soul]]'s debut album ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'' (1989), in which he pioneered new approaches to [[hip hop production]], mixing and sampling, notably by including [[hip hop skit|comedy sketches]].

His first solo album, ''[[Psychoanalysis: What Is It?]]'', came out in 1997, followed by a second album, ''[[A Prince Among Thieves]]'', in 1999.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life ===
Paul was interested in music from a young age and started collecting vinyl when he was five.<ref name="princebeats" /> According to his mother, he was mature for his age and tended to hang out with older friends.<ref name="princebeats" />

When he was in fifth grade he started DJing, using a makeshift setup of one Lafayette turntable hooked up to another turntable set and using the balance knob as a fader.<ref name="princebeats" /> In 1981, at age 14, Paul performed a DJ set at The Ace Center Amityville that helped him gain recognition.<ref name="princebeats" /> He did a routine with Trouble Funk's "Pump Me Up" which he later described as his "claim to fame."<ref name="princebeats" /> After The Ace Center performance, Paul started doing parties and tapes with Biz Markie while he was in 8th grade.<ref name="princebeats" /> At the same time, Paul's middle school music teacher was Everett Collins, a drummer for [[The Isley Brothers]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://thevinylfactory.com/features/prince-paul-interview/|title=How De La Soul producer Prince Paul continues to rewrite the rules|website=Thevinylfactory.com|date=October 19, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-02}}</ref> Collins later introduced Paul to De La Soul member [[Maseo]].<ref name=":4" />

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
Prince Paul began performing with groups during his teenage years, first joining a group called Soul Brothers with his longtime friend Don Newkirk.<ref name=":4" /> Paul was one of the original members of [[Stetsasonic]]. He joined the group in 1984 after impressing Daddy-O with his routine in the "Brevoit Day Celebration" DJ battle in Brooklyn.<ref name="princebeats" /> Daddy-O was struck by Paul's energy, saying that he performed his routine with Liquid Liquid's song "Cavern", "like he was mad at the turntables".<ref name="princebeats">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Ethan |title=My Name is Prince...And I Make Beats |journal=The Source |date=April 1999 |pages=136–143 |url=http://ethan-brown.com/articles/PrincePaulOralHistory.pdf}}</ref> Paul credits Grandmaster Flash's song "Flash To The Beat" as the reason he purchased his drum machine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@briancoleman/prince-paul-30abaf516be6|title=PRINCE PAUL|last=Coleman|first=Brian|date=2016-05-30|website=Cuepoint|access-date=2017-09-02}}</ref>

Prince Paul produced "The Gas Face" and "Brooklyn-Queens" on [[3rd Bass]]' 1989 debut ''[[The Cactus Album]].'' The original version of "The Gas Face" was recorded on 4-track cassette tape and started out as mistake.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://music.avclub.com/prolific-producer-prince-paul-on-almost-being-fired-de-1798237198|title=Prolific producer Prince Paul on almost being fired, De La Soul classics, and working with his son|last=Thurm|first=Eric|work=A.V.

Paul also worked on [[De La Soul]]'s first three albums, ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'' (1989), ''[[De La Soul Is Dead]]'' (1991), and ''[[Buhloone Mindstate]]'' (1993). ''De La Soul is Dead'' received a five mic album review from ''[[The Source]]''.<ref name="isdeadreview">{{cite journal |title=De La Soul is Dead Album Review |journal=The Source |date=1991 |url=https://ifihavent.wordpress.com/2007/04/20/classic-review-de-la-soul-is-dead-in-the-source-1991/ |access-date=April 12, 2015}}</ref> According to Paul, ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'' (1989) had a budget of about $20,000 dollars and took a month and a half to make.<ref name=princebeats /> In Brian Coleman's 2007 book ''[[Check the Technique]]'', Paul reflected on his work with De La Soul by saying, "If there was ever a sign of the existence of God, De La Soul would be that proof to me. I've never had such a perfect fit in any other production situation."<ref name=technique>{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=Brian |title=Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies |date=June 12, 2007 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-8129-7775-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/checktechniqueli00cole |url-access=registration }}</ref>

In 1990, [[Russell Simmons]] gave Prince Paul an imprint under his [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] label, however the only album, ''It Takes a Nation of Suckers to Let Us In'' by Resident Alien, was never officially released. It is available as an unofficial release, which is different to a bootleg.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.discogs.com/release/14181871-Resident-Alien-It-Takes-A-Nation-Of-Suckas-To-Let-Us-In | title=Resident Alien - It Takes a Nation of Suckas to Let Us in | website=[[Discogs]] | date=January 24, 2022 }}</ref>

Along with [[Frukwan]] of Stetsasonic, [[Anthony Ian Berkeley|Too Poetic]] of [[Brothers Grym|Brothers Grimm]], and the [[RZA]] of [[Wu-Tang Clan]], Prince Paul formed the group [[Gravediggaz]].<ref name="princebeats" /> They recorded a demo together in 1991 and released their first album ''[[Niggamortis]]/[[6 Feet Deep]]'' in 1994 on Gee Street Records.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiphopsite.com/2013/07/25/exclusive-prince-paul-breaks-down-gravediggaz-6-feet-deep-track-by-track/|title=Exclusive: Prince Paul Breaks Down Gravediggaz "6 Feet Deep" Track-By-Track|last=Pattinson|first=Chris|website=HipHopSite.Com|access-date=2017-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902105423/http://www.hiphopsite.com/2013/07/25/exclusive-prince-paul-breaks-down-gravediggaz-6-feet-deep-track-by-track/|archive-date=September 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Before signing a deal with Gee Street, [[Eazy-E]] wanted to release the album on [[Ruthless Records]]. Paul flew to Los Angeles to have a meeting with Eazy-E and Jerry Heller but was unimpressed with the contract and declined. After the group signed to Gee Street, Paul estimated that it took them about six months to complete the album.<ref name=":2" />

Prince Paul also contributed to several other projects during this time period. He produced three songs for [[Boogie Down Productions]]' 1992 album ''[[Sex and Violence (album)|Sex and Violence]]'', though later expressed frustration that the group released the album before he had finalized and polished those tracks.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/12/prince-paul-tells-all-the-stories-behind-his-classic-records-part-2/boogie-down-productions-sex-and-violence-1992|title=Prince Paul Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records (Part 2)Boogie Down Productions "Sex and Violence" (1992)|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-09-02}}</ref> In 1995, Paul and [[Teo Macero]] collaborated to produce the solo debut from guitarist [[Vernon Reid]], and in 1996 he appeared on the compilation album ''[[America Is Dying Slowly]]''.{{cn|date=July 2023}} Additionally, Paul joined forces with Amityville rapper Superstar to launch a supergroup called Horror City. Paul produced a Horror City album, but proved unable to successfully market the album to any record labels.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2010/06/23/download-prince-paul-presents-horror-city|title=Download: Prince Paul Presents Horror City|website=The FADER|access-date=2017-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Horror City|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/76484-Horror-City|access-date=2020-10-06|website=Discogs|language=en}}</ref> Ultimately, Paul decided to ''Horror City'' as a free download in 2010.<ref name=":5" />

In 1996, during the early recording sessions for ''[[Stakes Is High]]'', De La Soul and Prince Paul decided to part ways.<ref name=fromsoul>{{cite web |last1=Sorce-1 |first1=DJ |title=From the Soul: The Music and Influence of De La (Part One) |url=http://uproxx.com/smokingsection/2008/08/from-the-soul-the-music-and-influence-of-de-la-part-one/ |website=The Smoking Section |access-date=April 12, 2015}}</ref>  Although Paul was not involved in the making of the album, he has praised it in several interviews, once saying, "I was going through a serious transition period in my life when that album dropped. I was trying to figure out the next thing I was going to do; I was going through a custody case for my son, and I was running out of money. There were a lot of things going on at the time and in a sense, that album pulled me through everything."<ref name=fromsoul />

After splitting from De La Soul, Paul released two solo albums in the following years: ''[[Psychoanalysis: What Is It?]]'' (1996) and ''[[A Prince Among Thieves]]'' (1999). These albums featured a wide range of rappers, including [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Xzibit]], [[Kool Keith]], and [[Everlast (singer)|Everlast]]. When Paul was recording ''Psychoanalysis'' he thought his career was over and had a hard time finding people who wanted to be involved with the project.<ref name=":0" /> Many of the vocals were provided by friends of his from outside the music industry.<ref name=":0" /> Years later he recalled thinking, "Some people might get butt-hurt about it, but so what? It's probably the last record I'll make anyway," during the recording of "Beautiful Night (Manic Psychopath)".<ref name=":0" /> The song is very dark and deals with date rape, racism, and violence.

According to Paul, he originally proposed the idea for ''A Prince Among Thieves'' to Russell Simmons in the early 1990s but Simmons was not interested.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/12/prince-paul-tells-all-the-stories-behind-his-classic-records-part-2/prince-paul-a-prince-among-thieves-1999|title=Prince Paul Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records (Part 2)Prince Paul, A Prince Among Thieves (1999)|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-09-02}}</ref> While describing his goals for the album in an interview he said, "I wanted to make a movie on wax. I wanted to make an adults' kid album."<ref name=":3" /> To prepare for the album he watched many [[B movie]]s and tried to use scenes from various films as inspiration.<ref name=":3" /> On ''A Prince Among Thieves'', Paul also repurposed some of the beats he had initially composed for ''Horror City''.<ref name=":5" /> In addition to the extensive list of rappers on the album, Paul reached out to Vanilla Ice to perform on "Handle Your Time" with [[Sadat X]] and Xzibit.<ref name=":3" /> He also reached out to [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] about playing a role on the album and was supposed to meet up with him the night he was murdered.<ref>The Combat Jack Show {{Citation|title=The Prince Paul Episode|url=https://soundcloud.com/thecombatjackshow/the-prince-paul-episode|language=en|access-date=2017-09-02}}</ref>

Prince Paul formed the duo [[Handsome Boy Modeling School]] with [[Dan the Automator]]. Their 1999 debut album, ''[[So... How's Your Girl?]]'', featured [[Sean Lennon]], [[Del the Funky Homosapien]], [[Alec Empire]], and [[Don Novello]].

=== 21st century ===
Paul contributed to multiple projects in the year 2000. His work from that year includes the song "The Fantabulous Rap Extravaganza" on [[Deltron 3030]]'s [[Deltron 3030 (album)|self-titled album]], as well as ''[[It's Very Stimulating]]'', the debut EP by [[MC Paul Barman]].

Prince Paul's 2003 album ''[[Politics of the Business]]'' again featured many guests such as [[Chuck D]], [[Ice-T]], [[The Beatnuts]], and [[Wordsworth (rapper)|Wordsworth]]. The latter also collaborated on a track Paul composed for ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'' soundtrack.{{cn|date=July 2023}} Paul followed this project with a second Handsome Boy Modeling School album, ''[[White People (album)|White People]]'', in 2004. His next solo album was ''[[Itstrumental]]'' (2005). It encompasses a range of genres, relying heavily on past samples, especially from ''A Prince Among Thieves'', and combining them with lighthearted skits about his [[clinical depression|depression]]. As of 2023, ''Itstrumental'' is Paul's most recent studio album.

Paul continued to collaborate throughout the 2000s. In 2005, he produced the album ''[[The Art of Picking Up Women]]'' by [[the Dix]], which combines some of hip-hop's misogyny and boasting with 1960s-style [[R&B]]. He also collaborated with [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]], [[Don Newkirk]], and [[Talking Heads]] keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]] to release an album titled ''Turn My Teeth Up!'' (2007) under the moniker Baby Elephant. Another project Paul produced during this period was ''[[Montezuma's Revenge (album)|Montezuma's Revenge]]'', a 2009 album by [[Souls of Mischief]]. On this album, Paul extensively used vintage equipment such as the [[E-mu SP-12|Emu SP-12]], [[Ensoniq ASR-10]], [[Music Production Center#MPC60|Akai MPC-60]] and an [[Music Production Center#MPC2000|Akai MPC-2000]].<ref name=speakclout>{{cite web |last1=Sorce-1 |first1=DJ |title=Speak Ya Clout: Prince Paul on Montezuma's Revenege Part 1 |url=http://heavyinthestreets.blogspot.com/2010/07/speak-ya-clout-prince-paul-on.html |website=Heavy in the Streets |date=July 17, 2010 |access-date=11 April 2015}}</ref>

At the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2006, Prince Paul was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] for his work on [[Chris Rock]]'s ''[[Never Scared]]''.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

In 2012, Paul spoke openly in an interview about the possibility of doing another De La Soul album after Maseo had made some public comments about a reunion. In the interview, Paul states that he asked the members of De La Soul to work on a new album on and off since 1999.<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=http://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.1957/title.prince-paul-debunks-rumored-de-la-soul-reunion-looks-ahead-to-negroes-on-ice#|title=Prince Paul Debunks Rumored De La Soul Reunion, Looks Ahead To Negroes On Ice|website=HiphopdX.com|access-date=2017-09-02|language=en-US}}</ref> Though he wanted to do a reunion at one time, it seemed in the interview he had moved past the idea, partially because of the far more restrictive sampling laws that exist today. He said, "It's nice to think about it, but I kind of like where we left it. There would be so many expectations. For me to do another De La record, I don't think I could really live up to it. Especially in a day and age where I can't openly sample like that."<ref name=":6" />

Paul continued to provide occasional contributions to various products in the 2010s and 2020s. In 2016, he collaborated with Brazilian hip hop fusion group Broozkill! on an album titled ''Throwback to the Future''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22478-throwback-to-the-future/|title=BROOKZILL!: Throwback to the Future|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref> In 2017 Prince Paul helped to score ''Mogul'', a [[Gimlet Media]] podcast about hip-hop scene-maker [[Chris Lighty]].{{cn|date=July 2023}} In 2020, Prince Paul co-produced the [[Gorillaz]] song "[[Pac-Man (Gorillaz song)|Pac-Man]]" for the band's [[Song Machine]] web series.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Yoo|first=Noah|date=20 July 2020|title=Gorillaz and ScHoolboy Q Share New Song "PAC-MAN": Listen|work=Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/gorillaz-and-schoolboy-q-share-new-song-pac-man-listen/|access-date=29 October 2020}}</ref>

In 2017, Prince Paul joined the Creators Advisory Board of [[Tracklib]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicconnection.com/zaytoven-joins-tracklib-creators-advisory-board/|title=Grammy-Winning Producer Zaytoven Joins Tracklib Creators Advisory Board|date=2018-10-05|website=Music Connection Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-05}}</ref> In an interview with Tracklib, Prince Paul stated that "I know Tracklib will help (producers) because it will give everybody an opportunity to sample without having to look over their shoulder."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Introducing Tracklib - The Future of Sampling|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A5X5puHfJE |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/6A5X5puHfJE| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|publisher=[[YouTube]]|language=en|access-date=2019-09-05}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

== Equipment ==
Paul has talked about his fondness for vintage equipment in several interviews. One of his favorite pieces of vintage equipment is the [[Akai S900]], which he credits for having a unique sound, saying, "Even though it's big and bulky, nothing sounds like that. It's pretty flexible, it's easy to work, and it's easy to truncate your sample and get things tight...When you look at all this new technology, everything sounds very sterile. Everything is clean and super quiet. It kind of lacks something. When I plug that in, it's like, 'Wow, this is hip hop.'"<ref name="makethose" />

== Record collection ==
He is known for sampling from a wide range of genres.<ref name="princebeats" /> Rapper [[Biz Markie]] once said of Paul's production style, "Prince Paul's contribution to hip-hop is that you could use records that weren't by James Brown or just break-beats."<ref name="princebeats" />

== Style and influences ==
Unlike the vast majority of hip-hop producers during the 1980s and early 1990s, Paul explored many genres outside of funk and soul to extract samples.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prince Paul Dives Deep Into Music History|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/arts/music/prince-paul-spotify-podcast.html}}</ref> 

[[Chris Rock]] listed the ''Buhloone Mindstate'' album at number ten on his "Top 25 Albums" list. He credited the album as helping to shape him as a comedian.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Top 25 Albums {{!}} The Official Chris Rock Site|url=http://www.chrisrock.com/category/top-25-albums|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825090537/http://www.chrisrock.com/category/top-25-albums#|archive-date=August 25, 2017|access-date=2017-09-02|website=Chrisrock.com|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1999, Rock appeared on Paul's ''A Prince Among Thieves.''<ref>{{Citation|title=A Prince Among Thieves - Prince Paul {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-prince-among-thieves-mw0000036796|language=en-us|access-date=2020-10-06}}</ref> Later in 2005, Rock's debut album was produced by Paul.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.stereogum.com/2033158/prince-paul-a-prince-among-thieves-20/reviews/the-anniversary/ | title=Prince Paul's 'A Prince Among Thieves' Turns 20 | date=February 22, 2019 }}</ref>

Paul credits [[The Bomb Squad]] and [[Public Enemy]] as being a significant influence on early De La Soul production, saying, "Early Public Enemy production used layers upon layers and layers, and their arrangements were always super duper incredible to me. We were kind of like students to what they did."<ref name=makethose>{{cite web |last1=Sorce-1 |first1=DJ |title="Make Those Records You Make"- Prince Paul Speaks on De La Soul is Dead |url=http://heavyinthestreets.blogspot.com/2013/03/make-those-records-you-make-prince-paul.html |website=Heavy in the Streets |date=March 18, 2013 |access-date=April 12, 2015}}</ref> In addition to The Bomb Squad, he also lists [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Rick Rubin]], and [[Bernie Worrell]] as his major influences.<ref name=":4" />

While Paul continues to utilize samples, he has expanded his production to include live instrumentation, including guitar, bass guitar, and several analog keyboards.<ref name="speakclout" /> To combine elements of sampling and live instrumentation, Paul now re-plays some of his samples with instruments. In a 2010 interview he described the process by saying, "I’ve gotten to the point now where I’ll re-play samples with instruments. I learned how to interpolate, change the sound, and dust it out so that when I’m re-playing certain samples, it sounds like a direct sample from a record."<ref name="speakclout" />

Paul has credited the process of working with [[Dan the Automator]] on the [[Handsome Boy Modeling School]] project as helping him learn a great deal about production.<ref name="speakclout" />

== Influence ==
Unlike many hip-hop producers of his era, Paul explored many genres outside of funk and soul to extract samples.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prince Paul Dives Deep Into Music History|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/arts/music/prince-paul-spotify-podcast.html}}</ref>

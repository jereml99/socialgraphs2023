==Career==
===Early work===
A roommate of Wu-Tang founder [[RZA]], Ghostface helped bring together the other seven members. In 1995, Ghostface guest-starred extensively on fellow Clan member [[Raekwon]]'s debut album, ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'', appearing on almost every song and receiving nearly equal billing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Only-Built-4-Cuban-Linx/dp/B000002WU9 |title=Only Built 4 Cuban Linx: Raekwon: Music |website=Amazon |access-date=July 22, 2013}}</ref> "It felt good to have my boy next to me, Ghostface, who basically comes from the same lifestyle as I come from. And we were able to sit down and concoct an idea that we both were able to respect and basically get everybody in the crew involved...", said Raekwon about Ghostface's involvement in the project. Raekwon intended ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' to play like a film, with himself as the "star," Ghostface Killah as the "guest star" and producer RZA as the "director."<ref>{{cite web|url= https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.57118/title.raekwon-announces-only-built-for-cuban-linx-3-album-as-original-turns-25|title=Raekwon Announces 'Only Built For Cuban Linx 3' Album As Original Turns 25|date=August 1, 2020}}</ref> He also contributed songs to the ''[[Sunset Park (film)|Sunset Park]]'' and ''[[Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood]]'' soundtracks; both songs were included on his first solo LP, ''[[Ironman (Ghostface Killah album)|Ironman]]'', in 1996. The album, which debuted at #2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], had a more pronounced [[soul music|soul]] influence (particularly 1970s soul) than previous Wu-Tang releases, and Ghostface's future albums would continue to feature this stylistic trait.<ref>{{cite web|author=Artist Biography by Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ghostface-killah-mn0000655746/awards |title=Ghostface Killah &#124; Awards |website=AllMusic |date=May 9, 1970 |access-date=July 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mymusic.com/product.asp?curr=0&myptr=ottawastart&muzenbr=215566] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718210500/http://www.mymusic.com/product.asp?curr=0&myptr=ottawastart&muzenbr=215566|date=July 18, 2011}}</ref>

In the year 2000, Ghostface released his second studio album, ''[[Supreme Clientele]]''. The album was well received by critics, and peaked at #7 on the Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Ghostface killah|chart=all}} |title=Ghostface Killah - Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 22, 2013}}</ref> It included "[[Apollo Kids (Ghostface Killah single)|Apollo Kids]]", a popular single which featured Raekwon and had a sample of "Cool Breeze" by [[Solomon Burke]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1999-12-11/r-b-hip-hop-songs |title=Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs : Dec 11, 1999 &#124; Billboard Chart Archive |magazine=Billboard.com |date=December 11, 1999 |access-date=July 22, 2013}}</ref> "[[Cherchez La Ghost]]", another single off the album, became a minor club hit.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2001-03-03/rap-song |title=Rap Songs : Mar 03, 2001 &#124; Billboard Chart Archive |magazine=Billboard.com |date=March 3, 2001 |access-date=July 22, 2013}}</ref> ''Supreme Clientele'' marked a turning point in terms of RZA's influence on Ghostface's sound, as only six songs on it are produced by RZA, whereas on ''Ironman'', its predecessor, every song but one is produced by RZA. Although he contributed fewer beats to the project than to ''Ironman'', RZA personally oversaw the mixing and production of the album as a whole, thereby contributing to ''Supreme Clientele''{{'}}s unified sound.<ref>Bonanno, Jonathan. Return of the Dragan. The Source. March 2000. P:208. Retrieved March 8, 2012.</ref>

Ghostface wasted little time in recording his next album, the heavily [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-influenced ''[[Bulletproof Wallets]]'', released a year after ''Supreme Clientele''. Its main single, "[[Never Be the Same Again (Ghostface Killah song)|Never Be the Same Again]]", featured Raekwon and [[Carl Thomas (singer)|Carl Thomas]]. It produced another minor club hit, "Flowers", which featured guest vocals from fellow Wu-Tang members [[Method Man]] and Raekwon, and a popular single, "[[Ghost Showers]]" which featured Madame Majestic, whose other key claim to fame is that she sings on the popular Wu-Tang track "[[Gravel Pit]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=John Bush |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bulletproof-wallets-mw0000015772 |title=Bulletproof Wallets - Ghostface Killah &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |date=November 13, 2001 |access-date=July 22, 2013}}</ref>

===Def Jam===
In 2003, Ghostface signed with [[Def Jam Records]]. After temporarily dropping "Killah" from his stage name, Ghostface released ''[[The Pretty Toney Album]]'' in April 2004. The album, while containing two RZA productions, featured none of the Clan; instead, it featured collaborations with [[Missy Elliott]], [[The Lox|D-Block]], and [[Jacki-O]]. The singles "[[Tush (Ghostface Killah song)|Tush]]" and "Run", which were collaborations with Missy and [[Jadakiss]] respectively, achieved moderate success in the clubs and on the charts, and the album was featured on numerous "best of the year" lists; for instance, it was Pitchfork Media's #9 album of the year.<ref>[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/38230-staff-list-top-50-albums-of-2004/page_5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611184028/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/38230-staff-list-top-50-albums-of-2004/page_5|date=June 11, 2007}}</ref> Ghostface also appeared on the track "On My Knees" by [[United Kingdom|UK]] R&B group [[the 411]]; the song became a hit in the UK and [[Australia]]. Ghostface then released an album entitled ''[[718 (album)|718]]'' (after the Staten Island [[area code]]) with a group of his protégés, the [[Theodore Unit]]. Ghostface also appeared on "He Comes" by De La Soul, on ''[[The Grind Date]]''. In November 2005, Ghostface and Theodore Unit's breakout star [[Trife Da God]] released a joint project, ''[[Put It on the Line]]''.

In 2006, Ghostface teamed up with underground artist [[MF Doom]] for a still-unreleased album entitled ''[[Swift & Changeable]]''. MF Doom also produced several songs for Ghostface's 2006 album ''[[Fishscale]]'', on which he chose to revert to the stage name "Ghostface Killah", rather than just "Ghostface". The album debuted strongly, appearing at the #4 position on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 and at #2 on the R&B charts,<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=ghostface killah|chart=all}} Ghostface Killah Billboard chart history]</ref> the rapper's most auspicious chart showing since the heyday of the Wu-Tang Clan and the release of his solo debut. The album also received near-unanimous positive reviews. Ghostface embarked on a limited-date tour of U.S. venues in support of the album, performing several of his concerts together with most of the other members of the Wu-Tang Clan.

In 2007, Ghostface provided the theme song for the Irish animated series ''[[Skunk Fu!]]'' that ran on ''[[Kids' WB]]''. On December 4, 2007, Ghostface released his seventh solo studio album, ''[[The Big Doe Rehab]]''.

In a May 2008 interview, Ghostface Killah stated that he would make an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-inspired album in the vein of certain tracks he had done before with artists such as [[Ne-Yo]] and [[Jodeci]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nahright.com/news/2008/08/05/angela-yee-speaks-to-ghostface-raekwon/#more-6652 |title=Angela Yee Speaks To Ghostface & Raekwon |publisher=Nah Right |date=August 5, 2008 |access-date=August 19, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zshare.net/audio/16564278512b2daf/ |title=ghostface killah speaks on rb album.mp3 |publisher=zSHARE |date=August 6, 2009 |access-date=August 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930154519/http://www.zshare.net/audio/16564278512b2daf/ |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> That album would become his eighth studio album, ''[[Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City]]'', which won good reviews from music critics. It featured singles such as "Baby" and "Do Over". In March 2009, Ghostface responded to the [[Rihanna]]/[[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]] controversy by recording a song, "Message from Ghostface", which was dedicated to women in abusive relationships.

In a May 2009 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', Raekwon indicated that Ghostface Killah was preparing to release a new album. In response to a question asking if the Wu-Tang Clan were going to release a follow-up to ''[[8 Diagrams]]'', Raekwon stated, "''Everybody's doing different things right now — you got Meth [Method Man] coming out with [[Blackout! 2|an album]], you got Ghostface coming out with an album, some guys working on their projects, some guys getting into the film world, everybody is multi-tasking right now.''"<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/14/raekwon-talks-cuban-linx-ii-return-of-the-wu-tang-clan/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923235923/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/14/raekwon-talks-cuban-linx-ii-return-of-the-wu-tang-clan/|date=September 23, 2009}}</ref> Ghostface appeared on a total of 8 songs on Raekwon's highly anticipated release of ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II]]''.

Shortly after the release of ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II'', Def Jam contracted Raekwon to work with their label artists Method Man and Ghostface Killah on an album which later received the title ''[[Wu-Massacre]]''. Production began in November 2009. ''Wu-Massacre'' was released March 30, 2010 to generally positive reviews from music critics; this time, however, reviews were more mixed, with some critics objecting to the 30-minute-long album's rushed feel. With heavy promotion, it sold 37,900 units in its first week; it has sold 64,000 units as of May 12, 2010. It features production from [[Scram Jones]], Mathematics, and The RZA, who produced the album's lead single, "Our Dreams". 

In 2010, Ghostface confirmed that he would be releasing two new studio albums, ''[[Apollo Kids (Ghostface Killah album)|Apollo Kids]]'' and one which would serve as a sequel to his 2000 album ''Supreme Clientele''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hughes |first=Josiah |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=148&csid2=844&fid1=50300 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711084629/http://exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=148&csid2=844&fid1=50300 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 11, 2012 |title=Ghostface Killah Announces The Apollo Kids for December 14, Lines Up Two More New Albums • News • |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=October 12, 2010 |access-date=March 30, 2012 }}</ref> In 2011, Ghostface Killah featured on UK artist [[Josh Osho]]'s debut single "Redemption Days".

In July 2011, Coles was sued by [[Jacques Urbont|Jack Urbont]] for copyright violation stemming from the "improper use" of the 1960s "[[Iron Man in other media|Iron Man]]" theme song, which Urbont claimed as his own.

==Aliases==
{{redirect|Tony Starks|the comic book character|Tony Stark}}
Ghostface Killah, like most members of the Wu-Tang clan, rapped under several personae, each with their own name, mythology and influences. Some recurring aliases:

:*'''Ghostface Killah''' (occasionally spelled '''Ghostface Killer''', '''Ghost Face Killer''', '''Ghost Face Killah''', or abbreviated '''GFK''')
:*'''Ghostface''' (shortened stage name during ''[[The Pretty Toney Album]]'' era)<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r688203|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic review of The Pretty Toney Album]: "The Pretty Toney Album [is] the rapper's first under the just-Ghostface moniker"</ref><ref>[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/48535] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522004741/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/48535|date=May 22, 2006}}</ref>
:*'''Ghost Deini'''

His song, "Slept On Tony With Dirt," appears in the 2008 film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', and he also appears in a deleted scene on the DVD.<ref>Introduction of Tony Starks in the song "Wu-Gambinos": the fifth verse is performed by Ghostface Killer, a.k.a.

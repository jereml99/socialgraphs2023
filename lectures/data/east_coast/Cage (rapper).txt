== Early life ==
Chris Palko was born in [[Würzburg]], [[West Germany]], to American parents. His father was stationed on a West German [[military base]] as a member of the [[military police]].<ref name="Bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.definitivejux.net/jukies/cage|title=Biography of Cage |access-date=September 9, 2008 |publisher=[[Definitive Jux]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912084505/http://www.definitivejux.net/jukies/cage |archive-date=September 12, 2008}}</ref>  Palko lived there until the age of four when his father was dishonorably discharged for selling and using heroin, and the family was sent back to the United States, where they lived in [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown, New York]]. His father would often force Palko to pull homemade [[tourniquets]] around his arm as he injected heroin. At the age of eight, Palko's father was arrested during a standoff with state troopers after threatening his family with a shotgun.<ref name="Goldberg">{{cite web |first=Michael Alan |last=Goldberg |title=Cage: Plenty to rap about |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/177858 |website=[[Phoenix New Times]] |date=November 24, 2005 |access-date=September 9, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322045724/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/177858/ |archive-date=March 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Jeffries">{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=David|title=Biography of Cage|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/cage-mn0000536470/biography|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227195339/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cage-mn0000536470/biography|archive-date=February 27, 2015|access-date=September 9, 2008|website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> By the time Palko was expelled from high school, his mother had remarried twice, and he was beaten by his stepfather Frank. Palko began using [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[cocaine]], [[LSD]], [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].<ref name="Jeffries" />

Palko was arrested several times for drug possession and fighting in the streets. Facing jail time for violating probation, his mother convinced the judge he was mentally unstable, and was sent to the Stony Lodge psychiatric hospital for a two-week evaluation. He stayed in the hospital for sixteen months, where he was a part of a small group used to test [[fluoxetine]], commonly known as Prozac.<ref name="Jeffries" /><ref name="IGN">{{cite web |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/424/424016p1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030707112449/http://music.ign.com/articles/424/424016p1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 7, 2003 |title=Rage In The Cage |access-date=September 9, 2008 |author=Spence D. |date=June 13, 2003 |website=IGN }}</ref> After being misdiagnosed and placed on the drug, he became suicidal and made several attempts to kill himself, including hanging himself with his shoelaces and saving his [[lithium (medication)|lithium]] dose for a month before ingesting all of them at once.<ref name="Goldberg" /><ref name="Jeffries" />

== Career ==

=== 1991–2001: Career beginnings ===
When Palko was released from the hospital at eighteen, he pursued a career as a rapper, giving himself the stage name "Alex", after the protagonist of [[Anthony Burgess]]' novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.<ref name="Bio" /> After hiring a manager and recording a demo, he was introduced to rapper [[Pete Nice]], and Cage debuted on the track "Rich, Bring 'Em Back" on the 1993 album ''[[Dust to Dust (Pete Nice and DJ Richie Rich album)|Dust to Dust]]''.<ref name="IGN"/> Known as "Keige" and part of a group named Bloody Ruffnecks and later Mudbones, his first demo mixtape was released in 1994; in the liner notes, he named his influences as [[Kool Keith]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Rakim (rapper)|Rakim]], [[Juice Crew]], [[Marley Marl]] and [[KRS-One]].<ref name=keige>{{cite news |title=Das erste Cage Demo-Tape: Mudbones – Mudbones Madness (1992–1994) |url=https://90erhiphop.de/2014/das-erste-cage-demo-tape-mudbones-mudbones-madness-1992-1994/ |access-date=March 30, 2021 |work=90er Hip Hop |date=July 15, 2014|language=German}}</ref>

Pete Nice also introduced Palko to radio personality [[Bobbito García]], who featured Palko on his program several times, increasing his reputation among New York's [[underground hip hop]] scene, where he became associated with [[KMD]], [[Kurious Jorge]], [[K-Solo]], [[Godfather Don]], [[Necro (rapper)|Necro]], [[Artifacts (group)|Artifacts]], [[Pharoahe Monch]] and [[El-P]]. He spent the last night with [[MF Doom]]'s brother and [[KMD]] member [[DJ Subroc|Subroc]] in 1993 before he was killed in a road accident.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Herbert |first1=Conor |title=Shadows of Tomorrow III: Long Live Kingilizwe |url=https://centralsauce.com/shadows-of-tomorrow-iii-long-live-kingilizwe |access-date=March 30, 2021 |work=Central Sauce |date=January 9, 2021}}</ref> Palko signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]], but frequently recorded while intoxicated, and the label found his efforts to be unsatisfactory.<ref name="Goldberg" /> Palko briefly put his career on hold and his drug use increased.<ref name="Jeffries" /> He became a father to a daughter in 1994.<ref name=spin />

When García founded the label [[Fondle 'Em Records]], he offered Palko a record deal, and Cage released a single featuring the songs "Radiohead" and "Agent Orange" in 1997, to success and acclaim.<ref name="Bio" /> Following the release of ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' in December 1997, Palko accused Detroit-based rapper [[Eminem]] of imitating his style.<ref>{{cite news |first=Neil |last=Drumming |title=Smut Peddlers: Split-Level Raunch |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-417506.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 14, 2001 |access-date=September 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812052334/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-417506.html |archive-date=August 12, 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11923595_ITM |first=Matt |last=Dearborn |author2=Duke |title=Interview: His name is not Slim Shady |publisher=University Wire |date=December 1, 2005 |access-date=September 9, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918021355/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11923595_ITM |archive-date=September 18, 2008 }}</ref>

After several more singles with Fondle 'Em, Palko met Mr. Eon and DJ Mighty Mi of [[The High & Mighty]], and the trio formed the group Smut Peddlers, releasing the album ''[[Porn Again]]'' on [[Rawkus Records]] in 2001. The album peaked at #10 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers [[Billboard charts|chart]], #43 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #184 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], while its single "That Smut" peaked at #9 on the [[Hot Rap Singles]] chart and #96 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r519196|pure_url=yes}} |title=Charts and awards for ''Porn Again'' |access-date=September 9, 2008 |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> In 2001 and 2002 respectively, Palko's music was featured on the soundtrack to the psychological crime film ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'' and season 1 of the crime drama television show ''[[The Wire]]''.

=== 2002–2009: Eastern Conference and Definitive Jux era ===
Palko signed with The High & Mighty's [[Eastern Conference Records]], releasing his debut album, ''[[Movies for the Blind]]'', on August 6, 2002. It peaked at #12 on the Heatseekers chart, #14 on the Top Independent Albums chart, #58 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #193 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r601140|pure_url=yes}} |title=Charts and awards for ''Movies for the Blind'' |access-date=September 9, 2008 |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Palko later stated, in 2006, that the album "sort of glorified drugs" and that he felt the album was "crazy for the sake of being crazy [...] .<ref name="Morris">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/cage-060203.shtml |title=To Hell and Back: An Interview with Cage |access-date=June 27, 2008 |last=Morris |first=David |date=February 6, 2006 |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605000638/http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/cage-060203.shtml |archive-date=June 5, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> During this period, Palko formed the group [[The Weathermen (hip hop group)|The Weathermen]], named after the [[Weatherman (organization)|left-wing political organization]].<ref name="IGN" /> The group released their debut album ''The Conspiracy'' on June 3, 2003, before Palko left Eastern Conference over alleged non-payment.<ref name="Jeffries" /> An [[extended play]], titled ''[[Weatherproof]]'', was released on July 29, 2003. During his time on Eastern Conference, [[Interscope Records]] showed interest in signing Cage despite Eminem also being on their label, but ended their interest after judging that he would not attract a mainstream audience.<ref name=spin>{{cite news |last1=Golianopoulos |first1=Thomas |title=Out of the Shadows |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGaz0_gZPzIC&q=spin+magazine+2009+cage&pg=PA60 |access-date=June 21, 2018 |work=Spin |date=August 2009 |pages=60–64 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621043101/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xGaz0_gZPzIC&pg=PA60#v=onepage&q=spin%20magazine%202009%20cage |archive-date=June 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Because Palko felt that he should no longer play a character, he began to take on a more open writing style,<ref name="Jeffries" /> and signed with [[Definitive Jux]], where he released his second studio album ''[[Hell's Winter]]'', on September 20, 2005. ''Hell's Winter'' peaked at #26 on the Top Heatseekers chart and at #36 on the Top Independent Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r795458|pure_url=yes}} |title=Charts and awards for ''Hell's Winter'' |access-date=September 9, 2008 |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>

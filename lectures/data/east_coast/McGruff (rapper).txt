==Career==
Brown started rapping in his early teens. He embarked on his music career in the hip hop group Bronx Most Wanted, alongside rappers Jay Q and Tee U.B. Brown later became a member of the hip hop collective [[Children of the Corn (group)|Children of the Corn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oneleguprecords.blogspot.ca/2008/04/herb-mcgruff-interview.html|title=HERB MCGRUFF: INTERVIEW!|website=oneleguprecords.blogspot.ca|date=April 11, 2008|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}</ref> As a member of Children of the Corn, Brown worked alongside [[Big L]], [[Cam'ron]], Bloodshed and [[Mase]], all of whom would go on to have successful careers in the music industry.<ref>[http://mikebschoolofhiphop.blogspot.ca/2012/02/blog-birth-briefly-brief-bio-of-herb.html] {{dead link|date=May 2023}}</ref> After the group disbanded without releasing any material, Brown made his first appearance on Big L's debut album, ''[[Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous]]'' (1995), on the tracks "8 Iz Enuff" and "Danger Zone". Eventually, Brown signed a deal with popular hip hop label, [[Uptown Records]] and began recording his debut album, ''[[Destined to Be]]''. In early 1998, the album's lead single "Before We Start" became a minor hit, charting on several ''Billboard'' charts. In the Summer of 1998, ''Destined to Be'' was released but failed to sell many copies, only peaking at 169 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and Brown was released from his contract. Brown would make appearances with [[Heavy D]] on his album, ''[[Waterbed Hev]]'' and the [[Woo (soundtrack)|''Woo'' soundtrack]]. 

McGruff contributed guest vocals on the song ''Stop Calling'' on [[Cam'ron]]'s Platinum-RIAA certified album, ''[[Come Home With Me]]'', which sold over a million copies in America.

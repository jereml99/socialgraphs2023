James and her daughter are referenced in Tupac's song "Keep Ya Head Up". In an interview James stated she considers herself a feminist "in a way", emphasizing the need for women to avoid complete emotional and financial dependence on men. Songs like "Tramp" and "[[Shake Your Thang]]" by Salt-N-Pepa express such feminist themes as female autonomy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Tricia|title=Never Trust A Big Butt and a Smile|journal=Camera Obscura|date=May 1990|volume=8|issue=2|pages=108–131|doi=10.1215/02705346-8-2_23-108|url=http://cameraobscura.dukejournals.org/content/8/2_23/108.full.pdf|access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref> She was baptized into the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] on a mission trip in [[Ethiopia]] with [[Oakwood University|Oakwood College]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Let's Talk About God, Baby|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/marchweb-only/110-24.0.html|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|first=Rebecca|last=Cusey|newspaper=Christianitytoday.com |date=March 4, 2008|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHWP3GjZMqU |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/pHWP3GjZMqU |archive-date=December 21, 2021 |url-status=live|title=Ethiopia Mission 2001|website=YouTube|access-date=May 8, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

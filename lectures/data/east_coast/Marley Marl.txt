'''Marlon Lu'Ree Williams''' (born September 30, 1962), better known by his stage name '''Marley Marl''', is an American DJ, record producer, rapper and record label founder, primarily operating in [[hip hop music]].<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=211}}</ref> Marlon grew up in [[Queensbridge Houses|Queensbridge]] housing projects<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mao|first=Jeff Chairman|date=2014|title=Marley Marl Lecture|url=https://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/marley-marl-tokyo-2014|access-date=August 10, 2020|website=Red Bull Music Academy}}</ref> located in [[Queens]], New York. He performed in local talent shows during the early days of rap music, further fueling his interest.

He was also featured on [[Eric B. & Rakim]]'s "[[Paid in Full (Eric B. & Rakim song)|Paid in Full]]" from their [[Paid in Full (album)|debut album]], which was also recorded in his studio.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mao|first=Jeff Chairman|date=December 1997|title=The Microphone God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry0EAAAAMBAJ&q=marley+marl+vibe&pg=PA134|journal=Vibe|pages=134|via=Google Books}}</ref> 
He is credited with influencing a number of hip hop icons such as [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]], [[RZA]], [[DJ Premier]], [[Madlib]], and [[Pete Rock]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p101803/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography], [[AllMusic]]</ref> Producer Madlib stated in an interview that Marley was the first producer who inspired him to make beats.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Torres|first=Andre|date=November 19, 2013|title=Madlib revived the crate-digging tradition before flipping the script and embracing live playing|url=https://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/astral-traveler/|journal=Wax Poetics}}</ref> ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' magazine wrote that he, "forever changed the sound of hip-hop with his unique beat barrages."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mao|first=Jeff Chairman|date=September 1998|title=Props: The Juice Crew|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lywEAAAAMBAJ&q=marley+marl&pg=PA312|journal=Vibe|pages=312|via=Google Books}}</ref>

== Early career ==
Marley's career started with an interest in [[electronica]].<ref name=":0" /> As a young intern at [[Unique Recording Studios]] in the early 1980s, he had an opportunity to experiment with very expensive samplers like the [[Fairlight CMI]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last1=Muhammad|first1=Ali Shaheed|last2=Kelley|first2=Frannie|date=September 12, 2013|title=Microphone Check: Marley Marl On The Bridge Wars, LL Cool J And Discovering Sampling|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/microphonecheck/2013/09/11/221440934/marley-marl-on-the-bridge-wars-ll-cool-j-and-discovering-sampling|access-date=August 10, 2020|website=NPR}}</ref> One day during a studio session with an artist named Captain Rock he discovered sampling by accident. <blockquote>"I was actually trying to get a riff off of a record. I made a mistake and got the snare in there before the sound came. I was truncating the vocal part but the snare was playing with the beat — we was truncating while the beat was playing. Thank God the beat was playing, because it probably wouldn't have happened if the beat wasn't playing. So I was playing it and the snare sounded better than the snare that I had from the drum machine when I was popping it."<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>A short time later pioneering hip-hop radio DJ [[Mr. Magic]] heard Marley Marl's remix of [[Malcolm McLaren]]'s [[Buffalo Gals (Malcolm McLaren song)|Buffalo Gals]], leading to Marley becoming his DJ.<ref name=":0" /> They eventually started the hip-hop collective the [[Juice Crew]] together in 1983. 1986 saw the foundation of [[Cold Chillin' Records]], where Marley served as in-house producer for many projects. He earned $250,000 per year for his production work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kondo|first=Toshitaka|date=May 2005|title=Karma: Marley Marl's Juice Crew ran rap in the '80s, but nothing lasts forever|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCcEAAAAMBAJ&q=marley+marl&pg=PA56|journal=Vibe|pages=56|via=Google Books}}</ref> The label was also home to many Juice Crew artists.

Marley caught his big break in 1984, with artist [[Roxanne Shante]]'s hit "[[Roxanne's Revenge]]". In a 2008 interview Shante noted how seriously he took recording despite his limited setup. "We'd be recording in his living room on a reel-to-reel and four-tracks. I really just wanted to go to the mall after one take, but Marley always made me do it again."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gonzales|first=Michael A.|date=2008|title=Crew Deep: Marley Marl Forms the Indomitable Juice Crew|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyYEAAAAMBAJ&q=marley+marl&pg=PA88|journal=Vibe|pages=88|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Another significant early record was 1985's "Marley Marl Scratch" featuring MC Shan. The song was recorded on a four-track cassette recorder and Shan used a mic with a missing ball to record his lyrics.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Merlis|first=Ben|title=Goin' Off: The Story of the Juice Crew & Cold Chillin' Records (RPM Series Book 3)|publisher=BMG Books|year=2019|isbn=978-1-947026-32-2}}</ref>

Several of his early record feature inventive use of the [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine. On [[MC Shan]]'s 1986 Pop Art single "The Bridge', which later appeared on his 1987 album ''[[Down by Law (MC Shan album)|Down By Law]]'', Marley used the 808 pulse to trigger different samplers.<ref name=":0" /> According to Biz Markie, the button on Marley's 808 stuck during the recording of his hit "Make the Music with Your Mouth, Biz", leading to sound heard on the record today.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Coleman|first=Brian|title=Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies|publisher=Villard|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8129-7775-2|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref> Juice Crew member [[Big Daddy Kane]] praised his ability to pair 808 drum sounds with sampled drums. "Regardless of how clean or brand-new the record was that he was sampling, or light the production may have been, he always gave it a really gritty feel when he sampled it. He always put the 808 to it and gave it a heavy bottom and warm feel."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Coleman|first=Brian|title=Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies|publisher=Villard|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8129-7775-2|location=New York|pages=38}}</ref>

In the late 1980s, the Juice Crew gained increased attention from mainstream publications. [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'' magazine]] wrote, "they've produced some of the genre's toughest, most uncompromising music."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leland|first=John|date=December 1988|title=Singles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5oyYjDeNc_AC&q=marley+marl+spin&pg=PA112|journal=Spin|pages=112|via=Google Books}}</ref> At the time Marley began a streak of producing entire albums for several Juice Crew members. He produced all of the tracks on [[Craig G]]'s ''[[The Kingpin (album)|The Kingpin]]'' (1989), [[Big Daddy Kane]]'s ''[[Long Live the Kane|Long Live The Kane]]'' (1988)'','' [[Biz Markie]]'s ''[[Goin' Off]]'' (1988), [[Kool G Rap]] & DJ Polo's ''[[Road to the Riches]]'' (1989), [[MC Shan]]'s [[Down by Law (MC Shan album)|''Down By Law'']] (1987) and ''[[Born to Be Wild (MC Shan album)|Born to Be Wild]]'' (1988), and [[Roxanne Shante]]'s ''[[Bad Sister (album)|Bad Sister]]'' [[Bad Sister (album)|(1989)]].

In 1988, he produced the Juice Crew posse cut "The Symphony" by using a [[Hal Jackson]] record from the [[WBLS]] record library as a sample source.<ref name=":0" />

== Post-Juice Crew and Cold Chillin' ==
In 1996, Marley filed a suit against Cold Chillin' for unpaid royalties.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Coleman|first=Monyca D.|date=November 9, 1996|title=Gossip|work=Indianapolis Recorder|url=https://newspapers.library.in.gov/?a=d&d=INR19961109-01.1.10&srpos=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-marley+marl------|access-date=August 11, 2020}}</ref>

In 2007 he produced the entire ''[[Hip Hop Lives]]'' album for former rival [[KRS-One]].

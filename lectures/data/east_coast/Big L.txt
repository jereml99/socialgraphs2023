'''Lamont Coleman''' (May 30, 1974{{spaced ndash}}February 15, 1999), known professionally as '''Big L''', was an American rapper.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Today in hip hop history: Big L was shot and killed 22 years ago|url=https://thesource.com/2021/02/15/today-in-hip-hop-history-big-l-was-shot-and-killed-in-harlem-22-years-ago/|access-date=June 17, 2021|website=The Source|date=February 15, 2021}}</ref>

Emerging from [[Harlem]] in New York City in 1992, Coleman became known among [[underground hip-hop]] fans for his freestyling ability. He was eventually signed to [[Columbia Records]], where, in 1995, he released his debut album, ''[[Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous]]''. On February 15, 1999, Coleman was shot nine times in his East Harlem neighborhood and later succumbed to his injuries.

However, he said he preferred other styles over horrorcore.<ref name="1995 Source Interview" />

In 2017, Lou Black, Gerard Woodley's cousin, published ''Ethylene: The Rise and Fall of The 139th St. NFL Crew''. The book details Black's first hand interactions with the NFL crew and Big L. In the book, Black claims Leroy "Big Lee" Phinazee, Coleman's eldest half-brother and leader of the NFL crew, violated his probation when he was found to be in possession of an illegal weapon and was sentenced to prison. According to Black, while in prison, Phinazee met and contracted a hitman from [[Brooklyn]] to murder three members of the NFL gang including Woodley. Phinazee had tasked Big L to identify the targets to the hitman. On the day when the murder was planned, Woodley noticed the hitman following him and successfully scared him off. As Big L had been seen multiple times with the alleged hitman days prior, Woodley assumed Big L had taken part in the attempted shooting. Approximately a week after the attempted shooting of Woodley, Big L was killed. Black did not specify if Woodley personally killed Big L.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Lou|title=Ethylene: The Rise and Fall of The 139th St. NFL Crew|date=June 19, 2017|publisher=Respect the Pen LLC|isbn=978-0-9989986-0-2|edition=1st|pages=147–152}}</ref>

Coleman is often credited in helping to create the [[horrorcore]] genre of hip hop with his 1992 song "Devil's Son."<ref name="1995 Source Interview" /> However, not all his songs fall into this genre. For example, in the song "Street Struck," Coleman discusses the difficulties of growing up in the ghetto and describes the consequences of living a life of crime.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} Idris Goodwin of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote that "[Big L had an] impressive command of the English language", with his song "Ebonics" being the best example of this.<ref name="globe">{{Cite news | last=Goodwin | first=Idris | date=December 7, 2010 | url=http://articles.boston.com/2010-12-07/ae/29307215_1_rap-critics-jay-z-norton-anthology | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130118131443/http://articles.boston.com/2010-12-07/ae/29307215_1_rap-critics-jay-z-norton-anthology | url-status=dead | archive-date=January 18, 2013 | title=Anthology Expands Rap from Music to Literature | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | publisher=[[New York Times Company]] | access-date=February 9, 2012 }}</ref>

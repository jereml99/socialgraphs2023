'''James Campbell''' (born March 27, 1969), better known by his [[stage name]]s '''Freddie Foxxx''' and '''Bumpy Knuckles''', is an American [[Rapping|rapper]] and [[Record producer|music producer]] from [[Long Island|Long Island, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Freddie-Foxxx-Biography/F64618AB2C53EF5A48256A2400108CC6 |title=Freddie Foxxx Biography |publisher=Sing365.com |date=2011-05-30 |access-date=2015-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110954/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Freddie-Foxxx-Biography/F64618AB2C53EF5A48256A2400108CC6 |archive-date=2015-04-02 }}</ref>

==Biography==
Foxxx got his start rapping in the early 1980s.

In 1986, he recorded "You Gotta Come Out Fresh / Handling Things" under the alias Freddie C. as a member of the [[Supreme Force]] (other members were [[Cool Cee]] and [[Easy E]]) on [[NIA Records]]. Later in 1986 he was slated to meet with producer [[Eric B.]] who was searching for an MC to pair up with; Foxxx missed the meeting, and Eric B. ended up pairing up with MC [[Rakim]] and forming the group [[Eric B. and Rakim]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Despite this, Foxxx's first [[album|LP]], ''[[Freddie Foxxx Is Here]]'', was produced entirely by Eric B. and Foxxx, and was released in 1989 through [[MCA Records]]. He soon parted ways with the label and became a member of [[Queen Latifah]]'s [[Flavor Unit]] establishment.<ref name=ALLMUSIC>{{cite web|author=Andy Kellman |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/freddie-foxxx-mn0000181390/biography |title=Freddie Foxxx &#124; Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2015-05-22}}</ref> In 1993, only promo copies of his second album, ''[[Crazy Like A Foxxx]]'', were circulated when [[Epic Records]] decided to shelve it.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Foxxx then began to be known more for his cameos on songs by [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Naughty by Nature]], [[M.O.P.]], [[O.C. (rapper)|O.C.]] and, most notably, his appearance on [[Gang Starr]]'s ''[[The Militia]]'' from their ''[[Moment of Truth (Gang Starr album)|Moment of Truth]]'' album (1998). The song was issued as a [[Single (music)|single]], building a buzz for Foxxx and helping him to prep for his next full-length release.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

This time around he applied the lessons he'd learned from previous experiences with major record labels, and went the [[Independent record label|independent]] route. The ''[[Industry Shakedown]]'' album featured production from hip hop heavyweights [[DJ Premier]], [[Pete Rock]] and [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]]. The members of M.O.P. provided the album's only cameo.

After the success of ''[[Industry Shakedown]]'', Foxxx released his fourth album, ''[[The Konexion]]'' (2003) via [[Barely Breaking Even]]. A less commercially successful affair, the album was nevertheless faithful to its predecessor in terms of style and content and featured contributions from frequent collaborator [[DJ Premier]] and [[Clark Kent (producer)|DJ Clark Kent]].

Foxxx made significant contributions to the [[WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006]] soundtrack. He contributed two songs, and made a guest appearance on another song. He also produced all of the hip hop songs. He also appeared on [[John Cena]]'s [[WWE Music|WWE released]] album ''[[You Can't See Me]]''.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

In 2006, Foxxx released his fifth album, ''[[Street Triumph]]''.
In 2009, Foxxx released his sixth album, ''[[Amerikkan Black Man]]''.

Bumpy Knucklesâ€™ previously shelved second album ''[[Crazy Like a Foxxx]]'' finally saw a major official release on July 29, 2008 on Fat Beats Records.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

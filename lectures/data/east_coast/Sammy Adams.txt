'''Samuel Adams Wisner''' (born August 14, 1987) is an American rapper, singer and songwriter.

==Early years==
Sammy Adams was born as Samuel Adams Wisner on August 14, 1987, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to Kata Hull and Chuck Wisner. He and his family moved to [[Wayland, Massachusetts]], when he was in high school. Adams then attended [[Beaver Country Day School]] before transferring to [[Wayland High School]] during his junior and senior years. Later, he went on to attend Trinity College, where he played soccer. Although he is referred to as a "Boston's Boy," he actually lived in upper-class suburbs for most of his life.

Adams has been involved in music since his childhood; he played piano from the age of 7. At 11 years old, he began to improvise while playing on his piano, to create his own beats and melodies. Adams has stated in interviews that his musical influences have not only come from other rappers, but also from the classic rock, rock, classical music, and blues genres of music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prehILhjlW8 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/prehILhjlW8 |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|title=Sammy Adams interview |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-17 |access-date=2013-09-15}}{{cbignore}}</ref> While seeking to be eclectic, he also stays true to his musical roots so to create a "hip-pop" style in his music.

Adams had aspired to be a producer before he had ever aimed at becoming a rapper. He began writing small raps throughout his time at middle and high school. Adams then started recording songs on his [[MacBook]] in 2008 in the dorms of his college.

The EP topped iTunes' hip-hop charts, driven by the success of "[[Driving Me Crazy]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/sam-adams/bio/1374670#1artist/sam-adams/bio/1374670 |title=Sam Adams |publisher=Billboard |access-date=2013-09-15}}</ref> Adams first EP, ''[[Boston's Boy,]]'' was released on March 4, 2010, by 1st Round Records and reached #73 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and reached #1 on [[iTunes]].  The album was received relatively well critically. The album was praised for its dance beats, catchy lyrics, and overall fun feel. Adams credited his loyal college fan base for the success of Boston's Boy. On July 13, 2010, four extra tracks were released by Adams to create a "deluxe" version of Boston's Boy. They were "Still I Rise," "See Me Now," "Fly Jets Over Boston," and "Just Sayin.'" Two of the songs, "Still I Rise" and "Fly Jets Over Boston," featured special guests G.

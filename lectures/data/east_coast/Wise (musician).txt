'''Leonardo Roman''' (born August 20, 1965), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Wise''', is a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] record producer and member of hip hop group [[Stetsasonic]], commonly hailed as hip hop's first live band.

==Early life==
Born in [[Fajardo, Puerto Rico]], Wise moved to [[the Bronx, New York]], where his parents resided with his two older brothers Juan & Jose. At the age of four, his family moved to East New York, [[Brooklyn, New York]].

==Hip hop career==
[[Daddy-O (rapper)|Daddy-O]] and MC Delite were the founding members of the group [[Stetsasonic]], then known as the Stetsasonic 3 MC's, in [[1981 in music|1981]]. Joining the group in 1983, the group had another level of creativity and talent with the presence of the PRINCE OF SOUND himself, who is also known in the group by the moniker the Stetsa-Human Mix Machine provided [[beatboxing]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Saer|first=Kid|title=Reminiscing with...

Also, what many didn't know was that he was the very first Latino human beat box to hit the hip hop scene.

Wise debuted his Human Turntable technique of beatboxing on the band's first single called "[[Just Say Stet]]" b/w "Rock de la Stet," which was released in 1985. There was also another single from the album in which Wise and Daddy-O collaborated. While Daddy-O performs the vocals, Wise gives his version of "[[Impeach the President]]," which happens to be the very first time that a human beatbox was heard adding a song-like rhythm to the beat that was coming out of his mouth on the song "Faye"{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} which was on the group's first album, ''[[On Fire (Stetsasonic album)|On Fire]]'' ([[1986 in music|1986]]). With Stetsasonic, Wise toured the world with [[rapping|rap]] acts like [[Run-DMC]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Whodini]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[EPMD]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].

In 1989, Wise (with fellow Stetsasonic members Daddy-O, Delite, and Fruitkwan) participated in [[KRS-One]]'s [[Stop the Violence Movement]], an assembly of hip hop artists including [[Kool Moe Dee]], [[Heavy D]], [[MC Lyte]], Public Enemy, and [[Doug E. Fresh]]. This artistic collaboration yielded the [[posse cut]] "[[Self Destruction]]", a [[protest song]] decrying black-on-black violence and media stigmatisation of all hip hop as violent.<ref name="sva">{{Cite web|title=Stop the Violence All-Stars - "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmX5TgWsfEQ Self Destruction]"

Wise has also participated in a few commercials in which he lends his beatbox sounds. One was for Campbell's Soup in which a cartoon of a [[B-boy]] bear kicks a ferocious beat. This commercial was aired amidst [[Saturday morning cartoons]].

Wise was also featured in a [[documentary film|documentary]] on the art of the human beatbox, ''[[Breath Control: The History of the Human Beat Box]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=Breath Control: The History of the Human Beat Box|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|url=https://www.imdb.com/Title?0317197|access-date=2007-02-15}}</ref> which was shown at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and also featured fellow human percussionists such as [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[Biz Markie]], [[Ready Rock C]] and [[Emanon]].

These days Wise & Stetsasonic are presently working on their new album that is scheduled for release in 2022. In this album, Wise is more vocal and less percussionist as his skills have grown greatly. While his moniker as a human percussionist/beatbox is The Human Mix Machine, his new moniker as a Vocalist/MC is Lito Brigante.

==Affiliates==
===Proteges===
Through the years, Rock has helped to jump-start the careers of several artists. His first project outside of Pete Rock & CL Smooth was the hardcore duo [[YG'z]], who released an [[Extended play|EP]] called ''Street Nigga'' in 1993, with four out of the six tracks produced by Rock; however, they were quickly dropped from their deal with Reprise Records. His next venture, [[INI (hip hop group)|INI]], was a group featuring Rock, his younger brother [[Grap Luva]], [[Rass (rapper)|Ras G]] and rapper [[Rob-O]]. They released a single, "Fakin' Jax", through [[Elektra Records]] in 1995, before their debut album, ''[[Lost & Found: Hip Hop Underground Soul Classics|Center of Attention]]'', was shelved by the label. The other two members continue to record solo material, albeit only sporadically. In an interview Rock elaborated on the situation:

{{blockquote|We finished the album, turned it into Elektra and they never put it out, they only put out a single. [[Sylvia Rhone|Sylvia [Rhone]]] really didn't cooperate, she didn't break bread with me when it came down to resolving that. It was all about her changing everything around. She wanted to change my whole sound. When she said, "You gotta make a beat like [[Sean Combs|Puffy]]", I just knew it wasn't going to work out.<ref name="peterock.tribe.net"/>|}}

===Relationship with CL Smooth===
Since their split in 1995, Pete Rock's relationship with CL Smooth has been highly unpredictable. Although the pair briefly united for the reflective "Da Two" from Rock's ''Soul Survivor'' album in 1998, they avoided entertaining requests for a reunion album until 2001, when they once again teamed up for "Back on Da Block" from Rock's ''PeteStrumentals''. In their interviews during this period, it appeared as though a new album was underway. As Rock would explain:

{{blockquote|We've been on tour, we know every rhymer and producer in this business. We've influenced people, even people we've never met have said that we changed the face of hip-hop. So we're going to try to do some more.<ref name="peterock.tribe.net"/>|}}

The pair went on a short international tour culminating in their well-received show at London's Jazz Cafe; however, soon after this they declined to comment any further on the new album, which never materialized (although Smooth did make three separate appearances on ''Soul Survivor II'').  Eventually, Smooth would confirm rumors of a rift in an interview with AllHipHop.com,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allhiphop.com/./features/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422093935/http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=882|url-status=dead|title=AllHipHop.com Exclusive Hip-Hop Features|archive-date=April 22, 2006|access-date=June 26, 2021}}</ref> in which he appeared angry and frustrated with his former partner, saying "I didn't ask him to be a superhero" and "I'm not the problem". In an interview taken in December 2006, Rock ruled out any further collaborations with Smooth but stated that he holds no grudges against his former partner.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhswoGRXhls Pete Rock – 'Interview Pt. 1 (Live At UGHH.com – 12/5/06)'].

==Musical style==
===Production===
[[File:E-mu SP-1200 (111607sp1200).jpg|thumbnail|right|An [[E-mu SP-1200]] that Pete Rock used to create music and beats on one of his many early recordings]]
Pete Rock creates beats from samples, the majority of which are taken from obscure [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[funk music|funk]], and [[jazz music|jazz]] records. This paying true homage to the Black American musical traditions that are the foundation and origins of Hip-Hop music. Early on in his career he would also sample drum breaks such as [[Black Heat]]'s "Zimba Ku" for [[Heavy D & The Boyz]]'s "Letter To The Future". Pete Rock heavily used the [[E-mu SP-1200]] as well as the [[Akai S900|Akai S950]]—later moving onto using the MPC—for his productions. Pete Rock tends to use the samples as palettes for his beats, chopping (cutting the sample into smaller parts), filtering (altering the frequencies of the sample), and layering several samples, often within the same song. While this technique was applied long before Rock (on [[De La Soul]]'s ''[[Three Feet High and Rising]]'' or the work of [[The Bomb Squad]] for example), Rock's work is distinctive for the way in which he uses samples to achieve a hazy, droning effect. He is also noted for his resonant basslines, horn samples, and gritty sounding drums. His beats often sound as though they were being played from an old [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] record; he samples many of his sounds straight off these records.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQWxrWSsI2k YouTube – Pete Rock interview]. YouTube, LLC. Retrieved on December 25, 2008.</ref> He frequently recorded at [[Greene St. Recording]] in [[Manhattan]], having liked the [[equalization (audio)|equalizer]] that was used there, which gave many of his productions a [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] effect.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/sections/microphonecheck/2014/07/01/318561697/pete-rock-real-could-be-another-word-for-original Pete Rock: 'Real Could Be Another Word For Original'] [[NPR]]. Accessed on December 12, 2017.</ref>

Another trait of his, more so in the earlier part of his career, is the way he uses horn samples to supplement his grooves. On "[[They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)]]", Rock uses a horn sample from [[Tom Scott (saxophonist)|Tom Scott]]'s "Today"; he has also used horns on  "Straighten It Out", [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s "Shut 'Em Down", [[Rah Digga]]'s "What They Call Me", and A.D.O.R.'s "Let It All Hang Out".

Along with [[Gang Starr]], [[The Roots]] and [[A Tribe Called Quest]], Pete Rock played a large role in the fusing of jazz and funk music into hip hop. The aforementioned "Reminisce..." withstanding, Rock used many jazz samples on his album ''Mecca and The Soul Brother'', such as [[Cannonball Adderley]]'s "Country Preacher", for the song "Return of the Mecca", or "Capricorn" for the song "In the House" from ''[[The Main Ingredient (Pete Rock & CL Smooth album)|The Main Ingredient]]''. Pete Rock's heavy use of intro and outro beats has also been widely influential. To introduce feature songs, he often plays a short instrumental excerpt, completely different from the rest of the song.  Aside from their role as transitions, these are widely regarded as a way of displaying his large collection and as a challenge to other hip-hop producers to identify the records that the [[Break (music)|breaks]] come from.<ref>Making Beats: The Art of Sample-Based Hip Hop. p. 57 (Middletown, Connecticut: [[Wesleyan University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-8195-6696-9}})</ref> ''Mecca & the Soul Brother'' and ''The Main Ingredient'' use intro/outro beats on nearly every track to great effect, and the tradition continues to the present on Rock's recent releases.

===Remixes===
"Another Pete Rock Remix" is Pete Rock's trademark catchphrase, heard on countless singles that he has [[remix]]ed. In addition to hip-hop artists he has done remix work for artists from other genres such as his 1995 remix of "[[Before You Walk Out Of My Life]]" for [[R&B]] singer [[Monica (singer)|Monica]]. In 1992 he collaborated with [[Mary J. Blige]] on the ''[[What's the 411?]]'' single "Reminisce", which utilized the same sample from his own single "They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)". Rock claims to have done several high-profile remixes that remain unreleased, including one of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Secret (Madonna song)|Secret]]".<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://peterock.tribe.net/thread/032f66d2-a223-400c-a902-fe166be14676 |title=Wax Poetic interview—Pete Rock—tribe.net |publisher=Peterock.tribe.net |date=February 12, 2004 |access-date=May 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220125121/http://peterock.tribe.net/thread/032f66d2-a223-400c-a902-fe166be14676 |archive-date=February 20, 2012  }}</ref> He also claims to have produced the original beat for [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s "[[Juicy (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Juicy]]" and that it was recreated by [[P. Diddy]] and Poke (of [[Trackmasters Entertainment|Tone & Poke]] fame), without consent. However, he was invited to produce the remix, which utilizes the same sample as the original—[[Mtume]]'s "Juicy Fruit".<ref name="peterock.tribe.net"/> Although he received no official producer credit, he made the original demo beat for [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s "[[Jazz (We've Got)]]", which was then recreated by [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] on the album ''The Low End Theory''.<ref name="peterock.tribe.net"/> He remixed [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s "Shut 'em Down" and "Nighttrain" in the same day, starting at 12pm and finishing at 12am.<ref name="peterock.tribe.net"/>

Up until 2003, he created all of his productions on the [[E-mu Systems|E-mu]] SP-1200, thereafter using the [[Akai]] [[Music Production Center|MPC2000XL]]. He also has a collection of about 90,000 records and looks for records at least once a week.<ref name="peterock.tribe.net"/> Pete Rock was one of nine artists who participated in [[thetruth.com]]'s Remix Project, where he remixed the Sunny Side song "Magical Amount".

===Influence===
Pete Rock himself being overwhelmingly influenced by Black American musical traditions of Soul, Jazz, and R&B music, was able to pay it forward. Pete Rock has had a considerable impact on a number of record producers who have emerged in the hip hop scene since the late 1990s. Critics have favorably compared Detroit producer [[J Dilla]] and North Carolina's [[9th Wonder]] to Rock; both of them worked with Rock during their recording careers. Several of the comparisons stem from the fact that these producers have created the bulk of their productions out of samples, as well as the warm, mellow, and exuberant undertones apparent in their work. Pete Rock himself has added validation to the comparisons with J Dilla by stating "he's the only producer in this game that was just as serious [as me]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://artofrhyme.com/interviews/artist/Pete-Rock/88/ |title=Interview with Pete Rock |publisher=Artofrhyme.com |access-date=May 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811213444/http://artofrhyme.com/interviews/artist/Pete-Rock/88/ |archive-date=August 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

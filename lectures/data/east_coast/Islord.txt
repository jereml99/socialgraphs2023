'''Rodney Stevenson''' (born January 31, 1974) better known by his stage name '''Islord''' is a [[rapper]] and a member of the [[hip hop]] group [[Killarmy]]. Although named Rodney Stevenson at birth,he, as all members of Killarmy, is a [[Five-Percent Nation|Five Percenter]], and, thus, changed his name legally to Islord. The first three letters of his name: I, S, L, are also the first three letters of "Islam"; in the Five Percent way of life, "Islam" does not represent the religion but "I.S.L.A.M." which is often represented as  "I Self Lord And Master."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Manifestations of Masculine Magnificence: Divinity in Africana Life, Lyrics, and Literature|last=Washington|first=Teresa N.|publisher=Oya's Tornado|year=2014|isbn=978-0991073009|pages=65, 98, 265}}</ref> The name Islord is a reiteration of the rapper's assertion of his divinity: "I Self Lord," and a fusion of the terms "Islam" and "lord." Islord is also known as the "Thief of Baghdad."<ref>{{cite book | title = [[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]] album booklet | author= Killarmy | author-link= Killarmy | publisher=Wu Tang Records}}</ref> In addition to appearing on Killarmy's albums, Islord appears on two tracks from ''[[Bobby Digital in Stereo]]'' and the song "Holy Water" from Dom Pachino's ''Unreleased'' solo album.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

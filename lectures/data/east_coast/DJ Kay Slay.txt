'''Keith Grayson''' (August 14, 1966 – April 17, 2022), professionally known as '''DJ Kay Slay''', was an American [[disc jockey]] (DJ) from New York City. He is referred to by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "Hip Hop's One-Man Ministry of Insults".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nobodysmiling.com/hiphop/news/86337.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411225243/http://www.nobodysmiling.com/hiphop/news/86337.php|url-status=dead|title=DJ Kay Slay and Shaq Seek to Bridge the Gap|last=Ivey|first=Michael|date=June 16, 2006|website=nobodysmiling.com|archive-date=April 11, 2008|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/arts/music-hip-hop-s-one-man-ministry-of-insults.html|title=Hip-Hop's One-Man Ministry of Insults|last=Ogunnaike|first=Lola|date=May 4, 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 19, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=March 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304014809/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/arts/music-hip-hop-s-one-man-ministry-of-insults.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He released four successful studio albums, ''[[The Streetsweeper, Vol. 1]]'', ''[[The Streetsweeper, Vol. 2]]'', ''[[The Champions: North Meets South]]'' (with Greg Street), and ''[[More Than Just a DJ]]''.

== Early life ==
Grayson was born August 14, 1966, in New York City. He was originally a prominent [[graffiti]] artist, having been featured in the 1983 hip hop documentary, ''[[Style Wars]]''. One of Grayson's better known [[Tag (graffiti)|tags]] was "Dez".<ref name=":0" /> As a youth involved in New York's flourishing [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scene, Keith witnessed firsthand the ascent of legendary disc jockeys such as [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]], and [[Kool DJ Red Alert]], in the late 1970s and into the 1980s. "I didn't so much set out to be a DJ," he said. "It was just something to do that was fun and that I enjoyed doing."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/garysuarez/2019/01/28/dj-kay-slay-reveals-how-he-lands-so-many-hip-hop-greats-on-his-albums/#739d54bc5903|date=January 28, 2019|title=DJ Kay Slay Reveals How He Lands So Many Hip-Hop Greats On His Albums|author=Gary Suarez|website=[[Forbes]]|access-date=July 31, 2020|archive-date=November 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108004119/https://www.forbes.com/sites/garysuarez/2019/01/28/dj-kay-slay-reveals-how-he-lands-so-many-hip-hop-greats-on-his-albums/#739d54bc5903|url-status=live}}</ref> With the decline of the graffiti movement in the late 1980s, Dez began dealing with [[narcotics]] and consequently ended up in jail by the late 1980s. Grayson was released from jail in 1990, and claimed to have abstained from using drugs thereafter. He hailed from the East River Houses located in [[East Harlem]], [[New York City|New York]].In the early years of his life, he also met long-time friend [[Sauce Money]], whom he was friends with until his death.

== Career ==
=== 2003–2009: ''Streetsweeper'' series ===
DJ Kay Slay released his debut album, ''[[The Streetsweeper, Vol. 1]]'', on May 20, 2003. In the summer of 2003, Kay Slay released a [[single (music)|single]], accompanied by a [[music video]], for a song titled "Too Much For Me". The single, which features a [[refrain|chorus]] sung by then-up-and-coming singer [[Amerie]], also features [[verse (popular music)|verses]] from American rappers [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]], and [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]]. The song peaked at number 53 on the US ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, making it the DJ's highest-charting single to date. The single's music video includes [[cameo appearance]]s by [[Swizz Beatz]], [[N.O.R.E.]], [[Raekwon]], [[WC (rapper)|WC]], and [[Lloyd Banks]].{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} Although the song was not a major success, its music video was aired on [[MTV Jams]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]. The "Too Much For Me" video did not feature Nas (because of Nas' solo projects) or Baby; so [[Loon (rapper)|Loon]] was featured instead. This replacement started a feud between Nas and Kay Slay.

On March 30, 2004, Kay Slay's second album ''[[The Streetsweeper, Vol. 2]]'', was released. Another single and video were released for "Who Gives A...Where You From" with [[Three 6 Mafia]], which peaked at number 89 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Kay Slay and the song were featured on the 2004 [[NFL Street]] [[video game]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

=== 2010–2022: ''More Than Just a DJ'' and ''Rhyme or Die'' ===
After releasing ''[[More Than Just a DJ]]'' in 2010, ''Rhyme or Die'' was released. The first album's initial two singles "60 Second Assassins" featuring [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Layzie Bone]], [[Twista]], and [[Jaz-O]] and "The Kings of the Streets" featuring [[DJ Khaled]], [[DJ Drama]], DJ Doo Wop, and Fly Nate were released in 2011. In 2013, "About That Life" featuring [[Fabolous]], [[T-Pain]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Nelly]], and [[French Montana]] was released as a single from ''Rhyme or Die''. It debuted and peaked at #54 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, making it one of Kay Slay's most successful singles to date. In the beginning of 2014, "Free Again" was released featuring [[Fat Joe]] and [[50 Cent]], which came as a surprise for some seeing as how they had "beef" before, but  later reconciled. In 2021, Dj Kay Slay released the track "Rolling 110 Deep" which featured 110 hip hop artists with contributing verses from [[Ice-T]], [[Shaquille O'Neal|Shaq]], [[Coke La Rock]], [[KRS-One]], [[Kool G Rap]], [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Roy Jones Jr.|Roy Jones Jr]], [[Omar Epps]], and others.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Video: DJ Kay Slay Ft.

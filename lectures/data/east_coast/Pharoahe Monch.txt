'''Troy Donald Jamerson''' (born October 31, 1972), better known by his stage name '''Pharoahe Monch''', is an American [[rapper]] known for his complex lyrics, intricate delivery, and internal and [[multisyllabic rhymes|multisyllabic]] rhyme schemes.<ref name = howtorap327>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 327.</ref>

==Biography==
Monch released three albums as part of the rap duo [[Organized Konfusion]] with partner Prince Poetry: The self-titled ''[[Organized Konfusion (album)|Organized Konfusion]]'', ''[[Stress: The Extinction Agenda]]'' and ''[[The Equinox (album)|The Equinox]]''. The duo handled a large amount of production on these albums themselves. All albums received positive critical reviews, but moderate sales. As a result, the duo split up after recording their final album ''The Equinox'' in 1997. Prince Poetry has since denied the possibility of an Organized Konfusion reunion. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Pharoahe Monch then signed to [[Rawkus Records]], an [[indie label]]. After making several guest appearances on albums like the best-selling Rawkus compilation ''[[Soundbombing II]]'', Monch's much-hyped debut, ''[[Internal Affairs (Pharoahe Monch album)|Internal Affairs]]'' was released in 1999. The first single of the album, "[[Simon Says (Pharoahe Monch song)|Simon Says]]", became a hit single, peaking at No.&nbsp;97 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Despite its success, the song caused controversy when Monch was later sued for its unauthorized use of a sample from [[Akira Ifukube]]'s ''Gojira Tai Mosura'', the theme song to the 1992 film ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]''. This resulted in a halting in his album's distribution.

Following the controversy, Pharoahe would not release another solo project for several years, but still released some songs and had guest appearances. In 2000, he collaborated with [[Mos Def]] and [[Nate Dogg]] on the hit song "[[Oh No (Mos Def and Pharoahe Monch song)|Oh No]]" from the Rawkus compilation record ''[[Lyricist Lounge 2]]''. He contributed the song "Fuck You" to the [[Training Day (soundtrack)|''Training Day'' soundtrack]] in 2001, and rapped the theme song to [[Madden NFL 2002]]. He also provided vocals on the track "Last Dayz" on the 2001 [[Adam F]] Album ''Kaos: The Anti-Acoustic Warfare'' and remixes of the track on the follow-up ''Drum & Bass Warfare'', released the following year. In 2003 Pharoahe released his final single through Rawkus Records, "Agent Orange", a war inspired song which revisited the 1991 Organized Konfusion track "Releasing Hypnotical Gases".

There were rumors his next album, at first tentatively titled ''Innervisions'', was to be released under [[Denaun Porter]]'s new [[Shady Records]] imprint Runyon Ave. They reached out to Stevie Wonder and were at the beginning processes of recording the album<ref>{{cite web|title=Hip Hop Icons Series: Pharoahe Monch|url=http://halftimeonline.net/blog/monch/|publisher=Halftimeonline.net|access-date=14 June 2013}}</ref>  but apparently the deal fell through; Monch later announced a deal with [[Street Records Corporation]], home of [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[David Banner]] and [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]]. On December 19, 2006, Pharoahe Monch released his first and only official mixtape, ''The Awakening'', hosted by Clinton Sparks, DJ Boogie Brown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nahright.com/news/2006/12/19/pharoahe-monch-the-awakening |title=Pharoahe Monch – The Awakening |publisher=Nah Right |date=2006-12-19 |access-date=2012-04-17}}</ref> In June 2007, Monch released his second solo album ''[[Desire (Pharoahe Monch album)|Desire]]'' to critical acclaim. Monch said about the album; "...it's very soulful, very [[Gospel music|gospel]], a fresh, new sound for me." The album's lead single was the self-produced track "Push", with "Let's Go" as its [[B-side]]. The song's music video and single were released in late September 2006. Pharoahe Monch released a second music video entitled "When the Gun Draws" at a Brooklyn music festival in February 2007. The track was inspired by a song he did with Prince Po entitled "Stray Bullet" which was featured on the ''[[Stress: The Extinction Agenda]]'' album. A final video was made for the title track "Desire" in late 2007. It was directed by New Zealand director Andy Morton and shot on the Rock the Bells tour with full band. The video features both MeLa Machinko and Showtyme.

On July 9, 2009, Pharoahe Monch allowed hip hop website [[HipHopDX.com]] to leak a song from his forthcoming album ''[[W.A.R. (We Are Renegades)]]''. The song was called "Shine" and featured vocals by MeLa Machinko and was also produced by [[Diamond D]]. On February 14, 2010, another song from Monch was leaked, which is called "Clap (One Day)," produced by [[M-Phazes]].

Pharoahe Monch released his third solo album ''[[W.A.R. (We Are Renegades)]]'' in March 2011. It featured guest appearances from [[Jill Scott (singer)|Jill Scott]], [[Styles P]], [[Citizen Cope]], [[Jean Grae]], [[Royce da 5'9"]], [[Immortal Technique]], [[Vernon Reid]], [[Phonte]], Mr. Porter, Mela Machinko, Showtyme & DJ Boogie Blind.<ref name="okayplayer.com">{{cite web |author=shamz on January 21, 2011 |url=http://www.okayplayer.com/news/audio-pharoahe-monch-clap-one-day-feat-showtyme-dj-boogie-blind.html |title=Audio: Pharoahe Monch "Clap (One Day)" feat.

==Rapping technique==
Pharoahe Monch is acclaimed for his complex rapping technique;<ref name = howtorap327/> [[AllMusic]] says he has, "a reputation as one of [[underground hip hop]]'s pre-eminent lyricists, crafting intricate and intelligent raps."<ref>{{cite web|title=Pharoahe Monch|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/pharoahe-monch-p380987|work=AllMusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=21 May 2012|author=Steve Huey|year=2012}}</ref> [[Kool Moe Dee]] ranks him at 26 in his best MCs of all-time list, from his book, ''[[There's a God on the Mic]]'',<ref name = KMD147>Kool Moe Dee, 2003, ''[[There's A God On The Mic]]: The True 50 Greatest MCs'', Thunder's Mouth Press, p.147.</ref> noting: "Pharoahe Monch is like an eloquent linguistics professor moonlighting as a rhyme serial killer terrorist, challenging the listeners' I.Q. while daring him or her to keep up."<ref name = KMD147/>

Having been afflicted with chronic [[asthma]] since the age of thirteen months,<ref>{{cite web |title=Pharoahe Monch Discusses Chronic Asthma, New "Still Standing" Video |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/pharoahe-monch-discusses-chronic-asthma-new-still-standing-video/ |website=XXL |access-date=30 May 2022 |date=7 February 2012}}</ref> Monch developed new and creative ways to deliver his lyrics when rapping. In an interview with ''[[HipHopDX]]'', he stated that "asthma forced [him] to really go against the issue and push the envelope in terms of breath control," developing a technique he "wouldn't try if [he] didn’t have asthma."<ref>{{cite web |title=Pharoahe Monch Talks Asthma and Rap Delivery |url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.15682/title.pharoahe-monch-talks-asthma-and-rap-delivery |website=HipHopDX |access-date=30 May 2022 |date=22 June 2011}}</ref>

Monch compares writing and recording his lyrics to writing and filming a movie - in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'' he says he will 'punch-in' vocals so he can "retake some things, just like a film",<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 276.</ref> and he 'rewrites' lyrics, saying he will "go back as a screenwriter and rewrite scenes and leave more to the imagination."<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 198-199.</ref>

For his biggest hit, "Simon Says", he comments that he wrote the choruses before he wrote the verses,<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 190.</ref> and fellow rapper and collaborator [[O.C. (rapper)|O.C.]] notes that Monch will write single lines down and then use them five years later.<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 164.</ref> His vocal delivery is inspired by [[Jazz]] music and musicians such as [[John Coltrane]].<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 255-256.</ref>

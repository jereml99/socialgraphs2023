He decided to pursue a life in music when he was 21. At the beginning of his career, he wrote over 100 songs which were never released, but drastically helped him improve his writing and delivery.<ref name="all"/>

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Rutling was a [[Paraprofessional educator|paraprofessional]] in New York City public schools for 10 years before he decided to pursue a musical career.<ref name="alum"/> During his time as a paraeducator, Rutling worked with [[special education]] students and often worked in [[youth detention center]]s. At the time, he made music on the side as a novice; however, it wasn't until he realized his potential talent that he decided to focus on music full-time.<ref name="alum"/> In addition to making music, Rutling also owns a clothing line named "SO BarKlay Apparel."<ref name="aahh"/>

=== Musical career ===
Phresher released his debut song, "Polo Song", in 2010. Around 2012, Phresher started to release singles, EPs, and music videos onto the internet, which saw minor success. He released his debut mixtape, ''Take It Personal'', in 2015.<ref name="complex"/> In 2016, his single "Wait a Minute" was pitched to the YouTube global music team by The Young 'N Grateful Group, becoming an instant success. Following "Wait a Minute" receiving several million views, the video caught the attention of rapper [[50 Cent]], who later appeared on a remix of the song along with rapper [[Remy Ma]]. The song appeared as a bonus cut on the [[DJ Whoo Kid]] mixtape ''Lost Flash Drive'' and released on G-Unit Records. Rapper [[Royce da 5'9"]] also put forth a freestyle remix over "Wait a Minute." Following Royce promoting the remix via social media, Eminem made a notable mention of the freestyle. [[Eminem]]'s heavy revere as to Royce's word play ultimately led the Detroit rapper to become interested in Phresher.<ref name="xxlmag.com">{{cite web|url= http://www.xxlmag.com/video/2017/12/phresher-eminem-discovering-him-royce-59-wait-a-minute/|title= Phresher Recalls Eminem Discovering Him Through Royce 5'9'' – XXL}}</ref>

In 2017, Phresher's management duo Jay Andino and Michael Caseau had become sought after by Shady Records staff; initially, to aid in production for the upcoming ''[[Revival (Eminem album)|Revival]]'' album. After several hundred instrumentals were sent by the Young 'N Grateful collective to no avail, Caseau suggested to Shady Records A&R's, stating:
:''"Phresher collaborating with Em' could give that same platform and vibe Royce gave on the remix. Instead of using a similar beat, we just need any beat with him on it to recreate the energy, not the sound design.”<ref name="xxlmag.com"/>

Thereafter, Caseau worked closely with [[Shady Records]]' A&Rs. In 2017, Eminem's long-time manager [[Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|Paul Rosenberg]] contacted Andino, stating Eminem had interest in collaborating with Phresher.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/royce-da-59-wait-a-minute-freestyle-new-song.1972468.html|title=Royce Da 5'9" – Wait A Minute (Freestyle)|website=HotNewHipHop|last=Goddard|first=Kevin|date=January 6, 2017|access-date=May 9, 2018}}</ref> Eminem's mix engineer flew to New York to meet with Phresher to record "Chloraseptic," listed as track No. 3 on ''Revival''. Phresher spoke about the collaboration, stating:
:''"When I first heard that he wanted me on the project, I was astonished. I didn't believe anything until they actually flew in and recorded the record. That's when I was like, 'Oh! This is real.' It was about two months ago, three the most. That was just amazing, man. We met in the studio. That was just crazy."''<ref name="complex">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2017/12/eminem-phresher-chloraseptic-revival-interview|title=Phresher Speaks on Collaborating With Eminem for "Chloraseptic": 'It's Raw as F*ck'|website=Complex|date=December 5, 2017|access-date=May 9, 2018}}</ref>

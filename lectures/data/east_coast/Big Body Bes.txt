==Early life==
Bes was born in [[New York City]] to [[Albania]]n parents who immigrated from southern Albania in 1983. He was raised in the quiet Lindenwood section of New York City. Bes met future collaborators Meyhem Lauren and Action Bronson at the age of 15.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Don’t Call Him a Weed Carrier: Meet Big Body Bes, Action Bronson’s Albanian Cousin |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2014/04/big-body-bes-interview |access-date=2022-11-18 |website=Complex |language=en}}</ref> Bes received the nickname "Big Body" due to his large stature.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=C.M |first=Emmanuel C.

== Career ==
Bes began his music career in 2011 at the age of 27, on Action Bronson's debut album ''Dr. Lecter'' with his forte of [[spoken word]], a strong composition of the elements of NYC street life, economic struggle and barbaric humor.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Big Body Bes Explains the 8 Bodega Commandments |url=https://firstwefeast.com/eat/2015/05/big-body-bes-bodega-commandments |access-date=2022-11-18 |website=First We Feast |language=en}}</ref> Bes rejects the notion that he's a "hypeman" or that his features on Bronson's songs are "skits", going as far as to say "...I wouldn’t even call them features, I would call them experiences". He considers his "breakout" appearance to be his feature on "9-24-11" off Bronson's mixtape Blue Chips.<ref name=":0" />

Starting in 2016, Bes has also been on a TV show called ''[[Traveling the Stars: Action Bronson and Friends Watch 'Ancient Aliens']]''. Other hosts include Action Bronson, [[Knxwledge]], [[ScHoolboy Q]], [[Earl Sweatshirt]], [[Tyler, The Creator]], [[Andy Milonakis]], [[Simon Rex|Dirt Nasty]], [[MC Eiht]], [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], [[Eric André]], [[Too $hort]], and [[Melissa Etheridge]]. In the first episode of the series, Bes declares he doesn't believe in dinosaurs.

Bes has stated that he was once known as Jerome, and has a cousin named Stacks. <ref>F*ck That's Delicious, Episode 2, March-10-2016</ref>

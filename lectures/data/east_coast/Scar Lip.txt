According to her, she was abused by her aunt and uncle while living with them.<ref name="hnhhwho" /> She was eventually kicked out of her aunt's house and put into foster care, which led to her often moving between foster homes and detention centers in places such as Pennsylvania and [[Coney Island]]. She was first inspired to pursue music by her admiration for rapper [[DMX]] and posted her first rap video online in 2018, which went viral online the following year.<ref name="animconvo" /> Her first three songs, "Therapy", "Suicide Awareness", and "Foster Care", were recorded from 2019 to 2020.<ref name="xxlbreak" />

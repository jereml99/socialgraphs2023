'''Keith Omar Murray'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/writer/337990426/MURRAY%20KEITH%20OMAR|title=ACE Repertory: MURRAY KEITH OMAR|publisher=[[ASCAP]]|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref> (born September 13, 1974) is an American rapper from New York. He is best known for being a member of the hip hop group [[Def Squad]], which includes fellow rappers [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and fellow Long Island native [[Erick Sermon]].

Murray debuted his spaced out, complex, multi-syllable rhyming style in 1994, when Murray recorded his debut single, "[[The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World (song)|The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World]]" for [[Jive Records]], which was quickly followed up by his debut [[The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World|album of the same name]], released to critical and commercial success. Along with Def Squad, he was a part of their debut album, [[El Niño (Def Squad album)|''El Niño'']] in 1998.

==Career==
=== 1990–1995: Early years ===
Murray got his start in the music industry under the name MC Do Damage, but later decided to just go by his birth name.

In 1994, he was introduced to Erick Sermon of [[EPMD]] by his friend [[K-Solo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whomag.net/keith-murray/|title=Keith Murray|website=Who?Mag |first=Will|last=Hernandez|date=May 29, 2014 |quote="Through K Solo. I heard Erick lived in the town over to Central Islip, Long Island. He moved to my town and we ran into him and K Solo when we used to be hustling at selling crack. He came up there and I told him to take to Erick Sermon because I didn't know him them. He took me and it's been popping ever since."}}</ref> Sermon included Murray on his album ''[[No Pressure (Erick Sermon album)|No Pressure]]'' on the single "Hostile", with critics praising Murray's lyrical ability. His appearance on Hostile led to Murray being signed to [[Jive Records]], and work began on his first album. Murray's debut single, ''[[The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World (song)|The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World]]'' was released in 1994 and was a hit.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|location=New York City|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|pages=230–1}}</ref> The song was produced by [[Erick Sermon]] (who also provided background vocals) and peaked at number 50 on the [[Billboard 200]] and number 3 on the [[Hot Rap Songs|Hot Rap Singles chart]]. Murray's debut album ''[[The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World]]'', was named after the single and released in 1994 to widespread critical acclaim and commercial success,<ref name="LarkinDM"/> being certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in August 1995.<ref name="KeithMurrayRIAA">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Keith%20Murray&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum - November 15, 2006 : Search Results - Keith Murray|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]|access-date=November 15, 2006}}</ref> The album was also given "4 mics" by ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''.

Murray continued to enjoy a high media-profile by appearing on a [[Coca-Cola]] advertisement and as a featured guest on [[Mary J Blige]]'s "[[Be Happy (Mary J. Blige song)|Be Happy]]", [[Total (group)|Total]]'s "[[Can't You See (Total song)|Can't You See]]", [[R Kelly]]'s [[R. (R. Kelly album)|"Home Alone"]] and both versions of [[LL Cool J]]'s "[[I Shot Ya]]".<ref name="LarkinDM"/> However, his appearances of both versions of "I Shot Ya" led to brief friction with rapper [[Tupac Shakur]], who believed that the song was a diss towards him being shot and robbed at Quad Recording Studios, regarding the timing, title, and lyrical content.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2010/09/tupac-talks-hit-em-vs-who-shot-ya-pg-2|title=Tupac Talks 'Hit Em Up' Vs.

Upon questioning, Murray made it clear that the record was not about Shakur, peacefully resolving the situation. Murray has continued to publicly address this in several interviews over the following years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.30128/title.keith-murray-recalls-tupac-approaching-him-over-i-shot-ya|title=Keith Murray Recalls Tupac Approaching Him Over "I Shot Ya"|website=Hiphopdx.com|first=Danielle|last=Harling|date=August 7, 2014|quote="Rest in peace to Tupac.

Walked up and he was like 'Nah, I just wanted to know because we had—I got shot five times. You know what I'm saying? In New York, so I thought niggas was talking about me'…I can understand why he did that…We was squaring off. Everybody had knives on 'em.

Despite the success and acclaim of his first album on Def Jam after this, Murray was dropped from the label just one day after its release after being accused of choking two label employees, although he said the confrontation was limited to words. After being released, Murray announced plans to continue recording music independently.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Reid |first1=Shaheem |title=Keith Murray Declares His Independence After Being Dropped By Def Jam |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1474254/keith-murray-declares-his-independence-after-being-dropped-by-def-jam/ |website=MTV News |language=en |date=July 18, 2003}}</ref>

== Legal issues ==

In May 25, 1995, Murray was arrested after being accused of hitting a man with a barstool in a fight and released on bail. After being sentenced to three years in 1998, Murray, who maintains his innocence, fled from authorities until October 1998, when he turned himself in. Murray filed a lawsuit for [[wrongful conviction]], and later dropped the suit in exchange for his sentence being reduced by three months. Murray served the latter portion of his sentence in the Maple Street Halfway House facility before being released on May 14, 2001.<ref name=halfway/>

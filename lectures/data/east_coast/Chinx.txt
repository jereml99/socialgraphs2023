'''Lionel Du Fon Pickens''' (December 4, 1983 – May 17, 2015),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/work/889236778|title = ACE Repertory}}</ref> better known by his stage name '''Chinx''' (formerly '''Chinx Drugz'''), was an American [[rapping|rapper]]. He was a member of The Rockaway Riot Squad alongside fellow slain rapper Stack Bundles. Chinx later joined [[French Montana]]'s [[Coke Boys Records]], gaining recognition for his appearances on the ''Coke Boys'' mixtapes and the ''Cocaine Riot'' mixtape series. He was killed in a [[drive-by shooting]] in [[Jamaica, Queens]] on May 17, 2015. Two men have since been arrested in the case.

==Early life==

===1983–1999: Beginnings===

Chinx was born and raised in [[Far Rockaway, Queens]] on December 4, 1983, living in both Redfern Houses and Edgemere Houses, now known as Ocean Bay Apartments. He spent time in [[North Amityville]] in his teenage years where he briefly attended high school.<ref name="xxlmag1">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2012/02/the-break-presents-chinx-drugz|title=The Break Presents: Chinx Drugz|publisher=Xxlmag.com|date=2012-02-17 |access-date=2013-10-01}}</ref> When speaking of how he started rapping, Chinx said, "I started rapping at the table in junior high school for fun with the homies, and then by 9th grade is when I started taking music seriously. At that point is when I started investing my street money into my studio time and trying to find my sound."<ref name="xxlmag1"/>

He said he got the name "Chinx Drugz" since he "used to smoke a lot of [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]] back in the day, and this older chick used to call me [[chink]]y and it stuck; the Drugz, well, that’s self explanatory — I been slangin’ on these corners."<ref name="urbfeed2268">{{cite web|url=http://urbfeed.com/?p=2268|title=Chinx Drugz: UrbFeed Interview &#124; Urb Feed - Entertainment Music Interviews and More|publisher=Urb Feed|access-date=2013-10-01|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102184813/http://urbfeed.com/?p=2268|archive-date=2013-01-02}}</ref>

==Career==

===2000–2010: Riot Squad and ''Hurry Up & Die'' series===
Chinx first started rapping with his close friend Stack Bundles while he was in high school, whom he would later form the group Riot Squad with, along with local rappers Bynoe and Cau2Gs. The group started to gain a buzz throughout New York but that ended abruptly in early 2005 when Chinx was sentenced to nearly 5 years in prison. He served his time at [[Arthur Kill Correctional Facility]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Diep|first=Eric|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2014/05/chinx-mixtape-guide|title=Chinx Lists His Five Essential Mixtapes You Should Check Out - XXL|publisher=Xxlmag.com|date=2014-05-26 |access-date=2015-05-17}}</ref><ref name="xxlmag4"/> 
During this time, Bundles formed a friendship with rapper [[Max B]], and together they joined [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]]' group [[Byrd Gang]].<ref name="xxlmag4">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/11/chinx-steps-out-of-french-montanas-shadow|title=Chinx Steps Out Of French Montana's Shadow - XXL|date=26 November 2013 |publisher=Xxlmag.com|access-date=2013-11-27}}</ref>

While Chinx was incarcerated, on June 11, 2007,  fellow rapper and friend Stack Bundles was shot and killed. In late 2008, Chinx was released from prison and through his affiliation with the now deceased Bundles, he met Max B. The following year, Max B introduced Chinx to fellow New York rapper [[French Montana]], who was still relatively unknown at the time. Together, Chinx and Montana formed the [[hip hop group]], [[Coke Boys]].<ref name="urbfeed2268"/> On April 13, 2009, Drugz released his first solo mixtape, ''Hurry Up & Die Vol. 1: Get Ya Casket On''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xclusiveszone.net/2009/04/mixtape-chinx-drugz-hurry-up-die-get-ya|title=[Mixtape&#93; Chinx Drugz – Hurry Up & Die (Get Ya Casket On)|publisher=Xclusives Zone |date=2009-04-13|access-date=2013-10-01}}</ref><ref name="complex1">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/03/15-unsigned-rappers-who-should-get-a-deal-after-sxsw/chinx-drugz|title=Chinx Drugz — 15 Unsigned Rappers Who Should Get a Deal After SXSW|publisher=Complex.com|date=2013-03-15|access-date=2013-10-01}}</ref>

Drugz told [[MTV]] that, "When I was making this mixtape, I was just trying to give the people something a little different from my normal. I basically started messing with a couple of different beats, but I kept it real New York. But I just really wanted to give 'em the other side of Chinx that they ain't been hearing in a while."<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The mixtape closes with "Maybe", a tribute to his deceased childhood friend Stack Bundles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/r`views/2013/04/mixtape-review-chinx-drugz-cocaine-riot-3|title=Mixtape Review: Chinx Drugz, Cocaine Riot 3 - XXL|publisher=Xxlmag.com|date=2013-04-19|access-date=2013-10-01}}</ref>

In a positive review ''XXL'' stated, "For all its signs of promise, ''Cocaine Riot 3'' also has some rookie mistakes. There’s also an over-reliance on features here that the mixtape could do without. The heavy guest list prevents ''Cocaine Riot 3'' from being a landmark release, and so this mixtape ends up being more of a continuation of what we’ve already heard from Chinx Drug, rather than a step to the next level. Time will tell if he’s up for that challenge."<ref name="xxlmag3"/>

'''Darryl Hill''', (born September 18, 1968) better known by his stage name '''Cappadonna''', is an American [[rapper]]. He is a member of the hip hop collective [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and is a member of the hip hop group [[Theodore Unit]] together with [[Ghostface Killah]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-10-07|title=RZA Reveals Cappadonna's Status In Wu-Tang Clan|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.30967/title.rza-reveals-cappadonnas-status-in-wu-tang-clan|access-date=2021-08-02|website=HipHopDX}}</ref>

==Career==
Cappadonna (also known as Cappachino) was known to the future members of the Wu-Tang Clan, and had been [[U-God]]'s mentor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?boardid=41&threadid=39731|title=XXL Article On The Making Of "Only Built 4 Cuban Linx".|website=www.ilxor.com|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref> However, Cappadonna went to prison and was replaced in the group by [[Method Man]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Th4TZsr8I4 |title=RZA Explains The Origin Of The Wu-Tang To Funkmaster Flex |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2013-02-14}}</ref>

Cappadonna made his recording debut as an affiliate of the Wu-Tang Clan on [[Raekwon]]'s 1995 single "[[Ice Cream (Raekwon song)|Ice Cream]]" on ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]''. He was also a guest star, along with Raekwon, on [[Ghostface Killah]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Ironman (Ghostface Killah album)|Ironman]]''. He made his first appearance on a Wu-Tang Clan album in 1997 on ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'' on the single "[[Triumph (Wu-Tang Clan song)|Triumph]]". Following his appearance on ''Forever'', he contributed significantly{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2018}} to the group's third studio album, ''[[The W]]'', at which point his appearances were no longer marked with "Featuring Cappadonna", as they had been on ''Forever''. After a falling-out with [[RZA]] the next year over royalties, he did not appear at all on the group's subsequent album ''[[Iron Flag]]''. He reunited with the group for their concert at 2004's [[Rock the Bells]], and appeared on 2007 release ''[[8 Diagrams]]''.

Cappadonna's status as a Wu-Tang member or as a featured artist has varied throughout the years, while long referred to by both the group and fans as the "Unofficial Tenth Member". Also, while his vocals on ''8 Diagrams'' were not marked with "Feat. Cappadonna", much like ''The W'', he does not appear on the front cover with the original eight living members, and is not featured in the album's booklet with a picture, although he is included in the group's shout-outs sections. In a press conference held October 2, 2014, at Warner Studios for the upcoming release of the Wu-Tang Clan's ''A Better Tomorrow'' album, RZA clarified any misunderstanding of Cappadonna's affiliation with Wu-Tang Clan, stating that Cappadonna has been an official member of Wu-Tang Clan since ''8 Diagrams''.<ref name="Wu Tang Status">{{cite web|title=RZA Reveals Cappadonna's Status In Wu-Tang Clan|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.30967/title.rza-reveals-cappadonnas-status-in-wu-tang-clan|access-date=2014-10-17|publisher=HipHopDX}}</ref>

Cappadonna's first solo effort was 1998's ''[[The Pillage]]'' which debuted and peaked at number 3 on the charts and certified Gold. His follow-up - 2001's ''[[The Yin and the Yang|The Ying and The Yang]]'' - debuted at number 51 on the charts. Staying vigilant in his support of The Clan, he then featured on over 25 releases including classics from Raekwon, Method Man and Ghostface. 
 
Known for his colorful wardrobe, he frequently refers to fashion designers and his large collection of boutique clothing in his raps.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In 2019 Cappadonna was featured in ''[[Wu-Tang Clan: Of Mics and Men]],'' a documentary in honor of the 25th anniversary of Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, ''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/wu-tang-clan-of-mics-and-men-interview.html|title=The Wu-Tang Clan Looks Back on 25 Years|website=www.vulture.com|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref>

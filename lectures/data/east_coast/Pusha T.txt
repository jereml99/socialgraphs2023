He rose to prominence as one-half of the Virginia-based hip hop duo [[Clipse]], which was mainly active from 1994 to 2010, alongside his older brother [[No Malice]]. As Clipse, the two released three studio albums upon signing to [[Pharrell Williams|Pharrell]]'s [[Star Trak Entertainment]]; the albums spawned hit singles including "[[Grindin']]" and "[[When the Last Time]]" (both 2002).

In September 2010, Pusha T signed a deal with [[Kanye West]]'s [[GOOD Music]] imprint, under the aegis of [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Later that year, he was featured on West's single "[[Runaway (Kanye West song)|Runaway]]," which peaked at number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 2011, he released his first solo project, the mixtape ''Fear of God'', which was followed up with his debut solo album, ''[[My Name Is My Name]]'', released in 2013. In November 2015, West appointed Pusha T to take over his role as president of GOOD Music, where he remained one of its flagship artists until parting ways with the label in 2022. 

Pusha T has released a further three solo albums: ''[[King Push – Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude]]'' (2015), ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'' (2018), and ''[[It's Almost Dry]]'' (2022), all receiving widespread critical acclaim; the latter was Pusha T's first number one debut on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |date=2022-05-01 |title=Pusha T Scores First No. 1 Album on Billboard 200 Chart With 'It's Almost Dry' |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/pusha-t-its-almost-dry-billboard-200-chart-debut-1235065350/ |access-date=2022-07-03 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Pusha T was born Terrence LeVarr Thornton on May 13, 1977, in the [[Bronx]] borough of New York City, though the family soon relocated to [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], where he and his brother, [[No Malice|Gene Thornton]], grew up.<ref name="vv">{{cite web |last=Mlynar |first=Phillip |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/05/pusha_t_present.php |title=Pusha T Presents: A Clipse Guide to New York City - New York - Music - Sound of the City |publisher=Blogs.villagevoice.com |date=May 5, 2010 |access-date=November 12, 2012 |archive-date=January 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104051821/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/05/pusha_t_present.php |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/8449-5-10-15-20-pusha-t/ |title=5-10-15-20: Pusha-T &#124; Features |publisher=Pitchfork |date=July 14, 2011 |access-date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> As teenagers, the brothers both sold drugs, with Gene eventually being kicked out of their parents' house after they discovered what he was doing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopwired.com/258482/12-rappers-who-actually-sold-drugs-for-real-photos/|title=12 Rappers Who Actually Sold Drugs, For Real [PHOTOS]|website=Hiphopwired.com|date=October 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.25800/title.pusha-t-details-when-his-parents-found-out-he-sold-drugs|title=Pusha T Details When His Parents Found Out He Sold Drugs|date=October 14, 2013|website=HipHopDX.com}}</ref> In 1992, alongside his brother, the two began to pursue a career in [[hip hop music|hip hop]], forming a group known as [[Clipse]]. His older brother Gene was known for most of the group's duration as Malice (the two were originally known as '''Terrar''' and Malicious, respectively, and in 2012 Gene changed his stage name to [[No Malice]], following a [[conversion to Christianity]]).

===1993–2010: Clipse===
{{Main|Clipse}}
[[File:Pusha T in Cambridge 3.jpg|thumb|left|Pusha T performing at [[The Middle East (nightclub)|The Middle East]] in 2007 as part of [[Clipse]]]]
Shortly after forming Clipse, the brothers were introduced to record producer and fellow Virginian [[Pharrell Williams]] of [[The Neptunes]], who helped them secure a recording contract with [[Elektra Records]] in 1997.<ref name="pitchfork1">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6551-clipse/|title=Interviews: Clipse|last=Maher|first=Dave|date=February 26, 2007|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=July 30, 2013}}</ref> Terrence initially took the stage name '''Terrar'''. After being signed to Elektra, they began working on their debut album, ''[[Exclusive Audio Footage]]''. After recording the entire album, they released one single, "The Funeral", which was commercially unsuccessful and eventually led to the release of the album being cancelled and Clipse being dropped from the label shortly after. After being dropped, Terrar changed his name to '''Pusha T''', and despite not being signed to a major label, he made numerous appearances on other artists' songs, appearing on [[Kelis]]' 1999 single "[[Good Stuff (Kelis song)|Good Stuff]]" and [[Nivea (singer)|Nivea]]'s 2001 single "[[Run Away (I Wanna Be with U)]]", respectively, thanks to his relationship with The Neptunes, who produced both songs.

In early 2001, Pharrell Williams signed the duo to [[Arista Records]] through his recently established [[Star Trak Entertainment|Star Trak]] imprint. Clipse began working on their major label debut, executively produced by The Neptunes. Their debut single, ''[[Grindin']]'' was released on May 14, 2002, and became a summer Top 40 hit, reaching number 30 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on July 30, 2002. Similar success followed with their second single, ''[[When the Last Time]]'', which peaked at #19. Fueled by two successful singles, Clipse released their commercial debut album ''[[Lord Willin']]'' on August 20, 2002, debuting at #1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-hop Album chart and #4 on the [[Billboard 200]], eventually being certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on October 1, 2002.

In late 2003, Clipse began recording material for their second album, ''[[Hell Hath No Fury (Clipse album)|Hell Hath No Fury]]''.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> However, further work on the album ground to a halt in 2004, when [[Arista Records]]'s urban artists were absorbed into its sister label [[Jive Records]] as part of a larger merger between [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Due to contractual requirements, Clipse was forced to stay on Jive, while Star Trak and the rest of its roster moved to their new home at [[Interscope Records]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> While Clipse resumed work on the album, and eventually finished recording it, the duo became increasingly frustrated with Jive, as the label was notorious for overlooking various hip-hop/R&B artists in favor of more pop-oriented acts on its roster. The label's musical strategy expansion caused numerous delays in the release of ''Hell Hath No Fury''.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> As delays continued, the group asked for a formal release from its contract. When Jive refused to grant this request, the duo sued the label.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> In response to this, in 2004, the brothers launched their own record label imprint, Re-Up Records, and formed the hip hop group [[Re-Up Gang]], along with fellow rappers [[Ab-Liva]] and Sandman.

On May 9, 2006, Clipse finally reached an agreement with Jive to release the album through both Re-Up and Jive.<ref name="Reference 2">{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5650|title=Clipse Tour With Ice Cube; Album Release Date Set|format=Online news article|work=AllHipHop.com|access-date=June 11, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521025035/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5650 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=May 21, 2006}}</ref> ''Hell Hath No Fury'' was finally released on November 28, 2006. Once again produced by [[The Neptunes]], it debuted at #14 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with over 80,000 copies sold in the 1st week. While the album received a great deal of critical acclaim, its sales were less successful than Lord Willin'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/bloggers/2006/12/clipse-catch-a-brick/ |title=Clipse catch a brick |publisher=Xxlmag.Com |access-date=February 21, 2012}}</ref><ref name="pitchfork1"/> It spawned two moderately successful singles: "[[Mr. Me Too]]" with [[Pharrell Williams]] and "[[Wamp Wamp (What It Do)]]" with [[Slim Thug]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Clipse's frustrations with Jive were a constant theme of the album, with Pusha T saying ''"I'm sorry to the fans, but them crackers weren't playing fair at Jive"'' on the track ''Mr. Me Too''.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> The [[hip hop music|hip hop]] magazine ''[[XXL magazine|XXL]]'' gave the album a "XXL" rating, marking it as a five-star album. At the time only five albums had previously received that honor.<ref name="pitchfork1"/>  [[File:Pusha T.jpg|thumb|upright|Pusha T performing at the 2007 [[Pitchfork Music Festival|''Pitchfork'' Music Festival]]]]

In a May 19, 2007, interview with ''[[Eye Weekly]]'', Clipse revealed that they had been officially released from any contractual obligations with Jive.<ref name="Reference 3">{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_05.17.07/music/feature.php|title=Keys Open Doors|format=Print interview|work=Eye Weekly|access-date=May 22, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000821/http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_05.17.07/music/feature.php|archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> After this, the duo began discussions with several record labels, eventually signing with [[Columbia Records]] on October 26, 2007.<ref name="Reference 5">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047652/exclusive-the-clipse-signs-with-columbia|title=The Clipse Signs With Columbia|format=Online news article|work=Billboard.com|access-date=October 26, 2007}}</ref> The follow-up to ''Hell Hath No Fury'', titled ''[[Til the Casket Drops (Clipse album)|Til the Casket Drops]]'', was released on December 8, 2009, via Columbia Records.<ref name="Release Date">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=52393|title=CLIPSE to drop casket in October|work=xxlmag.com|access-date=July 24, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092557/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=52393|archive-date=July 23, 2009}}</ref> In a departure from the group's previous works, which only featured production from the Neptunes, the album features production from [[Sean "Diddy" Combs]]' production team [[The Hitmen (production team)|The Hitmen]], and [[DJ Khalil]] among others.

===2010–2011: Solo career beginnings===
After releasing their third album, Pusha T and Malice announced Clipse would be going on indefinite hiatus so the brothers could focus on their solo careers. Shortly after this, Pusha T was signed to [[Kanye West]]'s [[GOOD Music]] label in September 2010, and made his first appearance as a member of the GOOD roster on Kanye West's ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'', appearing on his hit "[[Runaway (Kanye West song)|Runaway]]" and premiering the song with him at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]] on September 12, 2010. He was also featured on several tracks from West's [[GOOD Fridays]] series and made other appearances on [[Swizz Beatz]]'s Monster Mondays series, [[Lloyd Banks]]' ''[[H.F.M. 2 (Hunger for More 2)]]'' and [[Tabi Bonney]]'s ''Fresh'', respectively. On the week of December 16, 2010, Pusha T signed an exclusive management deal with [[NUE Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encore.celebrityaccess.com/?encoreId=281&articleId=37618 |title=ENCORE: The Standard in Live Entertainment News |publisher=Encore.celebrityaccess.com |date=December 16, 2010 |access-date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> On February 11, 2011, [[Funkmaster Flex]] debuted Pusha T's debut solo single on [[New York City]]'s [[WQHT|Hot 97]].<ref>[http://nahright.com/news/2011/02/12/pusha-t-my-god-prod-by-hit-boy-no-tags/ Pusha T – My God (Prod. by Hit-Boy) (No Tags)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118015434/http://nahright.com/news/2011/02/12/pusha-t-my-god-prod-by-hit-boy-no-tags/ |date=November 18, 2015 }} Nah Right</ref> The track, titled "My God", was produced by [[Hit-Boy]] and was generally well received by the public.

=== 2022-present: Heir Wave Music Group and departure from GOOD Music ===
In December 2022, Pusha T announced his departure from GOOD Music after founder Kanye West's [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[White Lives Matter|pro-race]] remarks. Speaking on West's support for "White Lives Matter", his [[Kanye West 2024 presidential campaign|2024 presidential campaign]] and other public outbursts, Pusha T stated that they were nothing to "tap dance around".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Garcia |first=Thania |date=2022-12-20 |title=Pusha T Confirms He's Cut All Ties With Kanye West's G.O.O.D.

== Feuds ==

===Consequence===
After Pusha T released "My God", the first single from his solo mixtape, his former [[GOOD Music]] label-mate [[Consequence (rapper)|Consequence]] took to [[Twitter]] and claimed Pusha T stole his flow and lyrics from a song of his that Pusha T was supposed to appear on, titled "The Last Supper".<ref>[http://www.complex.com/music/2011/02/consequence-claims-pusha-t-stole-lines-on-my-god Consequence Claims Pusha T Stole Lines on "My God"] Complex.com</ref> On July 22, 2011, Consequence released a song titled "The Plagiarist Society" where he takes shots and questions Pusha T's [[Mafioso rap|coke-dealing raps]]. Towards the end of the record, the Queens native promises to take aim at Kanye West next saying "You're nothing but a body shield, for that coward from the mid-west/ so yes you can bet, that your boss is next".

Pusha T responded to the diss track when he appeared on [[WGCI-FM|Chicago's 107.5 WGCI's The Morning Riot]] and said nobody is looking for Consequence, as for if he would respond on a record, Pusha T went on to say "At the end of the day I am an artist and this whole rap thing is fun to me, so I can't say you won't hear nothing, but to go back and forth with him, it's not right, I won't get anything out of it."<ref>[http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2011/07/28/pusha-t-responds-to-consequence/ Pusha T Responds To Consequence] 2dopeboyz.com</ref> Later that day, Consequence called into Chicago's WGCI's The Morning Riot in retaliation to the remarks Pusha T made about him. He also premiered a song titled "Everybody Told Me 2 (Straighten It Out)" where he disses West, Pusha T and GOOD Music in general.<ref>[http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2011/07/29/consequence-responds-to-pusha-t/ Consequence Responds To Pusha T, Drops G.O.O.D.

Music Diss)] 2dopeboyz.com</ref> Since then Pusha T has responded to Consequence on a record. The song was the remix to [[Ace Hood]]'s "[[Go 'N' Get It]]" which also featured [[Beanie Sigel]], [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Styles P]]. In the song Pusha raps "Consequence, nigga, talk is cheap You don't want a problem? Off the beef Before I off his ass with his awful teeth". On August 19, Consequence released ''Movies on Demand 3'' and continued to [[Diss track|diss]] his former label and Pusha T on songs such as "Career Killer" and "Mr.RapFix (Hot Water)".

On September 15, 2011, Consequence appeared on [[MTV]]'s Rap Fix and announced his feud with Kanye West and GOOD Music was over.<ref>[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.16874/title.consequence-says-feud-is-over-with-kanye-west-continues-feud-with-q-tip Consequence Says "Feud Is Over With Kanye West," Continues Feud With Q-Tip] HipHopDX.com</ref> While out in Chicago in October 2011, Pusha T appeared on WGCI radio for a second time, and confirmed that the "beef" was indeed over, that it had died out and they have moved on. In January 2015, the two officially ended the feud when Consequence took to his Instagram page to let the people know: "All G.O.O.D. in 2015, Pusha [T] and I deaded everything and we creatively vibed with Kanye for this [[The Life of Pablo|new LP]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/pusha-t-and-consequence-end-beef-to-work-on-kanye-west-s-new-album-news.13802.html |title=Pusha T & Consequence End Beef To Work On Kanye West's New Album |website=Hotnewhiphop.com |date=January 29, 2015 |access-date=January 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/everything-we-know-about-kanye-wests-swish-news.17030.html?image=0&gallery=2 |title=Everything We Know About Kanye West's "SWISH" |website=Hotnewhiphop.com |date=August 13, 2015 |access-date=January 1, 2016}}</ref>

===Lil Wayne===
The tension between Pusha T and rapper [[Lil Wayne]] had been going on for years, beginning soon after [[Clipse]] and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] worked on "What Happened to That Boy", the latter's 2002 single. In 2006, Wayne felt the Clipse song "[[Mr. Me Too]]" was directed at him,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missinfo.tv/index.php/history-of-lil-wayne-pusha-t-beef/ |title=A History of Lil Wayne vs. Pusha-T Beef: From "Mr. Me Too" to the "F–k Pusha" Tweet |publisher=MissInfo.tv |date=May 24, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> and in 2012 Pusha T's "Exodus 23:1" song caused Lil Wayne to vent on [[Twitter]], later releasing a diss track titled "Goulish", in which he says "Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him / His head up his ass, I'mma have to head-butt him".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHl7TzHHOuI DJ MoonDawg & Pusha T talk Drake, BET Cypher, 2012 Good Music Album on 107.5 WGCI] YouTube.com</ref> Pusha T has called Wayne's diss track "horrible" and said he felt it did not deserve a response. Both men have downplayed the feud, with Wayne saying he is over it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2012/10/16/exclusive-pusha-t-admits-new-god-flow-was-directed-at-birdman-details-issues-with-lil-wayne-drake/ |title=Exclusive: Pusha T Admits "New God Flow" Was Directed At Birdman; Details Issues With Lil Wayne & Drake |publisher=Hip-Hop Wired |date=October 16, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Alexis |first=Nadeska |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1695657/pusha-t-new-god-flow-birdman-response.jhtml |title=Pusha T's 'New God Flow' Lyrics Aimed At Birdman - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=October 16, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> However, in September 2012, Pusha T appeared on the remix of [[Chief Keef]]'s [[I Don't Like]], where he accused Wayne of using [[ghostwriter]]s saying, "My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like", he has since confirmed that the line was a Wayne diss.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/757403|title=Kanye West - Don't Like.1 Lyrics|website=[[Genius (website)|Genius]]|access-date=September 2, 2019}}</ref> In late November 2012, Pusha T once again dissed Wayne and [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] on a [[Ludacris]] song titled "Mad Fo" from his ''#IDGAF'' mixtape. Pusha T later revealed his motivation for the verse: "Oh because it's a [[Swizz Beatz|Swizz]] beat. You got to blame Swizz.

===Drake===
{{see also|The Story of Adidon}}
After the release of Pusha T's song "Exodus 23:1" in 2012, [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] seemingly responded to Pusha on the intro to his 2013 album ''[[Nothing Was the Same]]'', calling Pusha T a "bench player acting like a starter". The two directed subliminal disses towards each other between 2012 and 2017 with Pusha T rapping on the song "H.G.T.V", "It's too far gone when the realest ain't real / I walk amongst the clouds, so your ceilings ain't real/ These niggas Call of Duty 'cause they killings ain't real / With a questionable pen so the feeling ain't real,"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/pusha-t-8-1188741|title=Hear Pusha T diss Drake in new song 'HGTV'|date=October 13, 2016|work=NME|access-date=May 30, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> with Drake later responding on the diss track "[[Two Birds, One Stone]]" questioning Pusha T's drug dealing past.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1337-the-drake-vs-pusha-t-beef-are-we-really-doing-this/|title=The Drake vs. Pusha T Beef: Are We Really Doing This? {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|date=October 24, 2016|language=en|access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref>

Pusha T further escalated the feud on the song "Infrared" from his 2018 album ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'', where he accused Drake of using a [[ghostwriter]]. Drake responded to the song less than one day later, releasing a track titled "[[Duppy Freestyle]]" where he insults both Pusha T and [[Kanye West]], accusing Pusha of being a fake drug dealer and claiming that he would boost sales of Pusha T's album just by dissing him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.consequenceofsound.net/2018/05/pusha-t-daytona-drake|title=Pusha-T reignites feud with Drake on Daytona track "Infrared"|date=May 25, 2018|access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/drake-shares-new-song-duppy-freestyle-listen/|title=Drake Disses Pusha-T and Kanye on New Song "Duppy Freestyle": Listen - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|date=May 25, 2018|access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/pusha-t-vs-drake-a-complete-history-news.51021.html|title=Pusha T Vs.

Dumile was born in London and moved to [[Long Island, New York]], at a young age. He began his career in 1988 as a member of [[KMD]], performing as '''Zev&nbsp;Love&nbsp;X'''. The group disbanded in 1993 after the death of member [[DJ Subroc]], Dumile's brother. After a hiatus, Dumile reemerged in the late 1990s. He began performing at [[open mic]] events while wearing a metal mask resembling that of the [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain [[Doctor Doom]], who is depicted on the cover of his 1999 debut solo album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]''. He adopted the MF Doom persona and rarely made unmasked public appearances thereafter.

Between 2003 and 2005, Dumile released four solo albums and three collaborative albums. In addition to the critically acclaimed ''[[Mm..Food]]'' (2004) under the MF Doom moniker, he released solo albums including one under the pseudonym '''King Geedorah''' and two as '''Viktor Vaughn'''. ''[[Madvillainy]]'' (2004), recorded with the producer [[Madlib]] under the name [[Madvillain]], is often cited as Dumile's ''[[magnum opus]]'' and is regarded as a landmark album in hip hop.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strauss |first=Matthew |date=December 31, 2020 |title=MF DOOM Dead at 49 |website=[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]] |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/mf-doom-dead-at-49/ |url-status=live |access-date=December 31, 2020 |archive-date=January 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210101051502/https://pitchfork.com/news/mf-doom-dead-at-49/}}</ref> In 2005, Dumile released ''[[The Mouse and the Mask]]'' with the producer [[Danger Mouse (music producer)|Danger Mouse]] as [[Danger Doom]].

Though he lived the majority of his life in the United States, Dumile never gained American citizenship. In 2010, he was denied reentry after returning from an international tour for his sixth and final solo album, ''[[Born Like This]]'' (2009). He relocated to London and, in his final years, worked mostly in collaboration with other artists, releasing albums with [[Jneiro Jarel]] (as [[JJ Doom]]), [[Bishop Nehru]] (''[[NehruvianDoom]]''), and [[Czarface]] (''[[Czarface Meets Metal Face]]'' and the posthumous ''[[Super What?]]''). Dumile died in 2020 from [[angioedema]] following a reaction to a [[ACE inhibitor|blood pressure medication]].

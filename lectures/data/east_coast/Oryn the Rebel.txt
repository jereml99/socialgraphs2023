== United Front Company ==
The United Front Company is a collection of creatives, musical and non-musical alike, and independently owned companies coming together to form a larger platform - The Artist Jumpoff. Together members of the UFC help one another to promote and earn revenue through their art by pooling their talent, skills, fans and knowledge. The common philosophy at the UFC is no contracts as the focus remains on the artistic aspect rather than the business one.

== Underground Heat ==
''[[Grandmaster Caz#Compilations|Underground Heat Vol 1]]'', a mixtape series bringing together underground rappers from across the country, included two of Oryn's songs alongside works by [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]] and [[Shock G]]. This collaboration was mixed and hosted by Grandmaster Caz.<ref name="datpiff.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/-Rarehiphopcom-Underground-Heat-Mixtape-Vol-I-mixtape.219350.html |title=Various Artists - Rarehiphop.com Underground Heat Mixtape: Vol I // Free Mixtape @ |website=Datpiff.com |date=April 13, 2011 |access-date=February 8, 2013}}</ref>

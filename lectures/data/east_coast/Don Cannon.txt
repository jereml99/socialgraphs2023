==Career==

Cannon, along with DJ Drama and DJ Sense, officially co-founded the Aphilliates Music Group (AMG) in Atlanta in 2003.<ref name="DJB2006">{{cite news | last=Zisook| first=Brian| title =Asylum Records Announces Partnership With Aphilliates Music Group| work =DJ Booth| date =11 November 2006| url =https://djbooth.net/features/asylum-records-announces-partnership| access-date =12 September 2019}}</ref> Cannon often produced tracks on DJ Drama's prominent mixtape series, ''Gangsta Grillz'', which featured artists like Jeezy, [[Lil Wayne]], [[Gucci Mane]], Ludacris, [[Fabolous]], [[T.I.]], and numerous others.<ref name="XXLBday"/><ref name="Boom"/><ref name="XXLGangsta">{{cite news | last=C.M.| first=Emmanuel| title =DJ Drama Walks Fans Through his 'Gangsta Grillz' Mixtape Series| work =XXL| date =30 June 2016| url =http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/06/dj-drama-walks-fans-through-his-gangsta-grillz-mixtape-series/| access-date =12 September 2019}}</ref>

Some of Cannon's most notable early production credits with Aphilliates included Jeezy's "[[Go Crazy (Young Jeezy song)|Go Crazy]]" featuring [[Jay-Z]], [[50 Cent]]'s "Man Down," and Ludacris' "Everybody Hates Chris." Cannon also helped develop mixtape series like Lil Wayne's ''[[Dedication 2|Dedication]]'', T.I. and [[P$C]]'s ''In da Streets'', and Jeezy's ''Trap or Die''.<ref name="DX2008">{{cite news | last=Burgess| first=Omar| title =DJ Don Cannon Leaves Aphilliates| work =HipHopDX| date =10 December 2008| url =https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.8234/title.dj-don-cannon-leaves-aphilliates#| access-date =12 September 2019}}</ref><ref name="DJB2016">{{cite news | last=Phillips| first=Yoh| title =A Producer In The Rough: The Sounds & Impact of Don Cannon| work =DJ Booth| date =8 August 2016| url =https://djbooth.net/features/2016-08-08-sounds-of-don-cannon| access-date =12 September 2019}}</ref> He would go on to co-host a show on Atlanta's [[WHTA]] and became a music director for the show ''Streets Iz Watchin'' on the [[Sirius XM Radio]] station, [[Shade 45]]. ''Good Day Atlanta'', the morning show on [[WAGA-TV|Atlanta's Fox affiliate]], also named him "Atlanta's Best DJ."<ref name="Zilla"/><ref name="THR2013">{{cite news | title =Don Cannon Named VP of A&R at Def Jam| work =The Hollywood Reporter| date =8 July 2013| url =https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/don-cannon-named-vp-a-581712| access-date =12 September 2019}}</ref>

In September 2006, the Aphilliates Music Group entered into a strategic partnership with [[Asylum Records]].<ref name="DJB2006"/> In January 2007, however, Aphilliates' Atlanta offices were raided by local police at the behest of the [[RIAA]], and Cannon and DJ Drama were arrested on [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] charges. Authorities seized 81,000 mixtapes and various pieces of recording equipment in the raid.<ref name="BillRaid">{{cite magazine | last=Crosley| first=Hillary| title =DJ Drama Arrested In Mixtape Raid| magazine =Billboard| date =17 January 2007| url =https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1055916/dj-drama-arrested-in-mixtape-raid| access-date =12 September 2019}}</ref><ref name="NYTRaid">{{cite news | last=Sanneh| first=Kelefa| title =With Arrest of DJ Drama, the Law Takes Aim at Mixtapes| newspaper =The New York Times| date =18 January 2007| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/arts/music/18dram.html| access-date =12 September 2019}}</ref>

That raid and others like it were subject to public outcry in the aftermath, with some music industry insiders describing the RIAA and its constituent members as "schizophrenic." Aphilliates had largely operated with the express permission of major record labels at the time, because AMG helped promote their artists.<ref name="Mashed">{{cite book | last =Sinnreich | first =Aram | title =Mashed Up: Music, Technology, and the Rise of Configurable Culture | publisher =University of Massachusetts Press | date =21 July 2010 | pages =1–3 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=xCRfQMhIVpEC&q=%22don+cannon%22&pg=PA1 | isbn =978-1558498297 }}</ref> Neither Cannon nor DJ Drama were ever convicted in relation to the raid.<ref name="MTVRaid">{{cite news | last=Love| first=Tirhakah| title =How Hip-Hop Survived The Atlanta Mixtape Raid| publisher =MTV| date =18 January 2017| url =http://www.mtv.com/news/2973327/atlanta-mixtape-raid/| access-date =12 September 2019}}</ref><ref name="XXLRaid">{{cite news | last=Seabrook III| first=Robby| title =DJ Drama Arrested in Atlanta Mixtape Raid – Today in Hip-Hop| work =XXL| date =16 January 2018| url =http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/today-in-hip-hop-dj-drama-arrested-atlanta-mixtape-raid/| access-date =12 September 2019}}</ref>

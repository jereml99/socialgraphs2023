== Early life ==
Michael Williams was born on September 23, 1998 in [[Brooklyn, New York]] to a [[Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Trinidadian]] mother and [[Haitians|Haitian]] father.<ref name="pitchfork" /> He was raised in the [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] section of Brooklyn. He was influenced and inspired to rap by listening to [[The Notorious B.I.G.|B.I.G.]] and [[Drill music|Chicago drill]] rappers like [[Lil Bibby]] and [[Chief Keef]].<ref name="xxlmag">{{Cite web |last=Seabrook |first=Robby |date=February 12, 2020 |title=The Break Presents: Sheff G |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/sheff-g-interview-the-break/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809111311/https://www.xxlmag.com/sheff-g-interview-the-break/ |archive-date=August 9, 2020 |access-date=September 15, 2020 |website=XXL Mag}}</ref>

Before getting into music, Sheff G joined the 83 (Eight Trey) Gangsta Crips at age 12, and was imprisoned for 2 years for a felony [[gun charge]]. In 2015, he went back to prison for robbery for two years. Williams was released from prison in 2017. When asked about his childhood before rap, Williams said: "Growing up, all I was around was violence, in school, or hanging with my niggas, it was rough in the streets. I had to be protected out there, so I rolled with the 83s, we was in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] especially on my block, I was a block baby you heard like niggas kno my body. I would never think rapping would be n my future. I remember in 2014, at 15, we {{sic|was}} growing up watching [[GS9]] the G-Stone Crips get big, and they from the 90s on the East side, and I would be like 'damn, imagine I'm like that.' But it was a dream then."

== Legal controversy ==
In high school, Williams was arrested and went on probation after firing gunshots at Brooklyn’s Kings Plaza.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Holmes |first=Charles |date=October 20, 2019 |title=Rolling Loud and the NYPD Pulled 5 Rappers From the Festival.

One week before he turned 16, in 2014, he was arrested for the first time and booked in for fighting.

On November 19, 2015, Williams was incarcerated for one year and four months in jail for a felony gun charge and robbery. Williams also stated the last time he was incarcerated was in October 2017 to January 2018, a brief stint which he explains was the reason for his break on music.

On July 15, 2021, Williams was arrested in [[New York City]], New York for second-degree gun possession. His bail was remanded, meaning he sat behind bars until his court hearing on August 18, 2021. He pleaded guilty on October 20, 2021, and was sentenced to two years in prison. He is currently serving his sentence at Bare Hill Correctional Facility.

==Musical career==
Music became an outlet for Siya to comprehend and deal with the things she was exposed to and was feeling. After moving to Atlanta to pursue her music career in her mid 20s she built a rep and fan base for herself and caught the attention of well known artists and major labels. Siya faced a lot of obstacles throughout her early time in the industry due to her being one of the first openly gay female rappers. While some people in the industry were afraid of how an openly gay female rapper would fit into the genre, Siya remained determined and refused to compromise who she was and stayed true to her own voice and style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/lesbian-rapper-siya-comes-to-your-tv-on-reality-show-about-women-rappers-240838/|title=Lesbian Rapper Siya Comes to Your TV on Reality Show about Women Rappers|date=June 9, 2014|website=Autostraddle|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kitschmix.com/siya-mainstream-lesbian-rapper-youve-looking/|title=SIYA is the Mainstream Lesbian Rapper You've Been Looking For|date=October 23, 2014|website=KitschMix|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/av4a98/out-comes-the-lesbian-rap-ballad-456|title=Lesbian Hip-Hop Hits Prime Time|last=Schwartzberg|first=Lauren|date=October 9, 2014|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>

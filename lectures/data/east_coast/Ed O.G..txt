'''Edward Anderson''' (born November 27,<ref>{{cite tweet|user=edogboston|author=Edo.G|number=273407013487251456|date=27 November 2012|title=Today is My B-Day Happy Born Day to Me Another Year Another Blessed to B here! I'm Thankful}}</ref> 1970) is a [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] artist from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], better known by his stage name '''Edo G'''. Edo is the seniormost hip-hop artist from Boston (if not from anywhere in Massachusetts), in the sense that he was the first to gain recognition in [[New York City]] and in the wider [[United States of America]], and remains one of the best-known Boston rap artist internationally, having collaborated with large numbers of independent rap artists all over the globe. He is additionally known by the name '''Ed O.G.''', which was initially a misspelling by a record label but has endured.

==Career==
Edward Anderson was born in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]]—a working class, predominantly black neighborhood in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. His first [[stage name]] was Ed Rock, and started his career in the late 1980s at age 15, in a crew called F.T.I. – Fresh To Impress. They had a song called  "Suzi Q" on the "Boston Goes Def!" vinyl LP compilation, which was released in 1986.<ref>[https://thesource.com/2017/09/11/flashback-edo-g-on-meeting-guru-of-gang-starr/ Flashback: Edo. G On Meeting Guru of Gang Starr], The Source, retrieved 2017-09-11</ref> Three years later, with the help of New York's Awesome 2 duo (Teddy Ted and Special K) formed Ed O.G and Da Bulldogs in late 1989. He released his first album in 1991 with his group Da Bulldogs, titled ''Life of a Kid in the Ghetto''.<ref name="Kellman">Kellman, Andy "[http://www.allmusic.com/album/life-of-a-kid-in-the-ghetto-r27804/review ''Life of a Kid in the Ghetto'' Review]", [[AllMusic]], retrieved 2011-06-24</ref> The album included the song "Be a Father to Your Child," which received [[airplay]] on local Boston radio stations, and "I Got To Have It", which was sampled later by [[Mary J. Blige]] on the track "[[Ooh!]]". The group was dropped from [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] Records in 1993.<ref name="Conaway">Conaway, Matt "[http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-truth-hurts-r523492/review ''The Truth Hurts'' Review]", [[AllMusic]], retrieved 2011-06-24</ref>

Edo G. has subsequently gone on to release four solo [[album]]s and two [[Extended play|EP]]s, toured around the world, and worked with other artists including [[Pete Rock]], [[DJ Premier]], [[RZA]], [[KRS-One]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Black Thought]] of [[The Roots]] and [[Masta Ace]].

On his [[solo album]] ''The Truth Hurts'', he combined with DJ Premier and Pete Rock; "Wishful Thinking" was a [[sequel]] of his first solo performance. The connection with Rock turned into a [[partnership]] for the album ''My Own Worst Enemy''. One of the album's songs, "Wishing" (featuring Masta Ace), was featured on ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' in episode 9, Return of the King.

In 2005, Edo G. started a new group called [[Special Teamz]] with fellow Boston rappers Jaysaun (of Kreators) and [[Slaine (rapper)|Slaine]] (of [[La Coka Nostra]]). They released a [[mixtape]] on November 11, 2005, entitled ''The Mixtape''. Special Teamz released the album, ''Stereotypez'', on September 25, 2007, which featured production from Pete Rock, DJ Premier, and specialist [[Record producer|producer]] [[Marco Polo (producer)|Marco Polo]], who had previously collaborated with [[Jake One]] and [[Ill Bill]].  Appearances on the album included [[Buckshot (rapper)|Buckshot]] and [[Sean Price]] of [[Boot Camp Clik]], [[Ill Bill]], [[Akrobatik]] and [[Devin the Dude]].

Edo G. proceeded to work on a new album with Masta Ace. The first single, titled "Little Young" was released via [[Myspace]]. The album was scheduled for release in October 2009, but the release was delayed by a cease-and-desist order from [[A&E Television Networks]], which required a complete revision of the album cover artwork and design, due to copyright issues, as Edo and Masta Ace called their duo "A&E".

Edo G. is also a member of the Boston hip hop group 4Peace along with Twice Thou, [[Wyatt Jackson]], and DQuest.

In 2013, Edo G and OhNo collaborated on the song "Done Talking".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-03-06 |title=Edo G. x Oh No - "Done Talking" [Official Video] |url=https://www.okayplayer.com/news/edo-g-oh-no-done-talking-official-video.html |access-date=2022-06-15 |website=Okayplayer |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life, formation of the Wu-Tang Clan===
Russell Tyrone Jones was born on November 15, 1968, in the [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn|Fort Greene]] section of [[Brooklyn]], New York City.<ref name="Vice">{{cite web|author=Zachary Schwartz|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvqkam/ten-years-later-after-his-death-new-yorkers-still-love-ol-dirty-bastard-456|title=Ten Years After His Death, New Yorkers Still Love Ol' Dirty Bastard|date=2014-11-10|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref> He and his cousins [[RZA|Robert Diggs]] and [[GZA|Gary Grice]] shared a taste for rap music and martial arts-style movies.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Jones, Diggs, and Grice (later known as Ol' Dirty Bastard, RZA, and GZA respectively) formed the group Force of the Imperial Master, which became known as All in Together Now after their successful underground single of the same name. They eventually added six more members to their group, calling it the Wu-Tang Clan. The group released their debut album ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'' in 1993, receiving notable commercial and critical success.

===Music career===
Ol' Dirty Bastard's solo career began March 28, 1995, at the age of 26. His first solo album, ''[[Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version]]'', spawned the hit singles "[[Brooklyn Zoo (song)|Brooklyn Zoo]]" and "[[Shimmy Shimmy Ya]]", which helped propel the album to [[Music recording certification|platinum status]].  The album's sound was noted by several music writers as being as "raw and gritty" as ''36 Chambers'', with RZA and [[4th Disciple]] producing beats of an even more minimalist and stripped-down style than on the group's debut album. In this same year, Ol' Dirty Bastard collaborated with [[Mariah Carey]] for the remix version of her single "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)#Remixes|Fantasy]]".

It was around this time that Ol' Dirty Bastard gained notoriety when, as he was being profiled for an [[MTV]] biography, he took two of his three children by [[limousine]] to a New York State welfare office to cash a $375 welfare check and receive [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]<ref name="foodstamps">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrvnLpLjTuA Ol Dirty Bastard Pickin Up Food Stamps In A Limo] YouTube. Retrieved November 23, 2014.</ref> while his latest album was still in the top 10 of the US charts. The entire incident was filmed by an MTV camera crew and was broadcast nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ol' Dirty Bastard Gets Paid |url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/101194/ol-dirty-bastard-gets-paid.jhtml |publisher=MTV |access-date=April 4, 2013 |year=1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |magazine=CMJ New Music Monthly |title=Space Baby Jesus |date=January 2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wikEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39 |author=Joseph Patel |access-date=May 15, 2015}}</ref> Although he had recently received a $45,000 cash advance for his first solo album and was earning a cut of the profits from the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, Ol' Dirty Bastard was still listed as eligible for welfare and food stamps due to the fact that he had not yet filed his taxes for the current year. His caseworker revoked his eligibility after seeing the MTV segment, and the incident was presented by critics of [[welfare]] as representative of the allegedly widespread [[welfare fraud|abuse and fraud]] that led to the significant [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reforms enacted in 1996]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Kathy Gilsinan |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/wu-tang-forever-ol-dirty-bastards-role-in-american-welfare-reform/382679 |title=Wu-Tang Forever: Ol' Dirty Bastard's Role in American Welfare Reform |website=The Atlantic |date=November 13, 2014 |access-date=May 22, 2015}}</ref>

In 1997, Ol' Dirty Bastard appeared on the Wu-Tang Clan's second and most commercially successful work, the double album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]''. He had fewer appearances on this album than the group's debut, contributing to one solo track ("Dog Shit"), three verses ("Maria", "Reunited", "Heaterz"), one hook ("As High as Wu-Tang Get"), and a spoken introduction/refrain ("[[Triumph (song)|Triumph]]").{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In February 1998, Ol' Dirty Bastard witnessed a car accident from the window of his [[Brooklyn]] recording studio. He and a friend ran to the accident scene and organized about a dozen onlookers, who assisted in lifting the 1996 [[Ford Mustang]]—rescuing a 4-year-old girl from the wreckage. She was taken to a hospital with first and second-degree [[burn]]s. Using a [[Pseudonym|false name]], Ol' Dirty Bastard visited the girl in the hospital frequently until he was spotted by members of the media.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1429494/ol-dirty-bastard-saves-child/ |title=Ol' Dirty Bastard Saves Child |website=MTV.com |date=February 24, 1998 |access-date=March 1, 2010}}</ref>

The evening following the traffic accident, Ol' Dirty Bastard rushed on-stage unexpectedly as [[Shawn Colvin]] took the stage to give her acceptance speech for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] at the [[40th Annual Grammy Awards|1998 Grammy Awards]], and he announced he had recently purchased expensive clothes in anticipation of winning the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album]] that he lost to [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]]. As Ol' Dirty Bastard took the stage to a round of applause, he asked the audience, "Please calm down, the music and everything. It's nice that I went and bought me an outfit today that costed a lot of money today, you know what I mean? 'Cause I figured that Wu-Tang was gonna win. I don't know how you all see it, but when it comes to the children, Wu-Tang is for the children. We teach the children. You know what I mean? Puffy is good, but Wu-Tang is the best. Okay? I want you all to know that this is ODB, and I love you all. Peace!" The incident was widely covered in the media.<ref name=Time13>{{cite magazine |title=Grammy Gold – The Bastard Interrupts the Show |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1877498_1877438_1877442,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209100400/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1877498_1877438_1877442,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 9, 2009 |magazine=Time |access-date=April 4, 2013 |date=February 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/03/the-40-biggest-hip-hop-moments-in-pop-culture-history/odb-wu-tang-is-for-children |title=Ol' Dirty Bastard Explains Who Wu-Tang is For – The 40 Biggest Hip-Hop Moments in Pop Culture History |website=Complex |date=March 26, 2013 |author=Foster Kamer |access-date=May 17, 2015}}</ref> The morning after the Grammy Awards, he appeared on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', to discuss the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anfPXUrmqPY |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/anfPXUrmqPY| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|title=Ol' Dirty Bastard on Why He Stormed the Stage After Losing at the Grammys (1998)|date=July 23, 2018|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In 1999, Ol' Dirty Bastard wrote and recorded his second studio album, ''[[Nigga Please]]'', between jail sentences. The album received notable commercial success, although it failed to parallel the critical praise of his debut. This release included the single "[[Got Your Money]]", which garnered worldwide chart success. The song was produced by [[The Neptunes]] and featured chorus vocals by [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Kelis]].

In 1999, Ol' Dirty Bastard was paid $30,000 to appear on [[Insane Clown Posse]]'s fifth studio album, ''[[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]]''. Completing his track in two days, his recording consisted of his "rambling about bitches". Insane Clown Posse re-recorded the track and re-edited Ol' Dirty Bastard's vocals in order to form four rhymes out of his rambling, titling the song "Bitches".<ref>{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |author-link=Violent J |author2=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/414 414]–433 |chapter=Big Money Hustlas}}</ref>

In 2001, with Ol' Dirty Bastard again in jail for [[crack cocaine]] possession, his record label [[Elektra Records]] made the decision to release a greatest hits album (despite there being only two albums in his back catalog) in order to both end their contract with the artist ([[Ol' Dirty Bastard#Legal issues|see below section]]), and to profit from the publicity generated by his legal troubles. After the contract with Elektra was terminated, the label D-3 Records released the album ''[[The Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones]]'' in 2002, composed of tracks compiled without Ol' Dirty Bastard's input.

In 2003, the day he was released from prison, Ol' Dirty Bastard signed a contract with [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. Living at his mother's home under [[house arrest]] and with a court-ordered [[probation]], he used his criminal record to title his [[VH1]] special, ''Inside Out: Ol' Dirty Bastard on Parole''. He also managed to record his third album ''[[A Son Unique]]'', which was originally scheduled to be released through [[Damon Dash|Dame Dash Music Group]] in 2004; as of 2020, however, the album has never been released. In October 2004, one month before his death, his last collaboration was with [[Jon B.]] on the track "Everytime" from the album, ''[[Stronger Everyday]]''. In 2005, five months after his death, he appeared posthumously on the song "Blah-Blah-Blah" by [[Brooke Valentine]] on her debut album, ''[[Chain Letter (album)|Chain Letter]]''.

On July 17, 2004, Ol' Dirty Bastard had his second to last live performance at the [[Rock the Bells]] hip-hop festival in [[San Bernardino, California]], with the rest of the Wu-Tang Clan.

On July 18, 2004, his final live performance was at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] in [[Garrettsville, Ohio]].

In August 2017 in an interview on [[WQHT|Hot 97]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]] member [[RZA]] confirmed that the new Wu-Tang album, ''[[The Saga Continues (Wu-Tang Clan album)|The Saga Continues]]'', will contain unreleased vocals by Ol' Dirty Bastard.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ambrosiaforheads.com/2017/08/rza-confirms-unreleased-odb-music-new-wu-tang-clan-album-video/ |title=RZA Confirms There Will Be Unreleased ODB Vocals On The New Wu-Tang Clan Album (Video) |newspaper=Ambrosia for Heads |publisher=ambrosiaforheads.com |date=August 31, 2017 |access-date=September 2, 2017}}</ref>

To celebrate Ol' Dirty Bastard's birthday, "Intoxicated" from the unreleased album ''A Son Unique'' was released as a single on November 15, 2018.<ref>{{Citation|last=WuTangClanVEVO|title=Intoxicated (feat.

In July 1998, only days after being shot in a push-in robbery at his girlfriend's house in Brooklyn, he was arrested for [[shoplifting]] a pair of $50 shoes from a Sneaker Stadium store in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], although he was carrying close to $500 in cash at the time. He was issued [[bench warrant]]s by the Virginia Beach Sheriff's Department to stand trial after he failed to appear in court numerous times. He was arrested for [[Intimidation|criminal threatening]] after a series of confrontations in [[Los Angeles]] a few weeks later, and was then re-arrested for similar charges not long after that.  During a traffic stop, the details of which remain clouded in multiple versions of events, he was arrested for [[attempted murder]] and [[Criminal possession of a weapon|criminal weapon possession]].<ref name=vice /> The case was later dismissed.<ref>{{cite news |title=8 Explosive Finds in Wu-Tang Clan Member Ol' Dirty Bastard's FBI Files|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/8-explosive-finds-in-wu-tang-clan-member-ol-dirty-bastards-fbi-files?ref=scroll|access-date=January 13, 2012 }}</ref>

In October 2000, he escaped from his court-mandated [[Drug rehabilitation|drug treatment facility]] and spent one month as a fugitive. During his time on the run, he met with RZA and spent some time in their recording studio. He then appeared onstage at the [[Hammerstein Ballroom]] in New York drinking from a bottle at the record release party for ''[[The W]]'', the third Wu-Tang Clan album. In late November 2000, while still a fugitive, he was arrested outside a [[South Philadelphia]] [[McDonald's]] (at 29th and Gray's Ferry Ave.), after he drew a crowd while signing autographs. He spent several days in a [[Philadelphia]] jail and was later extradited to New York City. A [[Manhattan]] court sentenced him to two to four years incarceration.

Mourning the decline of Jones' mental and physical health, RZA wrote in his 2009 book ''[[The Tao of Wu]]'':<blockquote>Trust me, the man who became ODB, Ason Unique, my cousin, he was a scientist and a minor prophet... People may not know this from the outrageous character he played, but ODB was a visionary. But he decayed, he lost that vision... From the time they put him in jail to all the drugs he was doing to all the stress he went through with his family, it took away his ability to see. And this night, he sat there and looked me in the eye and said, "RZA, I don't understand." ... Now, I know that right there, right when he said that—we lost him. Eight hours later, ODB was gone.<ref>RZA, ''The Tao of Wu''. New York: Riverhead Books, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-59448-885-6}}.</ref></blockquote>

==Career==
After the duo Pete Rock & CL Smooth split in 1995, [[Pete Rock]] produced (and [[remix]]ed) tracks for dozens of other acts and released instrumental solo albums, while CL Smooth remained musically inactive.

Since their split, the two managed to reconcile their differences only long enough to record five tracks over the course of ten years, namely "Da Two," "Back On Da Block," "Fly 'Til I Die," "Appreciate," and "It's A Love Thing." In 2004, there was talk of a reunion and a new album. This, however, was thwarted by another fallout.

During this period, CL Smooth mostly declined to appear on other artists' albums, with the exception of "Only the Strong Survive" with [[DJ Krush]] in 1996.

Starting around the year 2006, CL Smooth began making guest appearances slightly more frequently. Among the artists to whose songs he has contributed guest vocals are [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]] ("Magic Hour"), [[Raekwon]] (“Silk”, also featuring [[Sauce Money]]), [[Nujabes]] ("Sky Is Falling"), [[JR Writer]] (the remix of "Mesmerize"), and [http://www.discogs.com/Supafuh-Just-Act/release/2873827 Supafuh] ("Act of Faith"). As of 2022, his most recent guest appearance was on the song “The Masters” by the [[Canadian hip hop|Canadian]] rapper-producer duo of [[Ghettosocks]] and DK.

CL Smooth released his debut solo album, ''[[American Me (album)|American Me]]'', in 2006. To promote the album, Shaman Work released a promotional mixtape compiled by DJ J Period called ''Man On Fire'' in late April 2006, featuring 36 minutes of [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]]s and a remixed version of the track "Impossible". He was also featured on the [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]] album ''[[The Return of the Magnificent]]'' on the track "All I Know," which was also featured in the video game [[NBA Live 08]]. Around the same time, he released a single called “Perfect Timing”, featuring [[Skyzoo]].

In October 2010 Smooth and Pete Rock headlined the Clean Energy Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cleanenergytour.com/|title=Clean Energy Tour|work=cleanenergytour.com}}</ref>  The tour had six shows all over [[California]], and focused on voter mobilization leading up to the November 2010 midterm elections. CL
Smooth has developed an interest in, and become an activist in opposition to, [[climate change]]. He was a vocal opponent of [[Proposition 23]].<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy1ho4UrJEQ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211219/Wy1ho4UrJEQ |archive-date=2021-12-19 |url-status=live|title=C.L.

In February 2019, CL Smooth released a single entitled "Just In Town", featuring and produced by Fleezy E and Wayno Da Producer for Da Watchmen.

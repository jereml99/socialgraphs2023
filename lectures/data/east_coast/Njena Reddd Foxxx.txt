{{Quote box
 |quote  = "[Reddd Foxxx] was given to me by Ojay on the night we recorded "Ima Read" -- it kind of just stuck. I think I loved it so much because I really love the comedian [[Redd Foxx]] a lot... There's a lot of what I love about his comedy in my work. That sort of crude humor is very similar to my own. I spelled it that way because I like everything to be symmetrical in groups of three. So, each name has five letters."

Brown's lyrics have been described to be "raunchy" and "over-the-top" with "skimpy clothes to match."<ref>{{cite magazine| title=Writers Look Back on Foxy Brown & Lil Kim's Powerful Debuts 20 Years Later: They Were 'Milestones in Hip-Hop'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7572692/lil-kim-hard-core-foxy-brown-ill-na-na-anniversary|last=Rosario|first=Richy|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> Her music is often centred around themes such as "fashion, sex, and the mafia" and is described as "intriguingly seductive" and having "a contemporary edge with a sleek and sexy soundscape."<ref name="FoxyUdiscover">{{cite web|title=Foxy Brown|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=February 27, 2020 |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/foxy-brown/}}</ref> Her work for her debut album was described as "a heroine straight from the pages of a James Bond novel," selling over a million copies with the support of major male artists such as Nas and AZ.<ref name="FoxyUdiscover" /> Brown's voice has been described as a "husky flow" with "dancehall swagger".<ref name="highsnob" />

Although her work was compared to rapper [[Lil' Kim]], ''[[Highsnobiety]]'' writer David Opie said that,
<blockquote><p>Just because they were both the 'First Ladies' of their respective crews, doesn't mean that Foxy or Kim were identical by any means, and it was hugely misogynistic to suggest otherwise [...] In an industry that still actively mocks vulnerability and weakness, [[hip hop music|hip hop]] needs more rappers who are willing to open up in this way, and the fact that Foxy did so such a long time ago speaks volumes about her artistry.<ref name="highsnob" /></p></blockquote>

== Impact ==
Brown's impact on the rap world has often been overlooked due to her legal run-ins, but it has been noted that "she's bright, talented, sexy and, most important, she's not afraid to take risks creatively" and that her "impact still stands."<ref>{{cite web |title=Foxy Brown Is Still On Our Fashion Moodboards |last=White |first=Brooklyn |url=https://www.essence.com/fashion/foxy-brown-fashion/#496577 |access-date=April 29, 2020}}</ref><ref name="highsnob" /> Her albums have been cited to harness "a winning formula of looping R&B songs into hip-hop hits, resulting in the genre-shifting record," [[Ill Na Na]].<ref>{{cite web |title='Ill Na Na': How Foxy Brown's Debut Album Changed The Game For Women in Hip-Hop |last=Grove |first=Rashad |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/foxy-brown-ill-na-na/ |access-date=April 29, 2020}}</ref> The release of her album marked a monumental moment in hip-hop history, but was downplayed due to comparisons between her and rapper, Lil' Kim and although Foxy may not have achieved the "iconic status" Kim had reached, "her debut album was an essential part of a turning point in mainstream rap music."<ref>{{cite web |title=How 'Hard Core' and 'Ill Na Na' changed the game for women in rap.|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2016/02/lil-kim-foxy-brown-debut-albums-female-mcs|last=Lindsey|first=Treva.

It was just a reassurance to me as a hip-hop head that this space might be opening up for women in a way that has never been done before.

Cited as a [[fashion design|fashion icon]], ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' writer Janelle Harris wrote that Brown celebrated "the beauty of her mahogany skin as the self-professed 'dark-skinned Christian Dior poster girl,' boasted about being 'dripped in [[Gabbana]] [...] starring in billboards as big as the pride of the Black girls who saw themselves in her likeness."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a41621/lil-kim-foxy-brown-fashion/|title=20 Years After Their Debuts, Lil' Kim And Foxy Brown's Style Still Feels Revolutionary|access-date=November 2, 2020|website=Elle|last=Harris|first=Janelle|date=December 27, 2016 }}</ref>

Described as one of the "illest to ever do it – regardless of gender," Scott Glaysher of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' noted that "If those aforementioned male rappers epitomize the menacing New York City mobster of the late 90s then Foxy represents the mob wife that is even more sinister with weaponized sexuality." He stated that "the sheer confidence and astute rhyming Foxy brought to ''[[Ill Na Na]]'', makes it one of the 90s most memorable albums and a catalyst for the fierce feminine rap wave that followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.4255/title.the-20-best-rap-albums-of-all-time-from-artists-who-just-happen-to-be-women|title=The 20 Best Rap Albums Of All Time ...

On September 7, 2007, [[New York City Criminal Court]] Judge Melissa Jackson sentenced Brown to one year in jail for violating her [[probation]] that stemmed from a fight in 2004 with two manicurists in a New York City [[nail salon]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Foxy Brown Sentenced To A Year In Jail|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/foxy-brown-sentenced-to-a-year-in-jail-1049428/|magazine=Billboard|agency=Associated Press|date=September 7, 2007|access-date=September 7, 2007}}</ref> On September 12, representatives of the rapper disputed claims by her lawyer that she was pregnant.<ref name="Jailed Foxy Brown 'not pregnant'">{{cite news|title=Jailed Foxy Brown 'not pregnant'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6992526.stm|work=BBC News|date=September 13, 2007|access-date=February 24, 2008}}</ref> On October 23, 2007, Brown was given 76 days in [[solitary confinement]] due to a physical altercation that took place on October 3, with another prisoner.

If convicted, she faced up to seven years' imprisonment.<ref name="Nydailynews.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/foxy-brown-pleads-not-guilty-violating-order-protection-exposing-arlene-raymond-article-1.442298|title=Foxy Brown pleads not guilty to violating order of protection, exposing herself to Arlene Raymond |work=New York Daily News |date=July 22, 2010 |access-date=August 5, 2011 |location=New York}}</ref> On July 12, 2011, the charges were dropped.<ref name="Gorta">{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/over_the_moon_SCyPM3BdEW3ufx0m5KlvzJ | work=New York Post | first=William J. | last=Gorta|title=Over the moon!|date=July 13, 2011|access-date=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

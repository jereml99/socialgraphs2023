Its lead single is "Away", which is an opening and introductory song about his family and troubled childhood.  Mike raps, "Promised my Pop I wouldn’t cry a tear / but sometimes I get so tired, Goodyear / name the last time I had a good year with no dysfunction / guess it’s my curse conjunction / to stay in this pain of world I know / got so much pain I got to let it show/but I can’t live like this I got to let it go".

A [[Music video|video]] has been shot by the productive team Creative Control for "Away", who have also produced for [[Kanye West]], [[Erykah Badu]], and [[Currensy|Curren$y]].

'''Gabriel Jackson''' (born May 27, 1963), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Spoonie Gee''', is one of the earliest [[Rap music|rap]] artists, and one of the few to have released rap records in the 1970s. He has been credited with originating the term [[hip hop]]{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} and some of the themes in his music were precursors of [[gangsta rap]].

== Career ==
Jackson was born in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]], receiving his 'Spoonie' nickname as a child because the spoon was the only utensil that he used to eat with.<ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin (1999) ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music'', Virgin Books, pp. 322–23. {{ISBN|0-7535-0252-6}}</ref><ref name="Shapiro">Shapiro, Peter (2005) ''The Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', Rough Guides, pp. 344–45. {{ISBN|1-84353-263-8}}</ref> His mother died when he was twelve years old, and he went to live with his uncle, the record producer [[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]], in whose apartment he began to practice rapping.<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name="Shapiro" /><ref name="Toop">Toop, David (1984) ''The Rap Attack: African Jive to New York Hip Hop'', Pluto. {{ISBN|978-0-86104-777-2}}</ref>

His first recording came about after Peter Brown visited Robinson's record store and mentioned that he was looking to make a rap record.<ref name="Toop" /> Spoonie's name was suggested, and he recorded "Spoonin' Rap", which was released on Brown's Sound of New York, USA imprint, featuring a lyric that included jailhouse references that would later become common in gangsta rap, and with echo applied to his vocals.<ref name="Pierson" /> Spoonie Gee has been described as "the original gangsta rapper".<ref name="Leland89">[[John Leland (journalist)|Leland, John]] (1989) "[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/12/arts/recordings-rap-as-public-forum-on-matters-of-life-and-death.html?pagewanted=1 RECORDINGS; Rap as Public Forum on Matters of Life and Death]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 12 March 1989. retrieved 2010-03-28</ref><ref name="Leland90">Leland, John (1990) "[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/77388041.html?dids=77388041:77388041&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+26%2C+1990&author=BY+JOHN+LELAND&pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&desc=HIP+HOP+FOR+BEGINNERS+A+Parents%27+Guide+to+What%27s+Dookie+and+Fly HIP HOP FOR BEGINNERS A Parents' Guide to What's Dookie and Fly]", ''[[Newsday]]'', 26 August 1990. retrieved 2010-03-28</ref>

He then recorded for Robinson's [[Enjoy Records|Enjoy! Records]]; his first release for the label being the similarly minimalistic "Love Rap" (on which he was accompanied on [[conga]]s by his brother Pooche Costello), issued on the B-side of the [[Treacherous Three]]'s "New Rap Language" (on which he also featured), leading to his early nickname of 'The Love Rapper'.<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name="Pierson">Pierson, Richard "[{{AllMusic |class=artist |id=p79370/biography| pure_url=yes}} Spoonie Gee Biography]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved 2010-03-28</ref> Jackson was a founding member of the [[Treacherous Three]], along with [[L.A. Sunshine]] and [[Kool Moe Dee]]. Although the group added [[Special K (artist)|Special K]] as a member when Jackson left to record his first single, Gee maintained ties and affiliation with the group, and also played a hand in the group getting their first record deal. The group was named Spoonie Gee and the Treacherous Three when Jackson returned for a period before going solo.<ref>Fricke, Jim; Ahearn, Charlie (2002). ''Yes Yes Y'all: the Experience Music Project Oral History of Hip-Hop's First Decade''. [[Experience Music Project]]. p. 265.</ref>

He left Enjoy! and moved to [[Sugar Hill Records (hip hop label)|Sugar Hill Records]], where he enjoyed further hits with "Spoonie's Back" and the collaboration with [[the Sequence]] on "Monster Jam".<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name="Pierson" /> In 1985, he moved on again to Aaron Fuchs' [[Tuff City Records|Tuff City]] label, on which the majority of his later output was issued, including "That's My Style", on which he attacked [[Schoolly D]] for copying his style.<ref name="Shapiro" /> By the mid-1980s, he was also working in a rehabilitation centre for people with learning disabilities.<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name="Toop" /> His career took off once again in 1987 with his debut album ''The Godfather of Rap'', produced by [[Marley Marl]] and [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]], and issued on the Tuff City label.<ref name="Larkin" /> His career has since been hampered by several spells in prison.<ref name="Shapiro" />

In the mid-1990s, a compilation of his work, ''Godfather of Hip Hop'', was issued on the Ol' Skool Flava label. In the mid-2000s, he returned with a new [[Extended play|EP]], ''The Boss Is Back''.<ref name="Pierson" />

In 2008, "Love Rap" was ranked number 65 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.<ref>"[http://stereogum.com/archives/vh1s-100-greatest-hiphop-songs_024391.html VH1’s 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs]", Stereogum.com. retrieved 2010-03-28</ref>

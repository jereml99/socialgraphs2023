==Life and career==
===1986–2005: Early life===
Oladipo Omishore is from the [[Brooklyn]] borough of [[New York City]]. He is of [[Nigeria]]n heritage, of the Yoruba tribe.<ref name="naij">{{cite news |author=Bodunrin |first=Sola |date=March 17, 2016 |title=American singer Jhene Aiko is married to Yoruba man |work=[[Naij]] |publisher= |url=https://www.naij.com/767914-amazing-popular-american-singer-speaks-yoruba.html |url-status=live |access-date=March 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401152935/https://www.naij.com/767914-amazing-popular-american-singer-speaks-yoruba.html |archive-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name="net">{{Cite news |author=Atisele |first=Kenneth |date=March 17, 2016 |title=While We Weren't Looking, Jhene Aiko Got Married To A Yoruba/American Producer |work=[[Nigerian Entertainment Today]] |publisher= |url=http://thenet.ng/2016/03/while-we-werent-looking-jhene-aiko-got-married-to-a-yorubaamerican-producer/ |url-status=dead |access-date=March 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319025319/http://thenet.ng/2016/03/while-we-werent-looking-jhene-aiko-got-married-to-a-yorubaamerican-producer/ |archive-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref> His parents always encouraged his interest in music, and at the age of seven, his father sent him to the Brooklyn Music School for [[piano]] lessons, where he studied with Tom Coote. Omishore preferred playing the guitar, but learning how to play a [[keyboard instrument]] was very beneficial later in life when he started producing. He attended [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University]] in New York, where he studied [[electrical engineering]] and graduated in 2009.<ref name="sound" />

===2006–2009: Career beginnings and producing for Kid Cudi===
Omishore began his career in sound-mixing in 2003 at New York University by using [[Image-Line]]'s [[FL Studio]] program. In 2004, Omishore created a studio in his basement with equipment bought by his parents and would later call it "Head Banga Muzik Studios."<ref>{{Cite web |title=About |url=http://headbangamuzik.com/about/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224063906/http://headbangamuzik.com/about/ |archive-date=February 24, 2012 |access-date=September 7, 2012 |website=Head Banga Muzik}}</ref> After gaining attention for his production, he decided to change locations to the Brewery Recording Studio. In May 2009, Da Genius partnered up with Andrew Krivonos, owner of Brewery Recording Studio, and helped move the studio to North Brooklyn in a new facility.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Studio |url=http://breweryrecording.com/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002023410/http://www.breweryrecording.com/studio/ |archive-date=October 2, 2012 |access-date=December 22, 2021 |website=Brewery Recording Studio}}</ref>

Omishore and [[Kid Cudi]] met in 2006, and they lived together for two years. Both artists found a genuine liking for one another, and chose to work with each other on several music productions. "Day N' Nite" turned out to be the biggest hit production that both of them worked on together, with Omishore providing the beats and Cudi rapping and singing over the music. He produced the song in Head Banga Muzik Studios, and used several different methods of mixing and synthesizing the beats on this track. The song took a total of two days to complete, from the [[instrumental]] being made to the track's final arrangements. No edits were made after that two-day process ended. It was finished in 2007 and became popular two years later, in 2009.<ref name="sound" />
"Day N' Nite" reached the top three in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="sound" /> It was released under the labels [[GOOD Music]], [[Fool's Gold Records]], [[Universal Motown Records]], and [[Data Records]]. It is featured on the album ''[[Man on the Moon: The End of Day]]''.

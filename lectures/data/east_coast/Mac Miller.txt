Miller began his career in Pittsburgh's [[hip hop]] scene in 2007, at the age of fifteen. In 2010, he signed a record deal with independent label [[Rostrum Records]] and released his breakthrough [[mixtape]]s ''[[K.I.D.S. (mixtape)|K.I.D.S.]]'' (2010) and ''[[Best Day Ever (mixtape)|Best Day Ever]]'' (2011). Miller's debut studio album, ''[[Blue Slide Park]]'' (2011), became the first independently distributed debut album to top the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] since 1995.

In 2013, he founded the record label imprint REMember Music. After his second studio album, ''[[Watching Movies with the Sound Off]]'' (2013), he left Rostrum and signed with the major label [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 2014. With them, he released four studio albums: ''[[GO:OD AM]]'' (2015), ''[[The Divine Feminine]]'' (2016), ''[[Swimming (Mac Miller album)|Swimming]]'' (2018), and the posthumous ''[[Circles (Mac Miller album)|Circles]]'' (2020). For ''Swimming'', he was posthumously nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album]].

In August 2023, [[Ariana Grande]] marked the 10th anniversary of her debut album by launching a special edition of her 2013 popular track "[[The Way]]." This fresh rendition, titled "Live from London," includes the initial vocals of her song's collaborator, Mac Miller. Notably, Miller's vocals intertwine with Ariana Grande's as she performs the song. This holds significance as Grande performs the song live, both with and without Miller's vocals (Grande sometimes performed the song without Mac Miller's vocals before his death) for the first time since Miller's unfortunate passing in 2018.

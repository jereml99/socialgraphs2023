==Biography==
===Early career===
Easy Mo Bee was born in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], and raised in the neighborhood's Lafayette Gardens projects.<ref>Fernando Jr., S. H. (2021). ''From the Streets of Shaolin: The Wu-Tang Saga''. Hachette Books. ch. 6. {{ISBN|0-30687-444-X}}.</ref> He began producing after hearing music by [[Ced Gee]] of [[Ultramagnetic MCs]] and [[Marley Marl]], producer of early hip-hop hits for the [[Juice Crew]] and [[LL Cool J]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nodfactor.com/2009/07/14/2332 |title=Back Tracking With Easy Mo Bee |website=Nodfactor |date=July 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120100415/http://www.nodfactor.com/2009/07/14/2332 |archive-date=November 20, 2009 |access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref> His first production placement came on Big Daddy Kane's breakthrough album, ''[[It's a Big Daddy Thing]]'', after which he was approached to work with another [[Cold Chillin' Records]] artist, The Genius — an early alias for [[Wu-Tang Clan]] co-founder [[GZA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cratekings.com/easy-mo-bee-on-producing-miles-davis-early-wu-tang-big-daddy-kane/ |title=Easy Mo Bee On Producing Miles Davis, Early Wu-Tang, Big Daddy Kane |publisher=Cratekings.com |date=2009-04-13 |access-date=2011-11-23}}</ref> Mo Bee produced the majority of the rapper's debut album, ''[[Words from the Genius|Words From the Genius]]'', as well as produced "Sexcapades", a track that featured on the B-side of fellow future Wu-Tang co-founder [[RZA]]'s first single, "[[Ooh I Love You Rakeem]]", which the rapper/producer released under the alias Prince Rakeem.<ref>{{cite web|title=Easy Mo Bee|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/59872-Easy-Mo-Bee?filter_anv=0&subtype=Production&type=Credits|website=Discogs|publisher=[[Discogs]]|access-date=16 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Around that same time, Mo Bee had a group with neighborhood friends A.B. Money and J.R. called '''Rappin' Is Fundamental'''.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Dana|title=Easy Mo Bee Traces Ice Cube & Big Daddy Kane's Influence On Biggie's "Ready To Die"|url=http://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.2565/title.easy-mo-bee-traces-ice-cube-big-daddy-kanes-influence-on-biggies-ready-to-die|website=hiphopdx.com|date=13 September 2014 |publisher=Cheri Media|access-date=2015-02-10}}</ref>  The trio released only one album on [[A&M Records]] in 1991: ''The Doo-Hop Legacy''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rappin' Is Fundamental: The Doo Hop Legacy|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rappin-is-fundamental-the-doo-hop-legacy-mw0000266885|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2016-02-10}}</ref> Jazz pioneer [[Miles Davis]] approached the young producer to help fuse jazz and hip-hop. These sessions would become his last studio album, 1992's ''[[Doo-Bop]]''. The project, released posthumously after Davis died during the recording process, leaving the project unfinished, garnered generally mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelastmiles.com/interviews-easy-mo-bee.php |title=Easy Mo Bee: Interviews: The Last Miles: The Music Of Miles Davis 1980 - 1991: A book by George Cole |website=Thelastmiles.com|access-date=2011-11-23}}</ref>

=== 1990s ===
Mo Bee first linked up with [[Sean Combs]]' [[Bad Boy Entertainment]] in 1993, when he produced the first single for Combs' up-and-coming artist, the [[Notorious B.I.G.]], "Party and Bullshit".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/easy-mo-bee-mn0000167944/credits|title=Easy Mo Bee – Credits|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2021-11-06}}</ref> Easy also went on to produce much of the label's two flagship releases: ''[[Project Funk Da World|Project: Funk da World]]'' by [[Craig Mack]], and ''[[Ready to Die]]'' by B.I.G.<ref name="allmusic"/> Additionally, Mo Bee produced the "Flava in Ya Ear (Remix)," a driving single for both projects, featuring Craig Mack, Biggie, [[Busta Rhymes]], Rampage and [[LL Cool J]].<ref name="allmusic"/>

In 1994 and 1995, Mo Bee was also associated with [[2Pac]], having produced songs for both, including one called "[[Runnin' (From tha Police)|Runnin' From tha Police]]," featuring both Pac and B.I.G. as well as rapper/producer Stretch and 2Pac's crew [[Dramacydal]].<ref name="allmusic"/> In addition to featuring 2Pac and B.I.G. on the same record, the song is notable for inventive production techniques he described in an interview with ''[[HipHopDX]]''. "There’s a bassline in the original version. Go back and listen to that record. I played the bassline live all the way through that record from the [[E-mu SP-1200|SP-1200]] through multi-pitch. It was like a bass guitar strumming, and if I messed up, it was like 'Yo bring it back, and plug me in.'"<ref name=":0" />

Mo Bee went on to produce two songs for Pac's 1995 album ''[[Me Against the World]]'',<ref name="allmusic"/> although the two recorded several other songs that did not make the cut.<ref name="allhiphop">{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/features/archive/2010/01/30/22112209.aspx |title=Easy Mo Bee: Talks Eminem Beef and Producing For Pac and B.I.G. |publisher=AllHipHop.com |date=2010-01-30 |access-date=2011-11-23}}</ref> During this time period, he also crafted moderate radio hits for the [[Lost Boyz]] ("Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz & Benz"); [[Das EFX]] ("Microphone Master"); and [[Busta Rhymes]] ("Everything Remains Raw").<ref name="allmusic"/>

=== Later career ===
In 1997, Mo Bee produced for Biggie's double-disc album, ''[[Life After Death]]''. The producer crafted two songs, "I Love the Dough" and "[[Going Back to Cali (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Going Back to Cali]]";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=405 |title=The Making of Life After Death: Many Men |publisher=Xxlmag.com |access-date=2011-11-23}}</ref> these songs would mark the last time Easy would produce for Bad Boy.

In 2000, he put out an album called ''Now or Never: Oddysey 2000'', featuring East Coast staples [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Raekwon]], [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]], [[Smif-N-Wessun]], [[Kool G Rap]], and [[Sauce Money]], along with [[Goodie Mob]] and [[Kurupt]]. Over the next decade he would craft songs for [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Ras Kass]], the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Mos Def]], [[Black Rob]], [[Sean Price]], [[Wiz Khalifa]] and others, eventually winning a Grammy for his work with [[Alicia Keys]] on her album, ''[[The Diary of Alicia Keys]]'' (2003).<ref name="allhiphop"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Alicia Keys |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/the-diary-of-alicia-keys |title=The Diary of Alicia Keys: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |access-date=2011-11-23}}</ref>

==Early life==
Earl Simmons was born on December 18, 1970, in Mount Vernon, New York.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/rapper-dmx-dead/2021/04/09/89509a0e-9618-11eb-962b-78c1d8228819_story.html | title=DMX, chart-topping rapper with gruff voice and hardscrabble life, dies at 50 | first=Harrison | last=Smith | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=April 9, 2021}}</ref> He was the son of 19-year-old Arnett Simmons and 18-year-old Joe Barker.<ref>{{cite news | last=Jiménez | first=Jesus | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/04/arts/dmx-hospitalized.html | title=DMX on Life Support in 'Vegetative State,' Ex-Manager Says | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 4, 2021}}</ref> Earl was Simmons' second child; she had given birth to a daughter, Bonita, two years prior, and later gave birth to one daughter, Shayla, and two stillborn sons.<ref name=earl/> His father, Barker, was an artist who painted [[watercolor painting]]s of street scenes to sell at local fairs. Barker moved to Philadelphia and was largely absent from his life.<ref name=agony>{{Cite news | url=https://www.gq.com/story/dmx-obituary | title=DMX Turned Agony and Atomic Energy Into One of Rap's Most Titanic Legacies | first=JEFF |last=WEISS | work=[[GQ]] | date=April 10, 2021}}</ref>

As a child, Simmons suffered greatly from bronchial asthma, being taken to the emergency room almost nightly due to him waking up unable to breathe.<ref name=earl/><ref name=agony/> He was raised as a [[Jehovah's Witness]] but became disillusioned with the faith after an incident where he was hit by a drunk driver while crossing the street. A month later, an insurance representative went to his house to try and reach an agreement to prevent his family from suing. Simmons claims he was told that his family could have been awarded a settlement of $10,000 and possibly even more for the injuries he sustained. However, his mother rejected the settlement as she claimed that Jehovah's Witnesses are taught to be self-sufficient, although the group's official doctrine at the time did not prohibit suing or receiving settlements.<ref name=earl/>

Simmons went through a disjointed childhood that included being beaten by his mother and her various boyfriends so badly that he lost teeth and sustained numerous bruises and cuts on his face. When Simmons was five years old, his family settled into the School Street Projects in
Yonkers, New York.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.revolt.tv/2021/4/10/22377095/city-of-yonkers-honor-dmx|title=City of Yonkers to honor DMX|first=Christopher|last=Harris|date=April 10, 2021|website=REVOLT}}</ref> When he was six years old, his mother knocked out two of his teeth with a broom after he erased something in her notebook.<ref name=earl/> At school, he threw chairs at teachers and stabbed another child in the face with a pencil.<ref name=agony/> When he was seven, an aunt got him drunk on vodka. The same year, he was jailed for stealing cakes from a market.<ref name=agony/> One summer, his mother locked him in his bedroom, allowing him to only exit for trips to the bathroom.<ref name=agony/> At the end of the fifth grade, at age 10, Simmons was expelled from school and sent to the Julia Dyckman Andrus Children's Home for 18 months. X states that he actually enjoyed it there at first. He got 3 good meals with a dessert every day, an allowance every week, colored TV's and stereo's he could use, and occasional vacations. Also for Christmas the school gave each child $25. Every so often, Earl would receive visits from his family which he described as his favorite times. They would go out on the lawn and play frisbee, sleigh ride when it was snowy and just socialise.<ref name=earl/> Earl and a kid he met at the group home decided to experiment like kids do. They wanted to see if they lit a blue flame to the basement floor, would the floor turn blue. he was charged with arson, after this he and the kid (Adam) started fighting a lot and it became a major problem. X attempted to choke him to death one day and was taken from the normal school population and had to stay in an unused office during school hours. He also had to move out of his cottage and live in the infirmary.<ref name=earl/> Constantly away from other children, from going and playing outside, and enjoying all the other privileges. Later, Earl was sent to Children's Village. In what he described as a defining moment of betrayal, his mother tricked him by telling him they were just visiting the home, then she enrolled him there.<ref name=agony/><ref name=earl/>

When he was 14, Earl returned to Yonkers. Simmons began living between the streets, his grandmas and couch surfing at a friend's house. This had been regular for X since he was a young child, even sleeping in [[Salvation Army]] clothing bins a few times. At a young age he began to feel a connection to dogs, and started befriending stray dogs and even stealing dogs.<ref name=agony/><ref name=earl/><ref name=song>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/slippin-played-court-rapper-dmx-gets-year-prison-tax-evasion-n861121 |title=DMX song played in court before rapper gets a year in prison for tax evasion | first=Elizabeth | last=Chuck | work=[[NBC News]] | date=March 29, 2018}}</ref>
During his time in group homes he had started beatboxing and became very engaged with Hip Hop.
After performing for his friends, they encouraged Simmons to continue writing music at the behest of his teacher. When he returned home, Simmons met Ready Ron, a local rapper, who was impressed with Simmons' beatboxing skills and asked him to become his partner. Simmons chose the name "DMX", which came from an instrument he had used at the boys' home, the [[Oberheim DMX]] [[drum machine]]. It later was also interpreted as "Divine Master Of The Unknown" and "Dark Man X".<ref name=earl/><ref name=song/>

As a freshman at [[Yonkers Middle High School]], DMX was the second-fastest on the track-and-field varsity team. However, he had bad grades and a sparse attendance record.<ref name=agony/> He turned to robbery as a way of making money to eat and buy clothes, jewellery and stuff for his dog: his first was a purse [[snatch theft]] in Yonkers that netted him $1,000 ({{Inflation|US|1000|1984|fmt=eq|r=-2}}), which he used to buy a leather dog collar and dog harness for his dog, and a pair of [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]] boots for himself.<ref name=earl/> After celebrating a friends birthday, X hit a blunt handed to him by Ready Ron. It was laced with crack, shortly after Earl had build up a strong addiction to crack. By the end of the year, he attended school just to rob people and was robbing three people per day to fund his addiction for crack.<ref name=earl/> He also started [[carjacking]].<ref name=agony/> X was locked up for a few months for stealing a dog. Later after being released went to school with a shotgun strapped to his leg one day to commit a robbery, and a few days later was arrested again and sentenced to 2 years at Industry Institution in upstate New York.<ref name=earl/> The juvenile prison was a low security unit slightly south of Rochester, and if you were heading anywhere but north was completely in the middle of nowhere. 2 days in Earl and his cellmate, a white kid from an upstate town escaped. They walked 3 days in the snow to the town Earl's cellmate lived in. They stayed in the basement of a friends house, and there his accomplice left Earl by himself. Earl was found by the family and they fed him and let him stay until they gave him money to get home for his birthday.<ref name=earl/>

In 1988 while Earl was in the Hamptons with a friend that he drove in a stolen car, he was arrested and his "friend" snitched on him giving police all the information they needed. He was sent to Suffolk County Jail where he battled other inmates, namely [[K-Solo]].<ref name=earl/>

==Musical career==
===1985–1995: Career beginnings===
DMX got his start in performing at age 14, in 1985, when he beatboxed for Ready Ron. They would do small shows together where Ready Ron would control the mic as the Emcee, and DMX would beatbox and adlib for Ron. After a while he came to a realization that the Rapper was always the person getting all of the attention, so he decided to start rapping himself. Going by the name "DMX", meaning "Divine Master Of The Unknown" and later "Darkman X".<ref name=earl/> After serving a 2-year prison sentence, he began writing his own lyrics and performing at the local recreation center for younger children. In 1988, while in prison for carjacking, he began dedicating almost all of his free time to writing lyrics and battling other inmates.<ref name=earl/> During this time he had created a style called "Spellbound" where he spelled each word out letter by letter. While in Suffolk County Jail he met up and coming rapper [[K-Solo]] and they engaged in a battle.<ref name=earl/> X claims to have used the spellbound style to defeat him, and [[K-Solo]] claims to have created and used the spellbound style to win against DMX. After the battle they gained respect for each over and became friends. DMX was released in 1988, but spent majority of 1989 locked up as well. Upon being released in late 1989, he began producing and selling his own mixtapes where he rapped over instrumentals from other songs and sold them on street corners, which helped him build a local fan base all over Yonkers. At the time he was working with a Yonkers DJ called DJ Kasun.<ref name=earl/>

In 1990 shortly after DMX's release from prison, [[K-Solo]] released his single "Spellbound". From here DMX felt as if K-Solo had stolen his style and began making tracks dissing him and putting them on mixtapes.<ref name=earl/> In 1990 his DJ, Kasun was locked up and another local DJ named Superior became DMX's main DJ and close friend.<ref name=earl/> X began going all around New York performing at shows, battling over rappers and selling his mixtapes. In November 1990 DMX battled Bill Blass at School 12, Yonkers. This makes the audio on YouTube potentially the oldest recording of DMX. They eventually rematched the next year.<ref name=earl/> Around this time X was being managed by Jack McNasty, and had created a demo tape produced by House Party Productions.<ref name=earl/> The demo tape consisted of the tracks "Spellbound", "Critical Condition", "Unstoppable Force", "Three Little Pigs" and "The Original Author Of Spellbound" (a diss track dedicated to K-Solo). He made his first radio appearance in December 1990 on WBLS, where he was interviewed and spit his Spellbound style live a cappella.<ref name=earl/> Currently going by "DMX The Great", he made an appearance on ''[[The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show]]'' in January 1991 with Percee P, where they both freestyled.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://randomrapradio.com/2017/07/07/dj-stretch-armstrong-show-feat-bobbito-1990-1991-feat-percee-p-dmx-freestyle-remastered/ | title=DJ Stretch Armstrong Show feat Bobbito &#91;1990 & 1991&#93; Feat Percee P & DMX Freestyle &#91;REMASTERED&#93; | date=July 7, 2017 }}</ref> the same month, ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine praised DMX in its ''Unsigned Hype'' column that highlighted unsigned hip-hop artists.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2021/04/dmxs-legacy-in-12-songs.html | title=DMX's legacy in 12 songs | first=Troy L. | last=Smith | work=[[Cleveland.com]] | date=April 9, 2021}}</ref> DMX continued to put out mixtapes, and in 1992 under "Ruff Ryders Ent." he put out his first single "Born Loser/Catching The Same Hell" independently. Later this year [[Columbia Records]] signed DMX to its subsidiary label [[Ruffhouse Records]], which released his major debut single "Born Loser" in 1993.<ref name=yahoodmx>{{Cite news | title=Rapper DMX is dead at 50, family confirms | url=https://news.yahoo.com/rapper-dmx-dead-50-family-162500096.html |last=Pendleton |first=Tonya | work=[[Yahoo!]] |date=April 9, 2021}}</ref> After the single didn't achieve as much success as expected due to poor promotion, X finished his contract with Ruffhouse and was now an independent artist.<ref name=earl/>

In January 1994 [[Death Row Records]] had approached Ruff Ryders to sign DMX. They came to Powerhouse Studios in Yonkers after [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Tha Dogg Pound]] had finished a show in New York. X spit for them and they were impressed with what they heard, the next week they flew Ruff Ryders out to Los Angeles to finalise signing DMX. Eventually they decided not to sign to Death Row since they couldn't reach the right agreement.<ref name=earl/> During 1993 and 1994 X was staying in Baltimore with Waah Dean, Darin "Dee" Dean and the rest of the original Ruff Ryders. One night X took a cab all the way from Baltimore to The Bronx to battle Jay Z. Both sides claim to have won, with the final result being decided as a draw.<ref name=earl/> Later this year he independently released his single, "Make a Move" with "Cant Touch Me Kid" as the B-Side. He also recorded another single "Up To No Good", produced by SpunkBigga. A music video was even shot for the song, filmed in Mulford Gardens, Yonkers where DMX lived, and 125th in Harlem, Manhattan. For unknown reasons the song was never released. He made his first guest appearance alongside [[Jay-Z]], [[Ja Rule]], and [[Mic Geronimo]] on the classic underground track "Time to Build" on Mic Geronimo's debut album.<ref name=earl/> In late 1994 DMX was sentenced to around a year of prison time for criminal possession of a weapon, and did his time in Valhalla Correctional Facility.<ref name=earl/> He was released around late 1995, and began featuring on songs with Pudgee Tha Phat Bastard, Cash Money Click, Black Child and [[Jay Z]].

===1996–1997: Building hype, coming close to death and signing to Def Jam===
During 1995 and 1996 DMX would spend a lot of time putting together mixtapes with DJs such as Superior, Crazy Rob and Steve Black. Around this time fellow Ruff Ryder's [[The Lox]] were signed to [[Bad Boy Records]], and had Harlem producer [[Dame Grease]] create a large percentage of their beats. Eventually after a while of trying to convince him, Waah Dean signed [[Dame Grease]] as a producer for Ruff Ryders. Waah and Darin "Dee" Dean approached [[Sean Combs]] in the interest of getting DMX a deal, but Puffy claimed that DMX was not marketable enough.<ref name=earl/> DMX started making tracks with production by [[Dame Grease]] and PK, including a classic unreleased single called "Deeper".<ref name=earl/> Around this time DMX started to feel very pessimistic, and was under the impression that he would never succeed in the rap game.<ref name=earl/> However, in the summer of 1996 one of the songs DMX, [[The Lox]] and [[Mase]] had recorded, "Niggaz Done Started Something" became a mixtape/street hit. It was featured on [[DJ Clue]]'s "Summatyme Shootout Pt.1 (1996)" mixtape, DJ S&S's "Bad Boy Vol. IV, Stop Yappin' (1996)" mixtape to name a couple. This song alone gave DMX a huge buzz, and later in November 1996 DMX made his first major mixtape exclusive appearance with the "Ghetto Life" freestyle on Ron G's "Street Dreams (1996)" mixtape.<ref name=earl/>

DMX was really starting to build up some hype in the streets, however one night in December 1996 X was brutally jumped and almost died. Earlier that evening he had picked up a chain he saw someone drop during a police chase, and was wearing a [[Avirex]] jacket he had stolen from someone's back yard weeks earlier.<ref name=earl/> While hanging out around "Slow bomb" projects, DMX was told people were looking for him believing that he had robbed a 16 year old for both the jacket and chain. DMX did not rob the kid, however the chain he took was robbed from the kid before X took it himself. He agreed to meet them, and explain to them he did not commit the robbery and was willing to hand over the possessions.<ref name=earl/> DMX met the father, uncles and multiple other people with the child who were looking for him in an alley way and handed them the jacket and chain, DMX tried to explain the situation but the kid persisted that DMX was indeed the person who robbed him. Suddenly, X was grabbed and the father began to punch him to the ground with the whole group brutally punching and stomping him out without any restraint.<ref name=earl/> after a while of the group stomping him out they began to drag him into a nearby park on Locust Hill, with other people on the street even joining in after hearing the false news that DMX had robbed a child. After minutes more of beating him the group began to leave him lying almost lifeless in the park, when one of the men started walking back with a brick to launch it at DMX's head.<ref name=earl/> Earl's survival instinct kicked in and he mustered all the strength in his body and managed to stumble away with the brick missing him. DMX described this as revenge for everyone he had ever robbed, and a lesson given to him by god.<ref name=earl/> An ambulance found him lying in a pile of blood a block away from the scene of the beating, he was taken to Yonkers General Hospital where he was sent home with the doctors claiming he hadn't broke anything and that he would be fine. 2 days later his throat had swelled up so much that he could barely breathe so Tashera Simmons took him to Valhalla Correctional Facility's hospital, where DMX's uncle was a Correctional Officer.<ref name=earl/> The doctors claimed that if he did not come to the hospital that day, that he would have died. They did an X-Ray on him and found that he had broken his jaw in multiple places and had many serious injuries. For 4 months DMX had his jaw wired, and had to eat only liquid food through a straw.<ref name=earl/>

Shortly before this event DMX's associate [[Irv Gotti]] became an A&R for [[Def Jam Recordings]], and was telling DMX that [[Def Jam Recordings]] co-president [[Lyor Cohen]] was willing to come to Powerhouse Studios in Yonkers to hear DMX and other local rappers in Yonkers.<ref name=earl/> DMX claimed he didn't care when even if his jaw was indeed wired and he couldn't even speak properly, so the next night Lyor came to Powerhouse. DMX spit his best material and performed for almost an hour, with the maximum intensity, passion and emotion even with his jaw being wired shut. Lyor jumped up in the air amazed by DMX's performance and decided to sign DMX to [[Def Jam Recordings]].<ref name=earl/>

===1998-2000: Debut album and commercial success===
In March–April 1997, DMX had the wires taken out of his mouth. The same day he and [[The Lox]] recorded the famous "Get At Me Dog Freestyle" for [[DJ Clue]]'s "Clueminatti: The New World Order" mixtape.<ref name=earl/> The beat and verse 3 from his unreleased single "Deeper" were used to later make his debut Def Jam single "Get At Me Dog". DMX recorded tracks from April 1997 to January 1998 for his debut album. During this time, his guest appearances on [[Mase]]'s singles "[[24 Hrs. to Live]]" and "Take What's Yours", [[D-Block (hip hop)|The LOX]]'s single "[[Money, Power & Respect (song)|Money, Power & Respect]]", and [[LL Cool J]]'s single "[[4, 3, 2, 1 (LL Cool J song)|4, 3, 2, 1]]" created a strong buzz for his up-and-coming album.<ref name="allmusic"/> In February 1998, he released his debut major-label single "[[Get at Me Dog]]" on [[Def Jam Recordings]].

During the 1990s, DMX formed a close bond with fellow up-and-coming rappers [[Jay-Z]] and [[Ja Rule]]. The three collaborated many times and formed a group known as [[Murder Inc.

When DMX partnered with [[Jay-Z]] and [[Ja Rule]] in Murder Inc., there was a feud between the two, which also contributed to the failure of the group and working together.

Later this year he was sentenced to 2 years for another crime and sent to Industry Institution (Now named OCFS-Industry Residential Center) in upstate New York.<ref name=earl/> However, in December 1986, just a few days after starting his sentence, he and his cellmate successfully escaped the prison and DMX returned home until his mother forced him to turn himself in and finish his sentence, which he did at the McCormick Juvenile Detention Centre in Brooktondale, New York.<ref name=earl/> Simmons was sent to prison again in 1988 for [[carjacking]], and was later moved to a higher security prison after attempting to extort a fellow inmate for drugs. He was released in the summer of 1988.<ref name=earl/>

=== 1989 ===
DMX was charged with fourth degree grand larceny (155.30) in January 1989 and served a 9-month sentence. (As shown in police report shown in BET's Ruff Ryders Chronicles documentary. No reference available to cite)

=== 1992 ===
DMX was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (220.03), no disposition reported

=== 1993 ===
During his time in Baltimore DMX <ref name=earl/> was charged for multiple crimes. The first being in March, with him being charged with criminal sale in the third degree of a controlled substance (220.39), no disposition reported. The second being criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (220.03), no disposition reported.

It's possible DMX also served time in late 1993 since he claim he is "fresh off a bid" in his 1994 track "Can't Touch Me Kid". This is just theory since there is no evidence to support this claim.

=== 1994-1995===
In late 1994 DMX was sentenced and charged with criminal possession of weapon and served around a year (the exact time served/sentenced is unknown) in Valhalla Correctional Facility. (As shown in police report shown in BET's Ruff Ryders Chronicles documentary. No reference available to cite) <ref name=earl/> (as shown in December 1994 prison letter from DMX in DJ Superiors "The Man Who Walked The Dog" book, No reference available to cite). On his third day there, he spat in the face of a captain and was sentenced to 1 year and 1 month of solitary confinement. He was put in Lockdown Block 3K <ref name=earl/> and sometime in late 1995 finished his sentence.

{{Quote box|"Throughout his nearly three-decade career, DMX came to embody passion, rawness, and pure emotional honesty like few hip-hop artists ever have, barking his way through hits like "[[Ruff Ryders' Anthem]]" and "[[Get at Me Dog]]" one moment, and repenting and philosophizing on tracks like "[[Slippin'|Slippin]]'" the next.

DMX's funeral ("DMX's Homegoing Celebration") took place in Brooklyn at the [[Christian Cultural Center]] on April 25, 2021. It was livestreamed on the [[BET Network]] and its YouTube channel. It lasted around five hours to a limited capacity of 2,000 people. DMX's casket was in the color red and featured the word "FAITH" in large printing. It was featured in the front of the room. People who were in attendance included Nas, [[Lil' Kim|Lil Kim]], [[Alicia Keys]] and Swizz Beatz as well as the pastor of the church, Reverend A.R. Bernard. [[Louis Farrakhan]], a leader of the [[Nation of Islam]], joined the service via Zoom. With the exception of Alicia Keys, Nas and Lil Kim, they all gave speeches. DMX's former wife, Tashera Simmons and Ruff Ryders founders Waah & Dee also gave a speech. There was some controversial testimonies like former [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] chief [[Lyor Cohen]], when his video featured an overhead view of a beach and explained how Earl Simmons was a wonderful man while DMX was a gremlin. Additionally, Def Jam cofounder [[Russell Simmons]] compared his own issues with drug abuse to DMX via video. The homegoing ended with DMX's obituary read on stage and a virtual performance from [[Faith Evans]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rose|first=Jordan|date=2021-04-25|title=DMX Funeral Features Moving Speeches From His Ex-Wife and Swizz Beatz|url=https://variety.com/2021/music/news/dmx-funeral-swizz-beatz-russell-simmons-1234960096/|access-date=2021-04-29|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref>

On August 17, 2009, Hamilton released ''This Perfect Life'' [[extended play|EP]] as promotion for the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://norimo.wordpress.com/2009/08/17/this-perfect-life-ep-charles-hamilton-mixtape/|title=This Perfect Life EP – Charles Hamilton [Mixtape]|date=August 17, 2009|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref>

When the cover ''for This Perfect Life'' was released, Hamilton caused some controversy when the deceased producer, [[J Dilla]], was named as executive producer.<ref>[http://allhiphop.com/stories/features/archive/2009/06/08/21651909.aspx Charles Hamilton Addresses J Dilla Love & Detroit Controversy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419005702/http://allhiphop.com/stories/features/archive/2009/06/08/21651909.aspx|date=April 19, 2011}}, http://allhiphop.com, Monday, June 8, 2009</ref> A handful of Dilla's closest associates through hip hop began speaking out against Hamilton's use of the name and its connection to his music. Hamilton later stated he wished to financially help [[J Dilla]]'s mother, who had [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]], the same illness that took [[J Dilla]]'s life. J Dilla's name was later removed from the album artwork due to legal reasons.<ref>[http://www.xxlmag.com/news/latest-headlines/2009/06/xxclusive-charles-hamilton-takes-j-dilla-credits-off-album-lp-drops-for-free-online-this-tuesday/ Charles Hamilton Takes J Dilla Credits Off Album], xxlmag.com, June 10, 2009</ref>

After months of speculation, the album was never released as a result of Hamilton getting dropped from [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] on September 19, 2009, for multiple reasons, including but not limited to his poor performance at a Penn State rap battle and his unapproved crediting of J Dilla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complexmag.ca/music/2012/12/the-30-worst-fall-offs-in-rap-history/charles-hamilton|title=Complex CA – Latest News in Canadian Pop Culture|website=Complexmag.ca|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref> Manager Le'Roy Benros later explained why he felt Hamilton's career stalled by telling [[HitQuarters]]:

==== Personal struggles and arrest ====
During an interview on July 27, 2010, Hamilton announced that he had checked himself into a [[psychiatric hospital]]. He stated: <blockquote>"My stay here is like identical to my stay in the industry. As far as being the new guy in here having to deal with politics and people trying to control you. The critics would have to be the doctors and the rounds. So you can say this is like an experiment to see if the industry is really like an asylum or if I was the one bugging. Some say the industry is like high school but its just like a [mental hospital]. All I wanted to do and still want to do is make music, he explained. It got to the point where I started talking in rhymes all the time, even in just regular conversations. And music just became me, so I thought it be a good idea if I checked into the hospital just to get my mind right."<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Hamilton Checks Into Mental Hospital|url=http://theboombox.com/charles-hamilton-checks-into-mental-hospital/|access-date=July 18, 2018|website=The Boombox|date=July 27, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=July 26, 2010|title=Charlie Hamilton In A Mental Institution Because Of The Music Industry?!?!|url=http://bossip.com/270450/bossip-exclusive-first-rapper-charles-hamilton-gets-punked-by-his-baby-mama-and-now-hes-in-a-mental-institution/|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>After being released on August 10, 2010, Hamilton discussed in an interview his stay at the psychiatric hospital and why upon filming of his release in a video why he was in a wheelchair, stating: "The reason Im in a wheelchair is because I have sharp pains since I was in the hospital and a little bit before, he said. I have sharp pains when Im walking and literally I want to collapse but I can't I have to continue to walk. So my right leg has been acting kinda funny. I still have a little bit of mobility, I can still stand up in the booth but I'd rather the mobility of my legs be jeopardized than my musicality be jeopardized at any given point of time."<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Hamilton Explains Mental Hospital Stay & Wheelchair on Channel Live – XXL|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2010/08/charles-hamilton-explains-mental-hospital-stay-wheelchair-on-channel-live/|access-date=July 18, 2018|website=XXL Mag|date=August 18, 2010 }}</ref>

Hamilton had just crashed his father's girlfriend's car, which he took without permission or a drivers license. Unharmed, he wandered to [[Quicken Loans Arena]] where he began playing what he says was an imaginary basketball with exiting [[Cleveland Cavaliers|Cavalier]] fans. "This cop walks over and was like, what are you doing?. I said, Basketball. He puts his arms out to guard me, so I crossed him and he slipped. His partner came over like, What's going on? He grabbed my arm and I punched him."<ref name="charleshamiltoninterview8">{{cite magazine|title=Rapper Charles Hamilton on His Struggle With Mental Illness: 'I Wanted to Commit Suicide' (Exclusive)|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6494579/rapper-charles-hamilton-on-his-struggle-with-mental-illness|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref>

Hamilton would later ultimately be diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]; during the time he was undiagnosed, he stated that "I just didn't trust anybody. I didn't leave my house, I just made music all the time. I was fighting depression – I shut myself in."<ref name="charleshamiltoninterview8" /> Hamilton would also discuss how in his early career before he started his recovery, that he wanted to commit suicide: "I wanted to commit career suicide, physical suicide, spiritual suicide, I didn't care anymore."<ref name="charleshamiltoninterview8" />

{{Main|Hamilton, Charles (album)}}
On October 16, 2014, Hamilton announced via his blog that he had finally started working on his debut studio album and that he would not be releasing any more free projects stating:
<blockquote>I got good news and bad news...
The good news is, I'm finally working on my debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, ''Vampire Sunlight'' might be the last free release, and ''The Evil Microchip'' will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for everyone who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and [[Dr. Dre|Dre]] to [[Jimmy Iovine]]. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely.

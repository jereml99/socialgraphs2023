== Biography ==
Elle Royal (formerly Patwa) was born in New York and raised in the Wakefield area of the Bronx, and later, Lawrenceville, Georgia. Both of her parents are from Kingston, Jamaica. Growing up, Elle lived in a multi-family home shared with many cousins, one of which had a studio in his home. It was here that Elle constructed her first rhyme at 14. From there, Elle began writing and recording music in a studio she built in her room. During High School, Elle self-recorded her first mixtape “One Gyal Army” and later released its first single “What Can I Say” in 2010.

=== Name change ===
Elle describes her career as Patwa as a time when she was making music for the intent of acquiring commercial success. As she grew older her desire to shed light on topics of importance grew also. It was her belief that females were losing their power and self-worth in a male-dominated society. In an effort to promote higher consciousness and self-esteem among women, Patwa changed her name to Elle Royal and her focus to inspire and empower females.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.tffmag.com/new-blog-1/2016/1/20/elle-royal|title=Elle Royal empowering women through music|work=TFF MAG|access-date=2017-08-09|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2015 she signed and collaborated with female singers, rappers, models and dancers under a new label she founded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cottenkandi.com/2013/11/26/rapper-patwa-says-rihanna-stole-her-doobie-wrap-hairstyle/|title=Rapper Patwa Says Rihanna Stole Her Doobie Wrap Hairstyle|date=2013-11-26|website=Cotten Kandi ™|access-date=2017-08-09}}</ref> She then changed her name to Elle Royal to reflect her new purpose of empowering women. As she explains, “Elle” comes from her first name, Danielle and “Royal” comes from “having the status of a King or Queen”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dancehallhiphop.com/2010/12/07/this-week-featured-talent-patwa/|title=This Week Featured Talent: Patwa|date=2010-12-07|website=Dancehall HipHop|access-date=2017-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiphoplead.com/tag/patwa/|title=Patwa|website=Hip Hop Lead|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-09}}</ref>

== Musical style and influences ==
Elle has always gravitated towards 90s hip-hop citing hip-hop's "Golden Era" as her favorite time in music. She also grew up influenced by 90s R&B and Reggae.

==DJing==
In the 1970s Hip Hop was first being pioneered. In [[The Bronx]] at [[block party|block parties]] it was the DJ's that were the primary artists, with the [[rapping|rappers]] being secondary. Mario put on many early shows in the Rosedale park, 'Big Park', in The Bronx.<ref name=hh>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopandpolitics.com/2001/08/15/pioneers-step-out-to-honor-disco-king-mario/|title=Pioneers Step Out to Honor Disco King Mario|date=15 August 2001|publisher=}}</ref> At this time Mario with his crew, known as Chuck Chuck City, played largely up-tempo [[disco]] music.<ref name="Chang" />

Mario's earlier sound system had been pieced together over years. Influenced by [[Kool DJ Dee]] and Tyrone the Mixologist he upgraded his sound system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sebadamani.com/blog/a-history-of-hip-hop-in-perspective2|title=A History of Hip Hop in Perspective|website=Seba Damani}}</ref><ref name="hist">{{cite web|last1=Agyekum|first1=Seba Kwesi Damani|title=A History of Hip Hop in Perspectiv|url=https://www.academia.edu/12545353|accessdate=17 November 2017}}</ref> He was known for the quality of his sound system.{{r|Hess}}

Mario and fellow hiphop pioneer Bambaataa were both members the [[Black Spades]] gang. The territory they controlled included most of the southeast Bronx.{{r|Chang}} DJs had to either get their permission before they could safely DJ publicly.

==Influence==
Disco King Mario never released any records.  His pioneering role in the genesis of Hip Hop did not lead to the nationwide celebrity as either a performer of a producer, which a number of other early rap and hip hop performers enjoyed.

[[Afrika Bambaataa]] started out as an assistant to Mario,{{r|Chang}} and Mario loaned Bambaataa the technical equipment for his first appearances as DJ, and Bambaataas first DJ-Battle took place in 1976 in the New York Junior High School 123 against Mario.<ref>Adaso, Henry "[http://rap.about.com/od/hiphop101/a/hiphoptimeline.htm Hip-Hop Timeline: 1925 - Present]", About.com, retrieved 2011-01-29</ref><ref name="Price">Price, Emmett George (2006) ''Hip Hop Culture'', ABC-CLIO Ltd, {{ISBN|978-1-85109-867-5}}, p. 109</ref> [[DJ Jazzy Jay]] had his first appearances as well with Mario.

Mario was also an influence on rapper [[Busy Bee Starski]], helping him to develop his voice.<ref name="Cooper">Copper, Barry Michael (2007) "[http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-09-11/music/bee-kind-rewind/ Bee Kind, Rewind]", ''[[Village Voice]]'', September 11, 2007, retrieved 2011-01-29</ref>

[[Busy Bee Starski]] referenced Mario on his 1988 track ''Old School'' from the album ''Running Thangs''.

[[Grandmaster Caz]] referenced Mario on his 2005 "untitled" song on grandgood records, released as a 7inch vinyl record.

==Memorials==
In Rosedale Park, The Bronx, where Mario once played in the 1970s he was honored by many hip-hop icons like Grand Master Melle Mel, Kurtis Blow and many female pioneers like Lisa Lee and many others.

In 2023, Rosedale Avenue was officially co-named Disco King Mario Way<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hip-hop icon 'Disco King Mario' honored with street co-naming as part genre's 50th birthday celebrations |url=https://bronx.news12.com/hip-hop-icon-disco-king-mario-honored-with-street-co-naming-as-part-genres-50th-birthday-celebrations |access-date=2023-09-16 |website=bronx.news12.com}}</ref> in honor of how the DJ sculpted Hip Hop prior to it going mainstream before 1973.

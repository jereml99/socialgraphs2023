== Career ==
[[File:Jamie Kennedy by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Jamie Kennedy, 2010]]
When Kennedy first arrived in [[Los Angeles]], he became a professional [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] extra.

After a few years of struggling, Kennedy was unable to find an agent and worked as a host at [[Red Lobster]]. He auditioned for over 80 commercials and could not book one. He then took a job as a [[Telemarketing|telemarketer]] and learned that he had a talent for selling things. Kennedy then thought that if he could sell anything, "why not sell myself?", becoming his own agent.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Kennedy created a false persona, screen agent "Marty Power", to attract the attention of real agents and managers over the phone, who would later book his performances. He came to prominence in the late 1990s for playing Randy Meeks in the [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' film series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3333303/interview-jamie-kennedy-talks-buddy-hutchins-tremors-5/ |title=Jamie Kennedy Talks 'Buddy Hutchins' and 'Tremors 5′ |publisher=BloodyDisgusting.com |date=April 27, 2010 |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> His lead role as Tim Avery in ''[[Son of the Mask]]'' earned him a [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actor]], he would later voice his experiences with the film on his YouTube channel in the later years after its release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://razzies.com/forum/topic668_page1.html |title=2005 RAZZIE Nominees & "Winners" |publisher=Razzies.com |access-date=March 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228195941/http://www.razzies.com/forum/topic668_page1.html |archive-date=February 28, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The film would also go on to inspire Kennedy to host the 2007 documentary ''[[Heckler (film)|Heckler]]'' after feeling hurt by the film's poor reception in which some reviewers attacked him personally.

Kennedy formed a production company called Wannabe Producers, alongside Josh {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} through which he has produced the shows ''[[The Jamie Kennedy Experiment]]'', ''[[Blowin' Up]]'', ''[[The Starlet]]'', and ''[[Living with Fran]]'' created by [[David Garrett (screen writer)|David Garrett]]. Following ''[[Malibu's Most Wanted]]'', in which he both wrote and starred, Kennedy co-wrote the [[MTV]] show ''[[Blowin' Up]]'' (2006) featuring his friend, [[Stuart Stone|Stu Stone]].

Kennedy lent his voice to the videogame ''[[ESPN NFL 2K5]]'' as a celebrity adversary with his own football team, the Upper Darby [[Cheesesteak]]s. He is also unlockable as a free agent tight end in season mode. His stint as [[Activision]]'s emcee at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] 2007, however, drew much criticism not only for his ignorance of the industry, but also for appearing to perform drunk as he insulted the audience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/07/19/watch-activision-alienate-E3-audience-with-jamie-kennedy/ |title=Watch Activision alienate E3 audience with Jamie Kennedy |publisher=Joystiq |date=July 19, 2007 |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> In a video uploaded to YouTube on June 14, 2021, Kennedy claimed that Activision had scrapped his script at the last minute and he was ad-libbing his jokes while suffering from [[occupational burnout|burnout]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Jamie |title=Jamie Kennedy Reacts to E3 TRAINWRECK |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMZgiPyoqwU |website=YouTube}}</ref>

While working on his film ''Malibu's Most Wanted'', Kennedy wrote an autobiography titled, ''Wannabe: A Hollywood Experiment''. The book chronicles his life in Hollywood as he attempts to become a star. It gives background on his life and family and quickly dives into his adventures. It tells of such things as Kennedy's living conditions in the Hollywood slums, his dilapidated car, and his kidney issues.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

A performer of [[stand-up comedy]], he is also known for his sketch performances on his television reality show, ''[[The Jamie Kennedy Experiment]]'', which became the [[The WB|WB Network]]'s highest-ranking new show in 2002, but which was cancelled in April 2004 due to falling viewership.<ref>[http://media.www.unewsonline.com/media/storage/paper953/news/2006/12/07/Entertainment/Jamie.Kennedy.Yuks.It.Up.Tonight.At.Slu-2527534.shtml Jamie Kennedy review]{{Dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In 2006, Jizzy Entertainment released ''[[Unwashed: The Stand-Up Special]].''

He also stars in [[Nicktoons]]' ''[[Fanboy & Chum Chum]]'' as Kyle, an insecure boy wizard who loathes the fun-loving Fanboy and Chum Chum, but who secretly yearns for their friendship.

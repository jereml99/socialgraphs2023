== Early life ==

He was introduced to hip-hop music at age sixteen by Justin Bieber. <ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Morrell|first=Dan|date=March 1, 2017|title=You've never heard of the rapper Token?

In his younger years, Goldberg was often sent home from school by his teachers because of this. Additionally, he had difficulty in understanding expressive language. Goldberg was eventually diagnosed with autism. As a child, Goldberg suffered from obesity, weighing nearly 240 pounds in the fourth grade. He began running on the treadmill after school and lost 50 pounds halfway through fifth grade as a result.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Citation|last=Uproxx Studios|title=Token, Child Rap Prodigy {{!}} Uncharted: The Power of Dreams|date=May 26, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKLE8eoelIE|language=en|access-date=January 16, 2022|archive-date=January 18, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220118183823/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKLE8eoelIE|url-status=live}}</ref>

At a young age, Goldberg had a dream of becoming a pop star; a psychiatrist noted that it seemed to be the only thing on his mind. An outlet for Goldberg was writing poetry in his diary, which eventually evolved into writing pop songs at the age of 17. According to Goldberg, the main artists he listened to were [[Justin Bieber]], [[Vanilla Ice]], and [[Limp Bizkit]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=C.M|first=Emmanuel|date=December 22, 2017|title=The Break Presents: Token – XXL|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/token-interview-the-break/|url-status=live|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|language=en|access-date=January 16, 2022|archive-date=March 17, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230317214631/https://www.xxlmag.com/token-interview-the-break/}}</ref>

== Career ==
=== 2012–2014: Career beginnings ===
Goldberg first began rhyming under the name BDG (his initials). He began uploading his content on [[YouTube]] after a childhood friend discovered music that he had recorded and encouraged him to create a channel to gain a following. His first song was a freestyle to "[[Party in the USA]]" by [[Miley Cyrus]]. The students at his school reacted negatively towards his work, but he began building a fanbase online.<ref name=":0" /> In the sixth grade, Goldberg started collaborating with his friend Colin Mitchell, a local emcee known as C-Mitch. Their first project was ''Lethal Combination''.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> While the reception from the public was generally negative as well, one of the duo's CDs ended up in the possession of producer Jon Glass, who saw their potential and became a mentor to them.

Goldberg later adopted the stage name Token, which came out of feeling different from other emcees  as a white Jewish kid from Salem. He started uploading his music videos through YouTube when he was 14.<ref name=":0" /> He released his debut mixtape, ''The Mindstate'', in February 2014.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Ju|first=Shirley|date=August 18, 2020|title=Token Talks "30 People" & Never Too Different Label|url=https://allhiphop.com/features/token-talks-30-people-never-too-different-label/|url-status=live|website=[[AllHipHop]]|language=en-US|access-date=January 16, 2022|archive-date=January 16, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220116230821/https://allhiphop.com/features/token-talks-30-people-never-too-different-label/}}</ref>

In 2001, the song "[[Makeshift Patriot]]," recorded on October 11, 2001, became an Internet hit for its critique of American media during and immediately following the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name=RT-BreakingTheSet-VonnegutBusy-2014>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Abby|last2=Francis|first2=Sage|title=Sage Francis Breaks the Stage on 9/11 Fear Mongering, Corporate Hip Hop & Performs 'Vonnegut Busy'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8uK38eTPn8|website=Breaking the Set|format=Video interview|date=11 July 2014|access-date=18 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908133426/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8uK38eTPn8|archive-date=8 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Francis considers "Makeshift Patriot" to be the song that really made things come together for him.

He released the critically acclaimed first solo album ''[[Personal Journals]]'' in 2002. The record ''[[Hope (Non-Prophets album)|Hope]],'' his only album with Joe Beats released under the name [[Non-Prophets]], was named after the state of [[Rhode Island]]'s motto of hope, and was meant to be very Rhode Island-centric.<ref name=HHKMusic-CopperGone-2015>{{cite web|last1=Francis|first1=Sage|last2=Scroobius Pip|title=Sage Francis and Scroobius Pip Copper Gone Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyw1y8mykPE|website=HHKMusic|format=Video interview|date=14 March 2015}}</ref>

Francis broke music genre barriers by getting signed to [[Epitaph Records]], making himself the first hip hop artist to sign with the punk rock label.

Francis has described ''[[A Healthy Distrust]]'' as being a political record, which reflected his mistrust of government and big business with a focus on socio-political matters.<ref name=HHKMusic-CopperGone-2015 />

In May 2007, a music video of the song "Got Up This Morning" from ''[[Human the Death Dance]]'' was released. The song featured vocals by [[Jolie Holland]] and beats produced by [[Buck 65]].

Francis says that he has been releasing mix tapes consistently since 1999, and will continue to release the ''Sick of...'' mix tape series on an ongoing basis.<ref name=HHKMusic-CopperGone-2015 />

He released several ''Sick Of'' mixtapes available on his website.<ref name=RT-BreakingTheSet-VonnegutBusy-2014 />

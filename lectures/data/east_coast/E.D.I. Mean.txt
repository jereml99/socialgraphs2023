'''Malcolm Greenidge''' (born July 7, 1974), known as '''E.D.I Mean''' and '''EDIDON''', is an American hip hop artist and a member of the [[Outlawz]]. The name is a play on the name [[Idi Amin]], former dictator of Uganda. While in the third grade, Malcolm became friends with [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Katari "Kastro" Cox]] who later introduced him to his cousin, [[Tupac Shakur]].<ref name=profile>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hitemup.com/outlawz/profiles-edi.html |title=Outlawz - Profiles, HitEmUp.com<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=March 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120202758/http://www.hitemup.com/outlawz/profiles-edi.html |archive-date=November 20, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Dramacydal==
In 1992, [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], Greenidge, and Tupac's godbrother Yafeu "[[Yaki Kadafi (Outlawz)|Kadafi]]" Fula, formed a rap trio. Greenridge began rapping under the alias "Big Malcolm". The trio went under the names Thoro Headz and Young Thugs.<ref name=profile /> By then, Tupac had become a rap star and they were featured on his single, "[[Holla If Ya Hear Me]]", released on February 4, 1993. In 1994, [[Napoleon (rapper)|Mutah "Napoleon" Beale]] joined the group, which was now known as [[Dramacydal]]. They guest appeared on the songs "Me Against the World" and "Outlaw" from Tupac's LP, ''[[Me Against the World]]'', which was released on March 14, 1995.<ref name=profile /><ref name=outlawz>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/HitEmUpcom/|title=Hit 'Em Up|website=Facebook.com|access-date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>

==Outlawz==
Upon Tupac's release from prison in 1995, Greenidge, Tupac, [[Hussein Fatal|Bruce "Hussein" Washington]], [[Yaki Kadafi (Outlawz)|Kadafi]], Big Syke, Mopreme Shakur, [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], and [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]] formed the group Outlaw Immortalz, which later changed to the [[Outlawz]]. Tupac gave each group member an alias from an enemy of the [[United States of America]]. Shakur gave Greenidge the alias E.D.I Mean after former [[Uganda]]n president [[Idi Amin]]. E.D.I Mean appeared on "Tradin' War Stories," "When We Ride," and "Thug Passion from Tupac's double LP, ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'', which was released on February 13, 1996.<ref name=profile />

On June 4, 1996, Tupac's "[[How Do U Want It]]" single was released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tupacuncensored.com/tupac-cousin-kastro-talks-hit-em-up-impact-via-rare-footage/|title=TUPAC'S COUSIN KASTRO TALKS "HIT 'EM UP" IMPACT VIA RARE FOOTAGE|access-date= June 5, 2022}}</ref>  Its b-side, "[[Hit 'Em Up]]", featured E.D.I Mean, Hussein and Kadafi. It is considered one of the most aggressive [[wiktionary:diss song|diss songs]] in history, dissing [[Bad Boy Entertainment]], [[Chino XL]], [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]] and [[Mobb Deep]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/tupacs-hit-em-up-the-most-savage-diss-track-ever-turns-20|title=Tupac's 'Hit 'Em Up': The Most Savage Diss Track Ever Turns 20|website=[[The Daily Beast]] |access-date= July 12, 2019}}</ref>

On September 7, 1996, Tupac was shot four times in a drive-by-shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was taken to [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas|University Medical Center]] where he died six days later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebony.com/tupac-shakur-dies-six-days-after-las-vegas-shooting/|title=ON THIS DAY: TUPAC SHAKUR DIES SIX DAYS AFTER LAS VEGAS SHOOTING|access-date= September 13, 2018}}</ref> E.D.I Mean was in the car behind Tupac, but claimed he could not identify the murderer. E.D.I Mean and the rest of the Outlawz moved back to the East Coast after Shakur's death.<ref name=profile /> Tupac's LP, ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]'', was released on November 5, 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2011/11/end-of-discussion-2pac-don-killuminati-the-7-day-theory-is-better-than-all-eyez-on-me|title=End of Discussion: Why 2Pac's "The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory" Is Better Than "All Eyez On Me"|website=[[Complex Networks]] |access-date= July 12, 2019}}</ref> E.D.I Mean appeared on three songs, "Intro/Bomb First (My Second Reply)," "Life Of An Outlaw" and "Just Like Daddy. On November 10, just five days after Tupac's album was released, Kadafi was shot in the head in New Jersey, while visiting his girlfriend, and died instantly.  He was found wearing a bullet proof vest.<ref name=profile />

In March 1997, E.D.I Mean and the rest of the Outlawz (minus Fatal) moved back to California and signed with [[Death Row Records]]. Tupac's double LP, "[[R U Still Down? (Remember Me)]]" was released on November 25, 1997. E.D.I Mean produced six songs on it, "Redemption," "Thug Style," "Fuck All Y'all," "Let Them Thangs Go," "When I Get Free," and "Enemies With Me." On December 21, 1999, the Outlawz' debut album, ''[[Still I Rise (album)|Still I Rise]]'', was released.<ref name=interview>{{Cite web |url=http://www.7daynet.com/outlawz/interviews.htm |title=7Daynet.com - Tha Outlawz : Les Interviews<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=March 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206145743/http://www.7daynet.com/outlawz/interviews.htm |archive-date=February 6, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1999, the Outlawz, (excluding Fatal, who by now had a disagreement with the group and felt they had betrayed Tupac by signing with Death Row), started Outlawz Records and released their second and third LPs, ''[[Ride Wit Us Or Collide Wit Us]]'' and ''[[Novakane]]'', on November 7, 2000 and October 23, 2001.<ref name=profile /><ref name=outlawz />

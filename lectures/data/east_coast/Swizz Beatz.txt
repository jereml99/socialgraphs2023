'''Kasseem Daoud Dean''' (born September 13, 1978), known professionally as '''Swizz Beatz''', is an American record producer, rapper, disc jockey (DJ) and songwriter. Born and raised in [[the Bronx]] borough of [[New York City]], Dean initially embarked on his musical career as a [[disc jockey|DJ]]. At the age of 18, he started to gain recognition in the [[hip hop]] industry through his family's record label, [[Ruff Ryders]], as well as his friendship and work with [[East Coast hip hop|Yonkers-based rapper]] [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]. Working with DMX as his producer, DJ and [[hype man]], helped Dean gain prominence as a high-profile personality in hip hop.

Dean later found a protégé in Philadelphia-based rapper [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]], whose success helped the launch of his own label imprint, [[Full Surface Records|Full Surface]], in 2001. He went on to sign multiple artists to the label, including [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Mashonda]] and [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], among others. Dean went on to release two albums under the label; the first was a compilation, titled ''[[Swizz Beatz Presents G.H.E.T.T.O. Stories]]'', released in 2002, and later his debut studio album, ''[[One Man Band Man]]'' in 2007. In November 2018, Dean released his second album, ''[[Poison (Swizz Beatz album)|Poison]]''. Alongside fellow musician [[Timbaland]], Dean is known for creating the popular webcast series ''[[Verzuz]]'' in 2020.

Dean has produced several hit singles for a number of prominent artists across different music genres, such as [[hip hop]], [[pop music|pop]], [[soul music|soul]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. With a career spanning over two decades, his catalog includes "[[Ruff Ryders' Anthem]]", "[[Party Up (Up in Here)]]" (DMX), "[[Gotta Man]]" (Eve), "[[Jigga My Nigga]]", "[[Girl's Best Friend]]" ([[Jay-Z]]), "[[Upgrade U]]", "[[Check on It]]", "[[Ring the Alarm]]" ([[Beyoncé]]), "[[Good Times (Styles P song)|Good Times]]" ([[Styles P]]), "[[Bring Em Out (song)|Bring 'Em Out]]", "[[Swing Ya Rag]]" ([[T.I.]]), "[[Hotel (Cassidy song)|Hotel]]", "[[I'm a Hustla (song)|I'm a Hustla]]" (Cassidy), "[[Touch It (Busta Rhymes song)|Touch It]]" ([[Busta Rhymes]]), "[[Ultralight Beam]]" ([[Kanye West]]), [[Swizz Beatz production discography|and more]].

==Life and career==
===1978–2006: Early life and career beginnings===
He spent much of his childhood raised by his mother in the North East [[Bronx]], where he first encountered [[hip hop]]. After obtaining the necessary equipment from his stepfather and uncles, he began [[disc jockey|DJing]] as a teenager and enjoyed a modicum of success. After relocating to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], due to his repeated involvement in violent behavior at [[Harry S. Truman High School (New York City)|Harry S. Truman High School]], he started to work for his uncles, Joaquin (Waah) and Darrin (Dee) Dean, who were co-CEOs of the [[Ruff Ryders]] record label. In his early work, he generally chose not to [[Sampling (music)|sample]], instead using the [[Korg Trinity]] and [[Korg Triton|Triton]] keyboards and seeking to accentuate the performance aspect of his music.

With his uncles Waah & Dee, as well as his aunt Chivon Dean, all involved with the Ruff Ryders record label, Swizz Beatz began to [[Hip hop production|produce]] tracks at age 16, and was signed to Ruff Ryders Productions as a producer and songwriter. A year later he sold his first beat to Ruff Ryders artist [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], which became his chart-topping single "[[Ruff Ryders' Anthem]]". The song was placed onto DMX's seminal 1998 debut album ''[[It's Dark and Hell is Hot]]''. Dean then began producing major hip-hop songs released in 1998 such as "[[Banned from T.V.]]" by [[Noreaga]], "[[Money, Cash, Hoes]]" by [[Jay-Z]] and more. The following year, he produced most of the songs of the Ruff Ryders compilation album ''[[Ryde or Die Vol. 1]]'', as well as the bulk of [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]]'s [[Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders' First Lady|debut album]]. In 2001, in a joint venture with [[Clive Davis]], Swizz Beatz established his own record label, [[Full Surface Records]], which became a subsidiary of [[J Records]].<ref name="umusicpub">{{cite web|url=http://www.umusicpub.com/spotlight.aspx?id=282|title=Universal Music Publishing|website=Umusicpub.com|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref> The first artist signed was [[Philadelphia]]-based rapper [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]].

When Dean released his first compilation album ''[[Swizz Beatz Presents G.H.E.T.T.O. Stories]]'', in 2002, he began to get noticed for his production style and interesting ideas, as well as his protege and artist, [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]], who also started to gain recognition for his ability as well. The same year, Dean released two [[Single (music)|singles]], "Guilty" and "Bigger Business", both of which charted on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart.<ref>DisCogs entry. [http://www.discogs.com/artist/Swizz+Beatz Swizz Beatz at Discogs]. Discogs. Accessed August 23, 2007.</ref> Along with often being associated with Ruff Ryders and [[Roc-A-Fella Records]], Dean began to expand his scope to include production of artists from more mainstream labels such as [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Epic Records|Epic]], [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] and [[Bad Boy Entertainment]]. His career largely grew from that point.

In February 2007, design duo [[Heatherette]] staged their Fall 2007 New York [[Fashion week|Fashion Week]] [[runway show]], and Dean was asked to mix the music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fashiontribes.typepad.com/main/2007/02/fashionweek_fal_26.html|website=Fashiontribes.typepad.com|title=FASHIONWEEK Fall 2007: Follow the Heatherette Brick Road for Fall|access-date=May 17, 2010|date=February 8, 2007}}</ref> In June 2007, Swizz Beatz produced and was featured on his Full Surface artist Cassidy's comeback single, "[[My Drink n My 2 Step]]", following a murder trial and a car accident.

In a December 2007 interview with ''Format Magazine'', Dean stated that he was already working on his second studio album, at the time under the title ''Life After the Party''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parnham|first=Jason|url=http://www.formatmag.com/features/bun-b-and-swizz-beats/ |title=Bun B and Swizz Beatz « Format Magazine Urban Art Fashion |website=Formatmag.com |date=December 2, 2007 |access-date=May 29, 2011}}</ref>

===2008–18: Monster Music Group===
In 2008, Dean began working on his second studio album. In late 2007, in an interview with ''Format Magazine'' he had announced the title as ''Life After the Party'' saying: "The opportunities that I've got from doing my album (''One Man Band Man'') are much bigger than just producing. A lot of things came from me being able to put a voice to my face. It was me just expressing myself and having the opportunity to – it was the one man band. And now I'm doing part two, which is ''Life After the Party''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formatmag.com/features/bun-b-and-swizz-beats/|title=Bun B and Swizz Beatz|work=Format Magazine Urban Art Fashion|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref>

Dean's second album in the works had been renamed on three occasions: initially, the album was renamed ''King Issues'',<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Rosario |url=http://www.sohh.com/2010/08/swizz_beatz_contemplates_solo_album_titl.html |title=Swizz Beatz Turns To Fans For Album Title, "I'm Done Trying To Name It" |website=Sohh.com |date=August 9, 2010 |access-date=May 29, 2011}}</ref> and was later retitled ''The Perception of Greatness''.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> After initially turning to fans to help decide on an album title, Dean eventually announced in August 2010, while in a New York City recording session with [[Mary J.

His first [[53rd Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] came in 2011, awarded in the category of [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for a track titled "[[On to the Next One]]" teaming him with Jay-Z.

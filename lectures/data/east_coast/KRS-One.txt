'''Lawrence''' "'''Kris'''" '''Parker''' (born August 20, 1965), better known by his stage names '''KRS-One''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|eɪ|_|ɑr|_|ɛ|s|_|ˈ|w|ʌ|n}}; an abbreviation of "Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone") and '''Teacha''', is an American rapper from the [[South Bronx]]. He rose to prominence as part of the hip hop group [[Boogie Down Productions]], which he formed with DJ [[Scott La Rock]] in the mid-1980s. KRS-One is known for his songs "[[Sound of da Police]]", "Love's Gonna Get'cha (Material Love)", and "My Philosophy".Boogie Down Productions received numerous awards and critical acclaim in their early years. Following the release of the group's debut album, ''[[Criminal Minded]]'', fellow artist Scott La Rock was shot and killed, but KRS-One continued the group, effectively as a solo project. He began releasing records under his own name in 1993. He is [[politically]] active, having started the [[Stop the Violence Movement]] after La Rock's death. He is also a [[vegan activist]], expressed in songs such as "Beef".<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUzydGVJSx4| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111031657/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUzydGVJSx4&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=2013-01-11| title=KRS-One Vegan Go Veg 2/12/11 The Roxy West Hollywood, CA|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> He is widely considered an influence on many hip-hop artists.

=== Early life ===
Lawrence Parker was born in the [[New York City borough]] of [[Brooklyn]] in 1965 to an American mother.

=== Hip hop ===
Growing up, Parker had developed a deep love of the emerging hip hop culture in New York, and by that time he was honing his craft as an [[MC (hip hop)|MC]], as well as being an active [[Graffiti_in_New_York_City|graffiti writer]].<ref name="outta_here_video" /> Some time after leaving the group home he moved into a [[homeless shelter]]<ref name="outta_here_video" /> in the [[South Bronx, Bronx|South Bronx]] where he was dubbed "[[Krishna]]" by the residents due to his curiosity about the [[Hare Krishnas|Hare Krishna]] spirituality of some of the anti-poverty workers.<ref name="KRS-One talks about Hare Krishna">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz_DguzvIaY| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211029/Lz_DguzvIaY| archive-date=2021-10-29|title=KRS-One talks about Hare Krishna|last=SeenyT|date=July 8, 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=March 1, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref> During his stay at the community shelter he encountered youth counsellor [[Scott La Rock|Scott Sterling a.k.a.

Together he and Sterling created [[Boogie Down Productions]], releasing their debut album, ''[[Criminal Minded]]'', in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/krs-one/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408071606/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/krs-one/biography|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 8, 2011|title=KRS-One Biography|website=Rollingstone.com|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref>

=== Boogie Down Productions ===
{{Main|Boogie Down Productions}}
KRS-One began his recording career as one third of the hip hop group Boogie Down Productions, or BDP, alongside DJ Scott La Rock and [[D-Nice|Derrick "D-Nice" Jones]]. Additionally, KRS-One had taken offense to "The Bridge", a song by Marley Marl's protege, [[MC Shan]] (KRS-One later reconciled with Marley Marl, producing an album with him in 2007 titled [[Hip Hop Lives]]). The song could be interpreted as a claim that [[Queensbridge Houses|Queensbridge]] was the monument of hip-hop, though MC Shan has repeatedly denied this claim. Still, KRS-One "dissed" the song with the BDP record "South Bronx". A second round of volleys ensued with Shan's "Kill That Noise" and BDP's "The Bridge Is Over". KRS-One, demonstrating his nickname "The Blastmaster", gave a live performance against MC Shan, and many conceded he had won the battle. Many{{who|date=May 2017}} believe this live performance to be the first MC [[Battle rap|battle]] where rappers attack each other, instead of a battle between who can get the crowd more hyped.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361354/|title=Beef|date=August 1, 2003|website=IMDb.com|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref>

Parker and Sterling decided to form a rap group together, initially calling themselves "Scott La Rock and the Celebrity Three". That was short-lived, however, as the two peripheral members quit, leaving Parker (now calling himself KRS-One) and Sterling. They then decided to call themselves "Boogie Down Productions". "Success is the Word", a 12-inch single produced by David Kenneth Eng and Kenny Beck, was released on indie Fresh/Sleeping Bag Records (under the group name "12:41") but did not enjoy commercial success.

Boogie Down Productions released their debut album ''Criminal Minded'' in 1987. Scott La Rock was killed in a shooting later that year, after attempting to mediate a dispute between teenager and BDP member D-Nice and local hoodlums.

During this time KRS-One also gained acclaim as one of the first MCs to incorporate [[Jamaica]]n style into hip-hop, using the Zung gu zung melody, originally made famous by [[Yellowman]] in Jamaican dance halls earlier in the decade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wayneandwax.com/?p=137|title=wayneandwax.com » Follow Me Now: The Zigzagging Zunguzung Meme|website=Wayneandwax.com}}</ref> This is particularly evident in the song titled "Remix for P is Free".  Dancehall influence is also very prominent in the BDP hit "The Bridge is Over", which uses the same melody as [[Super Cat]]'s 1986 dancehall hit "Boops",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldareggae.com/releases/new-tracks/club-rippa-krs-one-where-reggae-meets-hip-hop/| title=Club Rippa – KRS ONE / Reggae's influence on Boogie Down Productions| 
date=2022-02-24| access-date=2023-01-06| website=www.worldareggae.com}}</ref> and lyrical inflections in a Jamaican style.  KRS-One is credited as one of the more influential figures to bridge the gap between Jamaican music and American hip-hop.

Following the fatal shooting of Scott La Rock in 1987, KRS was determined to continue Boogie Down Productions through the tragedy, releasing the album ''[[By All Means Necessary]]'' in 1988. He was joined by [[beatboxing|beatboxer]] D-Nice, rapper [[Ms. Melodie|Ramona "Ms. Melodie" Parker]] (whose marriage to Kris would last from 1988 to 1992), and Kris's younger brother [[DJ]] Kenny Parker, among others. However, Boogie Down Productions would remain KRS' show, and the group's content would become increasingly political through the subsequent releases ''[[Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop]]'', ''[[Edutainment (album)|Edutainment]]'', ''[[Live Hardcore Worldwide]]'' and ''[[Sex and Violence (album)|Sex and Violence]]''.

KRS-One was the primary initiator behind the ''H.E.A.L.'' compilation and the [[Stop the Violence Movement]]; for the latter he would attract many prominent emcees to appear on the 12-inch single "[[Self Destruction]]". As KRS adopted this "humanist", less defensive approach, he turned away from his "Blastmaster" persona and towards that of "The Teacha", although he has constantly used "Blastmaster" throughout his career.

=== Solo career ===
[[File:KRS-One crop.jpg|thumb|left|175px|KRS-One performing in [[Belgium]] in May 2006]]
After five largely solo albums under the name "Boogie Down Productions", KRS-One decided to set out on his own. On his first solo album, 1993's ''[[Return of the Boom Bap]]'', he worked together with producers [[DJ Premier]], [[Kid Capri]] and [[Showbiz and A.G.|Showbiz]], the latter providing the track "[[Sound of da Police]]". His second album, 1995's ''[[KRS-One (album)|KRS-One]]'', featured [[Channel Live]] on "Free Mumia", a song in which they criticize Civil Rights activist [[C. Delores Tucker]] among others. Other prominent guest stars on ''KRS-One'' included [[Mad Lion]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Das EFX]] and [[Fat Joe]].

In 1991, KRS-One appeared on the [[alternative rock]] group [[R.E.M.]]'s single "[[Radio Song]]", which appeared on the band's album ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'', released the same year.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Gill|first=Andy|date=5 March 1991|title=The Home Guard|journal=Q Magazine|volume=55|pages=56–61}}</ref>

In 1992, [[Bradley Nowell]] from [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] featured an acoustic song named "KRS-One" with his voice and DJ's samples.

In 1995, KRS organized a group called [[Channel Live]], whose album ''[[Station Identification (album)|Station Identification]]'' he produced most of, along with [[Rheji Burrell]] and [[Salaam Remi]].

In 1997, KRS surprised many with his release of the album ''[[I Got Next]]''. The album's lead single, "[[Step into a World (Rapture's Delight)]]", containing an interpolation of [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] group [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], was accompanied by a remix featuring commercial rap icon [[Puff Daddy]]; another track was essentially a rock song. While the record would be his best-selling solo album (reaching #3 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]), such collaborations with notably mainstream artists and prominent, easily recognizable samples took many fans and observers of the vehemently anti-mainstream KRS-One by surprise.

In August 1997, in an appearance on [[Tim Westwood]]'s [[BBC Radio 1]], KRS-One criticized the station for not playing underground hip hop while also crediting Westwood for his promotion of hip hop over time. KRS-One said that [[Jive Records]] and Radio 1 did not support him, but finished by saluting Westwood with "you know you're my man".

In 1999, there were tentative plans to release ''Maximum Strength''; a lead single, "5 Boroughs", was released on [[The Corruptor (soundtrack)|''The Corruptor'' soundtrack]]. However, KRS apparently decided to abort the album's planned release, just as he had secured a position as a Vice-President of [[A&R]] at [[Reprise Records]]. The shelved album was again scheduled to be released in 2008, but ultimately an unrelated album entitled ''Maximum Strength 2008'' was released in its place. He moved to southern California, and stayed there for two years, ending his relationship with [[Jive Records]] with ''[[A Retrospective (KRS-One album)|A Retrospective]]'' in 2000.

In 2000, KRS-One and [[DJ Tomekk]] made a video for their single ''[[Return of Hip Hop (Ooh, Ooh)|Return of Hip-Hop]]'' with German rappers Torch and MC Rene, in which hip-hop was revived by hospital staff. The song stayed in the German charts for nine weeks.<ref>[[YouTube]]: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXS8Hf_Hqx0 "Return Of Hip Hop" DJ Tomekk feat KRS One, Torch, Mc Rene – Official Video)]</ref><ref>[[GfK Entertainment charts]]: [https://www.offiziellecharts.de/titel-details-4586 Offizielle Charts]</ref>

[[File:KRS-One 2002.jpg|thumb|Backstage 2002]]

KRS resigned from his A&R position at Reprise in 2001, and returned to recording with a string of albums, beginning with 2001's ''[[The Sneak Attack]]'' on [[Koch Records]]. In 2002, he released a [[gospel music|gospel]]-rap album, ''[[Spiritual Minded]]'', surprising many longtime fans; he had once denounced [[Christianity]] as a "[[slavery|slavemaster]] religion" which African-Americans should not follow. During this period, KRS founded the Temple of Hiphop, an organization to preserve and promote "Hiphop Kulture". Subsequent releases included 2003's ''[[Kristyles]]'' and ''D.I.G.I.T.A.L.'', 2004's ''[[Keep Right]]'', and 2006's ''[[Life (KRS-One album)|Life]]''.

The only latter-day KRS-One album to gain any significant attention has been ''[[Hip-Hop Lives]]'', his 2007 collaboration with fellow hip hop veteran [[Marley Marl]], partly attributed to [[the Bridge Wars]] between the pair, but also the title's apparent response to [[Nas]]' 2006 release ''[[Hip-Hop Is Dead]]''. While many critics have commented they would have been more excited had this collaboration occurred twenty years earlier, the album was met with positive reviews.

KRS-One has collaborated with other artists including Canadian rap group Hellafactz, Jay-Roc N' Jakebeatz and New York producer [[Domingo (producer)|Domingo]]. He and Domingo publicly squashed their beef, which started over financial issues, and released a digital single on iTunes on November 25.{{when|date=July 2019}} The single, titled "Radio", also featured Utah up and comer Eneeone and is dedicated to underground MCs that don't get the radio airplay they deserve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.krsone.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=201&Itemid=1 |title=Archived copy <!-- Deny Citation Bot--> |publisher=Krsone.org |access-date=February 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425150519/http://www.krsone.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=201&Itemid=1 |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2009 KRS-One guest-starred on several albums, including ''Arts & Entertainment'' on the song "Pass the Mic" by fellow hip hop veterans Masta Ace and Ed O.G. KRS-One also featured on the posse cut "Mega Fresh X" by [[Cormega]] (alongside [[DJ Red Alert]], [[PMD (rapper)|Parrish Smith]], [[Grand Puba]], and [[Big Daddy Kane]]) on his album ''[[Born and Raised (Cormega album)|Born and Raised]]''.

KRS-One and Buckshot announced that they would be collaborating on an album set to be released in 2009. The first single, "ROBOT", was released on May 5, 2009. The music video was directed by [[Todd Angkasuwan]] and debuted as the New Joint of the Day on 106 & Park on September 4, 2009. The album itself, called ''Survival Skills'', leaked on the Internet on September 9, 2009, and the album was officially released on September 15, 2009. It debuted at #62, making it onto the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It sold around 8,500 copies its first week and was met with generally positive reviews. Steve Juon of RapReviews.com gave the album a flawless 10 out of 10, claiming, "Buckshot and KRS have achieved something rather remarkable here – an album I can't find a single fault with. There's not a bad beat, there's not a whack rhyme, there's not a collaborator on a track that missed the mark, and the disc itself is neither too short nor too long."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2009_09_survivalskills.html |title=KRS-One & Buckshot :: Survival Skills :: Duck Down Music |publisher=Rapreviews.com |date=September 15, 2009 |access-date=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

In 2010 KRS-One was honored, along with Buckshot, by artists Ruste Juxx, Torae & Skyzoo, [[Sha Stimuli]], Promise, J.A.M.E.S. Watts and Team Facelift, on their mixtape ''Survival Kit'', an ode to the 2009 album ''Survival Skills''. The mixtape was released for free download on DuckDown.com. The album features new version of KRS classics "South Bronx", "[[Sound of da Police]]" and "MC's Act Like They Don't Know", as well as new versions of well-known Buckshot songs and "Past Present Future" from the ''Survival Skills'' album. The MC Fashawn said in his verse on ''MC's Act Like They Don't Know'', "I did it to make Kris smile / I figured he'd appreciate it".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duckdown.com/survivalkit/ |title=Mick Boogie + Nvme + Duck Down Presents: Survival Kit – Free Download!!! |publisher=Duckdown.com |access-date=February 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329031947/http://www.duckdown.com/survivalkit/ |archive-date=March 29, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

KRS-One was featured as the voice of Chris Cringle in [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s Most Valuable Puppets commercials. KRS-One performed in May 2010 at SUNY New Paltz at their annual "Rock Against Racism" concert. He narrated the 2011 film ''Rhyme and Punishment'', a documentary about hip-hop artists who have done jail time. The same year, KRS-One was featured in the title song for the film ''[[You Got Served: Beat the World]]''. The song is entitled "Hip Hop Nation", and features [[K'naan]] and [[Lina (American singer)|Lina]]. It was produced for the film by [[Frank Fitzpatrick]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/beat-world-original-soundtrack/id433793704|title=Beat the World (The Original Soundtrack) by Various Artists on iTunes|website=[[iTunes]]|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref>

=== <span class="anchor" id="Stop the Violence Movement">Stop the Violence Movement</span> ===
The Stop the Violence Movement was formed by KRS-One in 1988/1989 in response to violence in the hip hop and [[African American|black]] communities.

During a concert by Boogie Down Productions and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], a young fan was killed in a fight. Coming soon after the shooting death of his friend and fellow BDP member [[Scott La Rock]], KRS-One was galvanized into action and formed the Stop the Violence Movement. Composed of some of the biggest stars in contemporary [[East Coast hip hop]], the movement released a single, "[[Self Destruction]]", in 1989, with all proceeds going to the [[National Urban League]].<ref name="discogs">[http://www.discogs.com/release/295642 The Stop The Violence Movement – "Self Destruction"], [[discogs.com]].</ref> A music video was created, and a [[VHS]] cassette entitled ''Overcoming Self-Destruction – The Making of the Self-Destruction Video'' was also released.

"Self-Destruction" was produced by KRS-One and [[D-Nice]] of Boogie Down Productions ([[Hank Shocklee]] of [[the Bomb Squad]] is credited as an associate producer).

=== Temple of Hip Hop ===
The Temple of Hip Hop is a ministry, archive, school, and society (M.A.S.S.) founded by KRS-One. Its goal is to maintain and promote Hip Hop Kulture.

The Temple of Hip Hop maintains that hip hop is a genuine political movement, religion, and culture. It calls on all fans to celebrate Hip Hop Appreciation Week on the third week of May each year. It encourages DJs and MCs to teach people about the culture of hip hop and to write more socially conscious songs, and radio stations to play more socially conscious hip hop.

Hip Hop History Month (November), founded by the Universal Zulu Nation, is also recognized.

=== ''Gospel of Hip Hop'' comments ===
In an interview with [[AllHipHop]] about his book ''The Gospel of Hip Hop'', KRS-One said:

<blockquote>I'm suggesting that in 100 years, this book will be a new religion on the earth ... I think I have the authority to approach God directly, I don't have to go through any religion [or] train of thought. I can approach God directly myself and so I wrote a book called The Gospel of Hip Hop to free from all this nonsense garbage right now. I respect the [[Christianity]], the [[Islam]], the [[Judaism]] but their time is up.

== Controversies ==
=== September 11 comments ===
In 2004, KRS said during a panel discussion hosted by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine that "we cheered when [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] happened". His comment was criticized by many sources, including the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', which called him an "[[anarchism|anarchist]]" and said that "If [[Osama bin Laden]] ever buys a rap album, he'll probably start with a CD by KRS-One."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/241988p-207504c.html |title=KRS-One, decency zero |access-date=September 6, 2005 |author=Widdicombe, Ben|work=New York Daily News |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061211170831/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/241988p-207504c.html |archive-date = December 11, 2006|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

KRS responded with an editorial written for [[AllHipHop.com]], stating:

{{blockquote|I was asked about why hiphop has not engaged the current situation more (meaning 9/11), my response was "because it does not affect us, or at least we don't perceive that it affects us, 9/11 happened to them". I went on to say that "I am speaking for the culture now; I am not speaking my personal opinion." I continued to say; "9/11 affected them down the block; the rich, the powerful those that are oppressing us as a culture. [[Sony]], [[RCA]] or [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], [[Universal Music|Universal]], the radio stations, [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]], [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] with [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] and [[MTV]], those are our oppressors, those are the people that we're trying to overcome in hiphop everyday, this is a daily thing. We cheered when 9/11 happened in New York and say that proudly here. Because when they were down at the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|trade center]] we were getting hit over the head by cops, told that we can't come in this building, hustled down to the train station because of the way we dressed and talked, and so on, we were [[racial profiling|racially profiled]]. So, when the planes hit the building we were like, "mmmm, justice." And just as I began to say "now of course a lot of our friends and family were lost there as well" I was interrupted ...}}

In late 2005, KRS was featured alongside Public Enemy's [[Chuck D]] on the remix of the song "Bin Laden" by [[Immortal Technique]] and [[DJ Green Lantern]], which blames [[Neoconservatism (United States)|American neo-conservatives]], the [[Reagan Doctrine]], and U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] for the World Trade Center attacks, and indicates a parallel to the devaluation, destruction, and violence of urban housing project communities.

On April 29, 2007, KRS-One again defended his statements on the September 11 attacks when asked about them during an appearance on ''[[Hannity's America]]'' on the [[Fox News]] network. He stated that he meant that people cheered that the establishment had taken a hit, not that people were dying or had died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cv0NCaKB7A | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513161838/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cv0NCaKB7A| archive-date=2007-05-13|title=KRS-ONE on Hannity's Hot Seat |publisher=YouTube |date=May 18, 2009 |access-date=February 20, 2011}}</ref> He also discussed, among other things, the [[Don Imus]] scandal and the use of profanity in hip-hop.

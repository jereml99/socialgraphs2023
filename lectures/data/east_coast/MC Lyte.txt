Brown later said that the latter was part of a joke started by one of the hosts of the show Tyrone "T Money" Kelsie "he came up with the marriage idea and then mayhem ensued. After the initial show, the story got so big that an interviewer actually asked Lyte about her "marriage"... and instead of her shooting down the rumor, she went along with it."{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}}  Later it was speculated in the media that for a few years she had a relationship with actress [[Tichina Arnold]]. Later these rumors were denied by Arnold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.essence.com/news/tichina-arnold-branching-out/ |title=Tichina Arnold: Branching Out|magazine=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]] |date=December 16, 2009 |access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref> In May 2015 some media speculated that Lyte had dated R&B singer [[Janelle Monae]], but these rumors have not been confirmed by either of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/celebrities/janelle-monae-singer-allegedly-dating-veteran-femcee-mc-lyte/96ks1vj.amp |title=Singer allegedly dating veteran femcee MC Lyte|website=www.pulse.ng. |date=May 1, 2015 |access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/heavy.com/entertainment/2019/02/janelle-monae-partner-girlfriend-dating-history/ |title=Janelle Monae Partner: Is the Singer Dating Anyone?|website=[[Heavy (website)|Heavy]]|date=Jul 19, 2019 |access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>

In early 2016, she started dating [[Marines|Marine Corps]] veteran and entrepreneur John Wyche, after meeting him on [[Match.com]]. They announced their engagement in May 2017. "What can I say, except thank you Lord!!!... It's been a long time, this single life, and I thank you all for your prayers and kind words of hope," she wrote in an [[Instagram]] post dated January 21, 2017. "God has sent me true love. For all of you waiting on LOVE- don't give up – keep God first and he will see that you meet your match." In August they exchanged their vows during a musical wedding in [[Montego Bay]], Jamaica. [[Reggae]] Congo bands played as Lyte walked down the aisle, and the couple's friend [[Kelly Price]] serenaded them during the ceremony. Afterward, an intimate gathering with only close friends and family members was held.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theknotnews.com/mc-lyte-marries-jamaica-wedding-22104|title=MC Lyte Marries Marine Corps Veteran in Jamaica Wedding|last=Chen|first=Joyce|date=August 14, 2017|website=The Knot News|language=en|access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essence.com/celebrity/mc-lyte-wedding-photos|title=MC Lyte Wedding Photos- [site:name]|website=Essence.com}}</ref>

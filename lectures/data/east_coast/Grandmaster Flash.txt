'''Joseph Robert Saddler''' (born January 1, 1958), popularly known by his stage name '''Grandmaster Flash''', is a Barbadian [[DJ]] and [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture|producer]]. He created a DJ technique called the Quick Mix Theory.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> This technique serviced the break-dancer and the rapper by elongating the drum breaks through the use of duplicate copies of vinyl. This technique gave birth to cutting and scratching. It also gave rappers better music with a seamless elongated bed of beats to speak on.<ref>Bethonie Butler.

He is the founder and creator of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]], the first rap group to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2007.<ref name=":4">{{cite web| url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/grandmaster-flash-and-furious-five | title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 2007 Inductees| access-date=September 3, 2017}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> In 2019 he became the first hip hop artist to be honored with the [[Polar Music Prize]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Hip hop DJ pioneer Grandmaster Flash wins Polar Music Prize |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/02/13/hip-hop-dj-pioneer-grandmaster-flash-wins-polar-music-prize.html |access-date=2023-03-28 |website=The Jakarta Post |language=en}}</ref> On May 21, 2022, he acquired an honorary doctorate in Fine Arts from [[Buffalo State University]]. On June 1, 2023, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in music from [[Lehman College]] in the Bronx, NY. On August 4 Grandmaster was issued a proclamation from the city of New York stating that August 4th is Grandmaster Flash day.

== Early life, family and education==
Saddler's family immigrated to the United States from [[Barbados]]. He was raised in [[the Bronx]], New York City, where he attended [[Samuel Gompers High School]], a public vocational school. There, he learned how to repair electronic equipment.<ref name=":2">{{cite book| first= Tricia| last= Rose| title= Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America| place= Hanover| publisher= Wesleyan University Press| year= 1994| page= 35}}</ref> Saddler's parents played an important role in his interest in music. His father was a fan of Caribbean and African American recordings.<ref name="Grandmaster Flash 1982">{{cite interview| author= Grandmaster Flash| interviewer= Steven Harvey| title= Spin Art| work= [[New York Rocker]]| date= January 1982}}</ref>

During his childhood, Joseph Saddler was fascinated by his father's record collection. In an interview, he reflected: "My father was a very heavy record collector.... I used to open his closets and just watch all the records he had. I used to get into trouble for touching his records, but I'd go right back and bother them."<ref name="Grandmaster Flash 1982"/> Saddler's early interest in DJing came from this fascination with his father's record collection as well as his mother's desire for him to educate himself in electronics.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Forman |editor1-first=Murray |editor2-last=Neal |editor2-first=Mark Anthony |title=That's the Joint!: The Hip-Hop Studies Reader |date=2004 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0415873260}}</ref> After high school, he became involved in the earliest New York DJ scene, attending parties set up by early luminaries like [[DJ Kool Herc]] and Disco King Mario.

Saddler's uncle [[Sandy Saddler]] was a [[featherweight]] boxing champion.

== Innovations ==
[[File:Hip Hop turntable, National Museum of American History.jpg|thumb|A [[Technics SL-1200]] turntable formerly belonging to Grandmaster Flash is exhibited as a symbol for [[hip-hop]] culture in the [[National Museum of American History]].]]
Grandmaster Flash observed the styles of the smooth transitions of a disco DJ versus the non-fluid non-BPM-matched transitions of early DJing. He chose to complete his studies with the former. Grandmaster Flash came up with a fingertip-to-vinyl and crossfader technique called the Quik Mix Theory. In doing this, he figured out a mathematical way to cut, paste, repeat, and extend a very minuscule piece of an existing composition.<ref>Bethonie Butler. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/08/23/grandmaster-flash-on-the-get-down-and-how-he-used-science-to-pioneer-dj-techniques/ Grandmaster Flash on ‘The Get Down’ and how he used science to pioneer DJ techniques]." Washington Post. Retrieved 06-0402023.</ref> This innovation took place in two places in the Bronx. The first location was his parents' house, 2730 Dewey Ave in the Throggs Neck Projects of the Bronx. The completion of the Quik Mix Theory was done at 927 Fox Street in the Hunts Point Area of the Bronx.

The Quick Mix Theory gave birth to techniques such as cutting, scratching, and transforming. 
* '''Backspin technique''' (or '''quick-mix theory'''): New York hip-hop DJs understood that Grandmaster Flash's short drum break technique became the way for all hip-hop DJs to play. A quick mix DJ builds a foundation on timing. This particular DJ art form gave birth to human beings having a clean, excellently timed, extended bed of music to speak on. This led to sampling. Sampling led to big business. Today under hip hop's four elements umbrella, this record sampling technique gave birth to what is known as rap, where the emcee or rapper verbally tells their story on a seamless bed of music. 
In addition to Grandmaster Flash's on-time BPM-perfected technique, additional items were needed to pull this off. These items were felt and wax paper.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Banks |first=Alec |title=The Definitive Grandmaster Flash Interview |url=https://rockthebells.com/articles/grandmaster-flash-interview-hip-hop-history/ |access-date=2023-06-20 |website=rockthebells.com |language=en}}</ref> The combination of these two materials cut into the size of a record and placed on the turntable (at that time referred to as a "wafer") allowed the record to move fluidly. The end result of that was the creation of what we today call the Slipmat.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-14 |title=How Grandmaster Flash created The Slipmat |url=https://hiphophero.com/how-grandmaster-flash-created-the-slipmat/ |access-date=2023-06-20 |website=hiphophero.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Another item that played a key role in the successful implementation of the quick mix theory is the needle/stylus. 

He realized that the stylus came in two classes: elliptical, which sounded better but would not stay in the groove, and spherical. The spherical needle, although making the song sound worse, would stay inside the groove. This, in turn, allowed Flash to turn the vinyl counterclockwise to re-arrive at the top of the break.<ref name=":6" />
* '''Punch phrasing''' (or '''clock theory'''): This technique involved isolating very short segments of music, typically horn hits, and rhythmically punching them over the sustained beat using the mixer.
* '''[[Scratching]]''': Although the invention of record scratching as a form of adding to the musical entertainment is generally credited to [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]], Grandmaster Flash perfected the technique and brought it to new audiences. Scratching, along with punch phrasing, exhibited a unique aspect of party DJing: instead of passively spinning records, he manipulated them to create new music.<ref name="Zachary Wallmark 2008">Zachary Wallmark, "Grandmaster Flash," in ''Musicians and Composers of the 20th Century'' (Pasadena: Salem Press, 2008), 531–533.</ref>

{{main|Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five}}

=== 1970s ===
Grandmaster Flash played parties and collaborated with rappers such as [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[Lovebug Starski]]. In the late 1970s, he formed his own group. The original lineup consisted of Cowboy ([[Keef Cowboy]]), [[Melle Mel]] (Melvin Glover), and [[Kidd Creole]] (Nathaniel Glover), and the ensemble went by the name "Grandmaster Flash & the 3 MCs". Cowboy created the term ''[[hip hop]]''.<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8RXefG0Pbc  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/a8RXefG0Pbc |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Origins of Hip Hop with Busy Bee Starski|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="furious5">{{cite web|url=http://www.furious5.net/cowboy.htm |title=Keith Cowboy – The Real Mc Coy |date=March 17, 2006 |access-date=January 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317071002/http://www.furious5.net/cowboy.htm |archive-date=March 17, 2006}}</ref> He created the term while teasing a friend who had just joined the U.S. Army, by [[scat singing]] the words "hip/hop/hip/hop" in a way that mimicked the [[rhythm]]ic cadence of soldiers marching.<ref name="youtube.com"/><ref name="furious5" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGsfXdMRS4c  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/rGsfXdMRS4c |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Afrika Bambaataa talks about the roots of Hip Hop|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Cowboy later worked the "hip hop" cadence into a part of his stage performance.<ref name="youtube.com"/><ref name="furious5" /><ref>''JET'', (April 2007), 36–37.</ref>

Mel was the first rapper to call himself "MC" (Master of Ceremony). Two other rappers briefly joined, but they were replaced more permanently by Rahiem (Guy Todd Williams, previously in the [[Funky 4 + 1|Funky Four]]) and Scorpio (Eddie Morris, a.k.a. Mr. Ness) to make Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Quickly gaining recognition for their skillful raps, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five pioneered MCing and freestyle battles. Some of the staple phrases in MCing have their origins in the early shows and recordings of the group. In 1978, the new group began performing regularly at Disco Fever in the Bronx, one of the first times a hip-hop group was given a weekly gig at a well-known venue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.feverrecords.com/about.shtml |title=Fever Records |publisher=Fever Records |access-date=May 15, 2012 |archive-date=July 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704151242/http://www.feverrecords.com/about.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] were signed to Bobby Robinson's [[Enjoy Records]] and in 1979 released their first single, "Superrappin'".

=== 1980s ===
In 1980 they signed to Sugar Hill Records and began touring and releasing numerous singles. The seminal "[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel]]", released in 1981, is a 7-minute solo showcase of Grandmaster Flash's virtuosic turntable skills, combining elements of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s "Rapture", Michael Viner's Incredible Bongo Band's "Apache", Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust", Chic's "Good Times", and the group's own "Freedom". It is also the first documented appearance of scratching on a record. That year, the group opened for [[The Clash]] and were poorly received by an audience unaccustomed to the new style.<ref>[[Jeff Chang (journalist)|Jeff Chang]], ''[[Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation]]'' (New York: Picador, 2005), 155.</ref>
The group's most significant hit was the [[Electro (music)|electro]] rap song "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" (1982), which was produced by in-house Sugar Hill producer Clifton "Jiggs" Chase and featured session musician Duke Bootee. Unlike earlier rap tunes, "The Message" featured a grim narrative about inner city violence, drugs, and poverty. In 2002, it was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, the first hip hop recording to receive this honor. Critics praised the song's social awareness, calling the chorus "a slow chant seething with desperation and fury."<ref>Vince Aletti, "Furious," ''Village Voice'' (July 20, 1982), 64.</ref>

Other than Melle Mel, no members of the group actually appear in the song. Rahiem lip-synced Duke Bootee's vocal in the music video. The same year, Grandmaster Flash appeared in the movie "[[Wild Style]]" and sued Sugar Hill over the non-payment of royalties. Tensions mounted as "The Message" gained in popularity, eventually leading to a rupture between Melle Mel and Grandmaster Flash. Soon the group disintegrated entirely. Grandmaster Flash, Kidd Creole, and Rahiem left Sugar Hill, signed with [[Elektra Records]], and continued on as simply "Grandmaster Flash", while Melle Mel and the others continued on as "Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five".

Grandmaster Flash was also interviewed in the 1986 cult documentary ''[[Big Fun in the Big Town]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2323202/|title=Big Fun in the Big Town|access-date=January 26, 2019|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

Although frequently credited on the records, Grandmaster Flash does not actually appear on "The Message", "Freedom", or many of the other Furious Five songs.<ref name="Zachary Wallmark 2008"/> Although Grandmaster Flash provided the central element of the group's sound when performing live (in addition to giving the group its name), there was little room for his turntablism in early singles driven by the grooves of live session musicians. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five reformed in 1987 for a charity concert, and in 1988 they released a new album. The group reunited again in 1994, although Cowboy died in 1989.

=== 1990s ===
[[File:Dj Grandmaster Flash-01-mika.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Grandmaster Flash performing in 1999]]
In 1999, Grandmaster Flash recorded with [[DJ Tomekk]] and [[Flavor Flav]] the single ''[[1, 2, 3, ... Rhymes Galore]]''. The single stayed for 17 weeks in the TOP ten of the German charts.<ref>{{Citation|last=Dj Tomekk|title=DJ TOMEKK "1,2,3 RHYMES GALORE" NEW YORK TO GERMANY HI QUALITY|date=February 11, 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SecYu-V6OZ0 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/SecYu-V6OZ0 |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|access-date=June 27, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

=== 2000s ===
In 2008 he released a memoir, ''The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash: My Life, My Beats'',<ref>Grandmaster Flash and David Ritz, ''The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash: My Life, My Beats'' (New York: Doubleday, 2008).</ref> in which he talks about the origins of his fascination with scratching records and creating new beats. From a young age, Flash talks about how he would sneak into his father's record room to watch the record player spin, and then get punished for touching the records. He found inspiration even from things not associated with music. The spokes of his bicycle caused an interest in how record players create music just by rotating a grooved disc. Flash continued to experiment by taking apart any machine he could get his hands on to figure out how it worked. His early work shows the innovative ways in which his artistic abilities led to what is considered the first evolution of hip hop culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Grandmaster Flash and David Ritz, The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash: My Life, My Beats |location=New York|publisher=Doubleday|year=2008}}</ref>

He hosted a weekly show on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] (Friday Night Fire with Grandmaster Flash) and was presented with the BET "I Am Hip Hop Icon" award in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/BET-Awards-Honor-Grandmaster-Flash-39963.shtml |title=BET Awards Honor Grandmaster Flash |publisher=Softpedia |date=November 13, 2006 |access-date=May 15, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612153530/http://news.softpedia.com/news/BET-Awards-Honor-Grandmaster-Flash-39963.shtml |archive-date=June 12, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Aired in 2016, the [[Netflix]] original series ''[[The Get Down]]'' features a version of Grandmaster Flash that is played by [[Mamoudou Athie]]. The series takes place in 1977 New York City and follows the genesis of the [[DJing]], [[B-boying]], graffiti, and emceeing, the four element cultures of hip-hop. After the premiere of ''[[The Get Down]]'', Netflix premiered ''[[Hip-Hop Evolution]]'', a music documentary discussing the history of hip hop in which Grandmaster Flash talks about the evolution of his art.

In 2023, Grandmaster Flash competed in [[The Masked Singer (American season 9)|season nine]] of ''[[The Masked Singer (American TV series)|The Masked Singer]]'' as "Polar Bear". He was eliminated on "New York Night". As part of his encore, some DJ equipment was brought out so that Grandmaster Flash can scratch along to [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]".

Regarding the origin of his stage name, the rapper said:
<blockquote>
Biz comes from the first hip-hop tape I heard. It was '77, '78, from the L Brothers. Grand Wizard Theodore was the DJ, and the rappers was Kevvy Kev, Master Rob and Busy Bee Starski. I loved Busy Bee. Busy Bee just stuck with me. My name used to be Bizzy B Markie, and after a while I put the Biz with the Markie. My nickname in my neighborhood was Markie.<ref name="Manteuffel" /></blockquote>

== Music career ==
=== 1980s ===
Biz Markie was interviewed in the 1986 cult documentary ''[[Big Fun in the Big Town]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2323202|title=Big Fun in the Big Town|date=January 1, 2000|via=IMDb|access-date=July 1, 2018|archive-date=February 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211182610/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2323202/|url-status=live}}</ref> Markie released his debut album ''[[Goin' Off]]'' in 1988, which attracted a fair amount of attention, largely due to the lead single, "Make the Music with Your Mouth, Biz". The album also featured the underground hit singles "Nobody Beats The Biz", "[[Vapors (song)|Vapors]]", and "Pickin' Boogers".<ref>Morris, Mary. [http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_biz_markie/ ''Biz Markie''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108100202/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_biz_markie |date=January 8, 2009 }}. Remix.

On October 10, 1989, Markie's second studio album, ''[[The Biz Never Sleeps]]'' was released on Cold Chillin'/Warner Bros. Records, produced by Markie, his cousin Cool V and Paul C. The single "[[Just a Friend]]", in which he alternates between rap and caterwauling, became Markie's most successful single, reaching No. 9 on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ellise Shafer |url=https://www.yahoo.com/now/biz-markie-rapper-known-just-001437378.html |title=Biz Markie, Rapper Known for 'Just a Friend,' Dies at 57 |publisher=Yahoo.com |date= July 17, 2021|accessdate=July 17, 2021 |archive-date=July 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210717114636/https://www.yahoo.com/now/biz-markie-rapper-known-just-001437378.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The song interpolates the 1968 song "You Got What I Need" by singer-songwriter [[Freddie Scott]], whose basic chord and melody provided the base for the song's chorus.<ref name=npr>{{cite web |author=|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/05/01/180375856/20-years-ago-biz-markie-got-the-last-laugh |title=20 Years Ago Biz Markie Got The Last Laugh : The Record |publisher=NPR |date=May 6, 2013 |accessdate=July 17, 2021 |archive-date=October 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020112852/https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/05/01/180375856/20-years-ago-biz-markie-got-the-last-laugh |url-status=live }}</ref> "Just a Friend" was ranked 81st on VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders in 2000, and later as number 100 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop in 2008.<ref name=vh1 /> The music video, directed by [[Lionel C.

=== 1990s ===
Markie's third studio album ''[[I Need a Haircut]]'' was released on August 27, 1991, on Cold Chillin'/Warner Bros. Records; it was produced by Markie and his cousin Cool V. Sales of the album were already low when Markie was served a lawsuit by [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]], who claimed that the album's "Alone Again" featured an unauthorized sample from his hit "[[Alone Again (Naturally)]]". O'Sullivan's claim was upheld in a [[landmark ruling]], ''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.]]''<ref>''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records, Inc.]]'', 780 F. Supp. 182 ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1991)</ref> that altered the landscape of hip-hop, finding that all samples must be cleared with the original artist before being used. In accordance with the ruling, Warner Bros., the parent company of Cold Chillin', had to pull ''I Need a Haircut'' from circulation, and all companies had to clear samples with the samples' creators before releasing the records. This development reflected the increasing popularity of hip-hop and the financial stakes over which were set. Markie responded in 1993 with the mischievously titled ''[[All Samples Cleared!]]'', but his career had been hurt by the publicity emanating from the lawsuit, and the record suffered accordingly.<ref name=npr />

For the remainder of the decade, Markie occasionally made television appearances, including guest appearances on ''[[In Living Color]];'' as contestant Damian "Foosball" Franklin in the recurring game show sketch "The Dirty Dozens"; as Marlon Cain in "Ed Bacon: Guidance Counselor";<ref>{{cite web |author=|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/20-greatest-hip-hop-moments-in-living-color/ |title=20 Greatest Hip-Hop Moments on 'In Living Color' – XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=January 5, 2018 |accessdate=July 17, 2021 |archive-date=October 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201025225612/https://www.xxlmag.com/20-greatest-hip-hop-moments-in-living-color/ |url-status=live }}</ref> in a 1996 [[freestyle rap]] commercial on [[MTV2]]; and in the 1993 superhero film ''[[The Meteor Man (film)|Meteor Man]]''. He also made numerous guest appearances with the [[Beastie Boys]] on ''[[Check Your Head]]'' (1992), ''[[Ill Communication]]'' (1994), ''[[Hello Nasty]]'' (1998), and their anthology ''[[Beastie Boys Anthology: The Sounds of Science|The Sounds of Science]]'' (1999).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2004/06/18/men-who-motivated-beastie-boys/|title=The men who motivated the Beastie Boys|website=EW.com|access-date=July 17, 2021|archive-date=July 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210717114639/https://ew.com/article/2004/06/18/men-who-motivated-beastie-boys/|url-status=live}}</ref> He also rapped on the song "Schizo Jam" on Don Byron's 1998 release, ''[[Nu Blaxploitation]]'' (Blue Note/Capitol) and worked with [[Canibus]] on the first track on the [[Office Space soundtrack|''Office Space'' soundtrack]] (1999).

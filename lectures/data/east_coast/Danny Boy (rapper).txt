'''Daniel O'Connor''' (born December 12, 1968), better known as '''Danny Boy''' or '''Danny Boy O'Connor''', is an American rapper, art director, and the executive director of [[The Outsiders House Museum]]. O'Connor spent his childhood in New York, before moving to Los Angeles in the 1980s. In the 1990s, O'Connor co-founded the rap group [[House of Pain]], with fellow rapper Erik Schrody ([[Everlast]]) and DJ Leor Dimant ([[DJ Lethal]]). Based on their cultural heritage they fashioned themselves as rowdy Irish-American hooligans. O'Connor played the role of art director, designing logos, branding, hype man, and co-rapper. In 1992, with the singles "[[Jump Around]]" and "[[Shamrocks and Shenanigans (Boom Shalock Lock Boom)|Shamrocks and Shenanigans]]", their [[House of Pain (album)|self-titled debut album]], also known as ''Fine Malt Lyrics'', went platinum.

They followed it up with ''[[Same as It Ever Was]]'' (1994), which went gold, and ''[[Truth Crushed to Earth Shall Rise Again]]'' (1996), before they all went their separate ways. O'Connor took part in several music projects, and continued doing designs as freelance work. In 2006, O'Connor founded the rap group [[La Coka Nostra]] where he was joined by George Carroll ([[Slaine (rapper)|Slaine]]), William Braunstein ([[Ill Bill]]), Dimant, and Schrody (only for the first album). Together they have three releases: ''[[A Brand You Can Trust]]'' (2009),  ''[[Masters of the Dark Arts]]'' (2012) and ''[[To Thine Own Self Be True]]'' (2016).

In 2016, O'Connor, who is a lifelong fan of [[S.&nbsp;E. Hinton]]'s book [[The Outsiders (novel)|''The Outsiders'']] and [[The Outsiders (film)|its film adaptation]] by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], bought the house used in the film located in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. He turned it into a museum named [[The Outsiders House Museum]], that contains much of the book and film memorabilia. For his effort preserving a cultural landmark he received a key to the city.

== Early life ==
O'Connor was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, on December 12, 1968. His father was incarcerated when O’Connor was two months old. O’Connor and his mother moved to [[Los Angeles]] when he was six. When O’Connor was seventeen his father, a homeless alcoholic, was murdered by someone who poured gasoline on him to set him on fire. During that time O’Connor was in a gang involved in petty crimes, and he was placed on probation.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |last=Tramel |first=Jimmie |title=Danny Boy O'Connor overcomes rough past to salvage his life and Outsiders House |url=https://tulsaworld.com/entertainment/danny-boy-oconnor-overcomes-rough-past-to-salvage-his-life-and-outsiders-house/article_e4646638-fb66-11eb-8e17-5712ffd3d6c2.html |access-date=2022-04-26 |website=Tulsa World |language=en}}</ref>

==Career==

=== 1990–1992: Founding House of Pain and breakthrough ===
In 1990, O'Connor got together with fellow rapper Erik Schrody ([[Everlast]]) who had just released a rap album called ''[[Forever Everlasting]]'' (1990), that didn't have much success. O'Connor knew Schrody when he went to [[William Howard Taft High School (Los Angeles, California)|William Howard Taft High School]] in [[Woodland Hills, California]] (1984–1986), and various hip hop event they attended in their teens. Both of Irish descent, they decided to make a hip hop group with this identity. While hanging out at O'Connor's home, Schrody noticed a cassette with the title ''House of Pain'', which was a demo of a [[Punk rock|Punk]] group O'Connor tried to put together. Schrody really liked the name and felt they should re-use as their name. Schrody brought in his former DJ Leor Diamant ([[DJ Lethal]]), who is actually of Latvian descent, and [[House of Pain|House of pain]] was created.{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}} While in House of Pain, O'Connor acted as the hype man, second [[emcee]], art director and the graphic artist of the group.<ref name="FromOutside">{{cite news |last=Graham |first=Ginnie |date=May 5, 2017 |title=From the Outside: Hip-hop artist Danny Boy O'Connor saves a house, finds a mission |url=https://tulsaworld.com/lifestyles/magazine/from-the-outside-hip-hop-artist-danny-boy-o-connor-saves-a-house-finds-a/article_6cd301fc-bff8-5875-ab31-5945d00bf48c.html |work=Tulsa World |location=Tulsa, OK |access-date=July 28, 2021}}</ref> After they recorded a demo, for which O'Connor designed the cover, that created a bidding war among labels.

=== 1993–1996: Subsequent success and group's breakup ===
In 1993, O'Connor with his group mates were among the rap artists who had cameo roles in [[Ted Demme]]'s film ''[[Who's the Man?]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Who's the Man? |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/whos-the-man/cast/2030109905/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220424173456/https://www.tvguide.com/movies/whos-the-man/cast/2030109905/ |archive-date=April 24, 2022 |access-date=2022-04-24 |website=TVGuide.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Blenkle |first=Joe |date=April 28, 1993 |title='Who's the man?' mixes rap, comedy |pages=B1 |work=The Folsom Telegraph}}</ref> For this project they provided [[Who's the Man?

=== 1997–2018: return from obscurity and back to prominence ===
After House of Pain disbanded, O'Connor said he struggled with drug abuse, a problem he developed when he became famous, and spent all the money he made from the group's success.{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}} He said he sobered up briefly in 2000 joining the [[twelve-step program]] but relapsed after a having a drink,{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}} and rejoined the program in 2005, and stayed sober ever since.<ref name="FromOutside" />

Nevertheless, O'Connor continued being involved in musical projects and did freelance work such as logo designing, streetwear, and sneakers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}}

In late 2004, the creation of the rap [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[La Coka Nostra]] started when O'Connor was mentoring young artists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}} O'Connor explains that he tool notice of two up and comers George Carroll ([[Slaine (rapper)|Slaine]]) and John Faster (Big Left) and brought them to meet his former DJ from House of Pain, Leor Diamant.<ref>Emerick Tackett (2006). <nowiki>''Giving hip hop a bump''</nowiki>.

The group started releasing music on [[Myspace|MySpace]], and went viral. Eventually, O'Connor felt that there was a void and asked experienced rapper William Braunstein ([[Ill Bill]]) to join. The group's name came about, when O'Connor teased other members with that nickname, after they had a night out.  Eventually, former House of Pain colleague Erik Schrody, showed interest to join. By 2008, the group consisted of O'Connor, Carroll, Diamant, Braunstein, and Schrody (who left some time after the first album was released).{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}}

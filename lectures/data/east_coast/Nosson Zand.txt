'''Nathan Isaac Zand''' (born December 11, 1981), also known as '''Nosson Zand''', is an American [[Chasidic]] [[rapper]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/track/inside_track/view/2009_03_09_Rapper|title=Hasidic rapper credits Brookline hip-hop roots|publisher=[[Boston Herald]]|date=9 March 2009}}</ref>

==Biography==
Zand was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], on December 11, 1981. He is best known by  his [[Hebrew]] name Nosson.

Growing up in Brookline, he went to [[Brookline High School]], where he took trumpet lessons and was exposed to rap by a friend from the [[Public housing|projects]]. They spent their school days rapping in the halls, on the street, at parties, talent shows and [[open mic]] events. His first show was at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. He then entered [[Clark University]] where he studied [[French language]] and U.S. history.

He performed on campus with [[Toots and the Maytals]],{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Heather B, [[The Last Poets|The LastPoets]]{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and multiple solo gigs.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://springflingatcta.blogspot.com.es/2011/05/nosson-zand-poster.html |title=Spring Fling at CTA: Nosson Zand Poster |publisher=Springflingatcta.blogspot.com.es |date=2011-05-08 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thatswhatshesaidboston.com/2011/06/2340/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714175936/http://thatswhatshesaidboston.com/2011/06/2340/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |title=Local Love: Nosson Zand // THATS WHAT SHE SAID }}</ref>
Upon graduating, he went to live and work in [[France]] where he worked as an English teacher. In [[France]] he met some [[Hasidic Jews]]  from the [[Chabad]] movement, and liked their way of life. He then started a new style which he called "Chasidic rap", in which he aimed to present lyrics with a positive message.
He performed at night clubs and other venues throughout [[France]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 2004 he returned to Boston, where he worked odd jobs and played gigs in Boston, [[New York City]], [[Florida]] and [[Texas]].
In a chance encounter in Boston he met [[Matisyahu]] and rapped for him.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Matisyahu then asked Nosson to perform with him on [[Avalon, California]] and in South Paw in [[Brooklyn]], New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKqBUSqL3OE |title=NOSSON and Matisyahu at Avalon - Boston 12-20-06 |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-12-27 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref>

After further gigs and performance with Matisyahu, in 2007 he went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to play the lead role in ''Song of David'' a movie about a young [[Hasid]] who is studying to become a [[rabbi]] in a [[Los Angeles]] [[yeshiva]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/13013/david-s-the-singer-he-s-the-rapper-/ |title=David's the Singer, He's the Rapper – |publisher=Forward.com |date= 27 March 2008|accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> Alienated by the social boundaries that enclose him, he reaches out to the broader world. He becomes obsessed with rap music, wherein he discovers artistic freedom and honest self-expression. He then must choose between diverging worlds. With this film Nosson won the "Best Actor Award" at the [[Boston International Film Festival]].

In 2008 he completed his first EP ''The Return'' and performed with Matisyahu on a 35 city tour of US and Canada, including at Matisyahu's 8-show "Festival of Light" in New York City, the name of which is a reference to the Jewish [[Festival of Lights (Judaism)|Festival of Lights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK3VM8JTF1w |title=Nosson Zand with Matisyahu in NYC |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref>

In 2013, Zand released his first full-length album "Believers", which includes a song of the same name featuring [[Matisyahu]]. It is available on Spotify, iTunes and Google Play. He has also made a music video of his song featuring Matisyahu and posted it on YouTube.

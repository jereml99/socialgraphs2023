==Early life==
Pearson was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], the daughter of two incarcerated drug addicts, and was raised in an East Baltimore [[foster home]]. Born premature and weighing three pounds, she was not expected to live.<ref name=bsunLegal311201>{{cite news |last=McCauley |first=Mary Carol |title=Legal troubles nothing new for 'Wire' actress |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bs-xpm-2011-03-11-bs-md-felicia-pearson-20110310-story.html |access-date=March 11, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=March 11, 2011 }}</ref>  She was so small that she was fed with an eyedropper until she could be fed normally.<ref name="bsunLegal311201" /> According to her memoir, ''[[Grace After Midnight]]'', she met her biological parents very few times, her mother was a [[crack cocaine|crack]] addict, and her father was an armed robber. As a result of this, she decided to go by her foster family's surname.

Pearson was a [[tomboy]] from a young age and worked as a [[drug dealer]] as a teenager. At the age of fourteen, she was convicted of [[second degree murder]] after the shooting of a girl named Okia Toomer. Pearson was sentenced to two eight-year terms, to be served consecutively, at the [[Maryland Correctional Institution for Women]] in [[Jessup, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.citypaper.com/arts/story.asp?id=15035 |author=Hunnie, Jaye |title=Felicia's Journey |work=Baltimore City Paper |date=January 2, 2008 |access-date=May 12, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231061335/http://citypaper.com/arts/story.asp?id=15035 |archive-date=December 31, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She was released after six and a half years.

Pearson said her life turned around at the age of eighteen, when Arnold Loney, a local drug dealer who looked out for her and sent her money in prison, was shot and killed.<ref name="bsunLegal311201" /> He had coined her nickname "Snoop," because she reminded him of [[Charlie Brown]]'s beagle [[Snoopy]] in the comic strip ''[[Peanuts]]''.<ref name="bsunLegal311201" /> While in prison, Pearson earned her [[GED]]. She was released in 2000,<ref name="bsunLegal311201" /> and landed a local job [[metal fabrication|fabricating]] car bumpers, but was fired after two weeks when her employer learned she had a prison record.<ref name="New">{{cite news |last1=Dawkins |first1=Walter |title=An Actress's Hard Life Feeds 'Wire' Character |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/21/arts/television/21wire.html |access-date=13 January 2022 |work=The New York Times |date=21 October 2006}}</ref>

'''Bashar Barakah Jackson''' (July 20, 1999 – February 19, 2020), known professionally as '''Pop Smoke''', was an American rapper. Born and raised in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, Pop Smoke began his musical career in late 2018 with his debut single "MPR (Panic Part 3 Remix)". He rose to fame with the release of his breakout singles "[[Welcome to the Party (Pop Smoke song)|Welcome to the Party]]" and "[[Dior (song)|Dior]]" in 2019. He often collaborated with [[UK drill]] artists and producers, who employed more minimal and aggressive instrumentation than [[Drill music|American drill]] artists from Chicago, reintroducing the sound as [[Brooklyn drill]].

Following his rise to fame, record producer [[Rico Beats]] introduced Pop Smoke to [[Steven Victor]] in April 2019. Victor would later have Pop Smoke sign a recording contract with [[Victor Victor Worldwide]] and [[Republic Records]]. He released his debut [[mixtape]] ''[[Meet the Woo]]'' in July 2019. His second mixtape, ''[[Meet the Woo 2]]'', was released on February 7, 2020, and debuted at number seven on the [[Billboard 200|'' Billboard'' 200]], becoming the rapper's first top-10 project in the United States.

Twelve days after the mixtape's release, Pop Smoke was murdered during a home invasion in Los Angeles. New York rapper [[50 Cent]] was the executive producer of his posthumous debut studio album, ''[[Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon]]'', released on July 3, 2020. The album debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 and all 19 tracks from the album were charted on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The album also spawned a string of international top-10 singles, including "[[For the Night]]" (featuring [[DaBaby]] and [[Lil Baby]]) and "[[What You Know Bout Love]]". A year later, Republic Records released Pop Smoke's second studio album, ''[[Faith (Pop Smoke album)|Faith]]'', on July 16, 2021.

===Remembrance===
Jackson's parents, Audrey and Greg Jackson, shared memories of their son before saying how gun violence took him away from them.

{{Cquote|On February 19th, at 4:00 AM, a gun was used to take my son from me. You know him as Pop Smoke, we called him 'Shar'. Because of gun violence, I'll never see my son run up the front of our steps, taking them two at a time; he won't ever take my hands again and dance with me; he won't come into my room and muscle pose in the mirror. Gun violence destroys families. It must stop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rapper-pop-smoke-killed-home-23530595|title=Rapper Pop Smoke was killed in home invasion after tragic social media mistake|website=[[Daily Mirror]]|last1=Woodcock|first1=Zara|last2=Pike|first2=Molly|date=February 19, 2021|access-date=February 19, 2021|archive-date=February 18, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220218094423/https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rapper-pop-smoke-killed-home-23530595|url-status=live}}</ref>

Danny Schwartz wrote in [[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] that "Pop Smoke conquered New York rap and gave the city the kind of readymade and potentially defining star it hadn't seen in years".

Jackson's work ethic was widely praised by his peers in the music industry.

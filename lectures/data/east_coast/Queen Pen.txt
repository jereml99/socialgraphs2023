==Personal life==
After the release of the single, "Girlfriend," that contained themes that were taboo in the hip-hop community at the time, some media sources presumed Queen Pen to be bisexual or lesbian.<ref name="daveyd"/><ref name="nytimes">{{cite web|last=Jamison|first=Laura|title=A Feisty Female Rapper Breaks a Hip-Hop Taboo|url=http://www.prismnet.com/~larrybob/queenpen.html|work=[[New York Times]]|via=prismnet.com|date=January 18, 1998|access-date=May 16, 2013}}</ref>  During the song's release, Queen Pen remained coy about her sexuality and would not disclose it unless it was going to be a "front page" story.<ref name="nytimes"/> She also added that if she told the press she was straight, she would be viewed as a liar; in turn, if she were to say she was gay, she would be viewed as someone trying to get publicity.<ref name="nytimes"/> In 2001, Queen Pen disclosed in an interview that she was neither bisexual nor lesbian.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Nina|last=Flowers|title=Revolutions > Queen Pen: Conversations with Queen|magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=July 2001|issue=131}}</ref>

==Controversy==

===Feud with Foxy Brown===
In 1998, a dispute between [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]] and Queen Pen developed over her controversial lesbian-themed single "Girlfriend."<ref name="daveyd">{{Cite web|last=D|first=Davey|title=May '98 Hip Hop News|url=http://www.daveyd.com/fnvmaynews.html|work=Davey D's Hip Hop Corner|publisher=daveyd.com|date=May 15, 1998|access-date=May 16, 2013}}</ref> Brown, who took offense to the song's subject, spewed [[homophobia|homophobic]] remarks at both Pen and former rival [[Queen Latifah]] via her [[diss track]] "10% Dis".<ref name="daveyd"/><ref name="rapgenius">{{cite web|title=Funkmaster Flex – 10% Dis Lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Funkmaster-flex-10-dis-lyrics|work=[[Rap Genius]]|access-date=May 8, 2013}}</ref> In response, Pen reportedly confronted Brown while barefoot in the lobby of Nevada's Reno Hilton during the Impact Music Convention and tried to slap her and chase her down an elevator.<ref name="daveyd"/><ref name="vibe3">"Vibe Confidential: Everything You Want to Know Before You're Supposed to Know It." ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]''. August 1998: 44.

Again, the conflict was subdued before any further physical contact occurred.<ref name="vibe3"/>

In late 1998, Brown released another diss track titled "Talk to Me", which contained more homophobic remarks directed at Pen and Queen Latifah.<ref name="rapgenius2">{{cite web|title=Foxy Brown – Talk To Me Lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Foxy-brown-talk-to-me-lyrics|work=[[Rap Genius]]|access-date=May 8, 2013}}</ref> In 2001, Pen responded to the diss track with her record "I Got Cha," in which Queen Pen called Brown a "bum bitch," and later made remarks about her being funny and fake "like a [[drag queen]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen Pen – I Got Cha Lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Queen-pen-i-got-cha-lyrics|work=[[Rap Genius]]|publisher=rapgenius.com|access-date=May 16, 2013}}</ref> Although Queen Pen insisted the song was not about Brown, she responded in an [[MTV]] interview: "You make a record about me, I make a record about you.

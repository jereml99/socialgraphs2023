<blockquote>
When Christina [Aguilera] had me work with her, people were like, "Oh no. Please don't." Then, when they heard "Ain't No Other Man," "Back In The Day," and all the other records were still constructed like Premier tracks they were like, "Yo, I really love this album. I was really impressed. I was worried, but you totally sound like what we love about you." Until you hear it, don't say a word. I never want to be just attached to hip hop. I want to be attached to music—country, rap, soul, jazz, blues, it doesn't matter, gospel music—I come from all of that.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Premier definitely coached me when I was in the booth. "harder..stronger..more this..more that"—I was an untamed artist and rapping next to recording your vocals are different. He gave me this knowledge through the work we did.
</blockquote>

Besides the Gang Starr Foundation, Premier is closely affiliated with [[M.O.P.]], which he names as one of his all-time favorite groups. The relationship started with the remix of "Rugged, Neva Smoove" in 1994, a single from the group's first album, which also included the exclusive B-side "Downtown Swinga." From then, Premier produced about one-third of the songs on each subsequent album and overseeing and mixing the projects. On M.O.P.'s 2009 ''[[Foundation (M.O.P. album)|Foundation]]'' album, Premier provided only one track, which was called "What I Wanna B."

On May 16, 2019, DJ Premier released a collaboration with [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo (New York)]] rappers [[Conway The Machine]], [[Westside Gunn]], and [[Benny the Butcher]], called "Headlines."

In June 2020, DJ Premier produced a track for [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] called "State of the Union (STFU)".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/public-enemy-share-new-song-state-of-the-union-stfu-listen/|title=Public Enemy Share New Song "State of the Union (STFU)"|first=Evan|last=Minsker|website=Pitchfork.com| date=June 19, 2020 |access-date=June 22, 2021}}</ref>

== Style and influences ==

DJ Premier's style of production epitomizes the New York sound of his earlier peers. He is known for [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] [[jazz]], [[funk]], and [[soul music|soul]] artists, as well as sampling an artist's past work when creating a new track for that same artist. For example, on Jay-Z's "So Ghetto", from the 1999 album ''[[Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter]]'', Premier samples an older Jay-Z song, 1997's "Who You Wit II".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/sample/73936/Jay-Z-So-Ghetto-Jay-Z-Who-You-Wit-II/|title=Jay-Z's 'So Ghetto' – Discover the Sample Source|website=WhoSampled.com|access-date=June 22, 2021}}</ref> In addition, his encyclopedic memory of hip-hop lyrics allows him to distinctively speak with his hands by scratching in lyrics from several different songs to construct new phrases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=10&csid1=869|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513142756/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=10&csid1=869|url-status=dead|title=Exclaim! Canada's Music Authority<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=May 13, 2006|access-date=June 22, 2021}}</ref> Premier's beats are known for his oft-imitated combinations of short vocal samples, often from multiple artists, to create a chorus. Premier has also experimented with [[Atonality|atonal]] samples that are not confined to soul, jazz, and funk. For example, he sampled and chopped up seminal [[Electroacoustic music|electro-acoustic]] music from the 1960s on the track "Physical Stamina" by Jeru the Damaja.

In an interview with ''[[XXL Magazine]]'', DJ Premier was asked how his sound evolved, to which he replied, "[[Marley Marl]] is my number-one inspiration. [[Jam Master Jay]], Mix Master Ice, and [[UTFO]]. Grandmaster D, and [[Whodini]]. [[DJ Cheese]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Kool Herc]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]]. [[Jazzy Jay]]—even [[Cut Creator]]. Seeing them do what they do. It's black music, it's black culture, it comes from the ghetto. How can you not relate to ghetto people when that's the rawest form of blackness? Even though it's not a good place in regards to the economy and how bad people have it in the neighborhood, the realism's there, and that's what we were born out of. So I very much pay respect by doing the same type of music in return."<ref>{{Cite journal | title = FEATURES.

== Business career ==

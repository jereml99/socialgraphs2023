He has an older sister, Nasheema Williams. Kathy grew up in poverty and her mother died when she was young. Meek's father was killed when Meek was five years old, apparently during an attempted robbery. His uncle, Robert, described Meek Mill's father as a "[[black sheep]] of the family". After her husband's death, Kathy moved with Meek and his sister to [[North Philadelphia]], where they lived in a three-bedroom apartment on Berks Street. Their financial condition was poor and she started cutting hair, doing other jobs, and shoplifting in order to support her family.<ref>{{cite web | last=Leibovitz | first=Liel | title=Robert Kraft Visits Meek Mill in Prison | website=Tablet Magazine | date=April 12, 2018 | url=https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/259813/robert-kraft-visits-meek-mill-in-prison | access-date=February 26, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227120807/https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/259813/robert-kraft-visits-meek-mill-in-prison | archive-date=February 27, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref> At home, Meek was shy and rarely spoke. As a kid, he became acquainted with another of his father's brothers, who under the MC name Grandmaster Nell was a pioneering [[disc jockey]] (DJ) in the late-1980s Philadelphia hip-hop scene and influenced rap artists [[Will Smith]] and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]]. Meek's interest in [[hip-hop]] grew as a result of these early influences. He was also influenced by the independent hip-hop artists Chic Raw and Vodka, whom he learned to emulate by watching their DVDs.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite magazine|url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6648433/meek-mill-nicki-minaj-drake-beef-dreams-worth-more-than-money-interview|title= Meek Mill Opens Up About His Relationship With Nicki Minaj, His Beefs And Why 'He's Scared To Be Political': Exclusive|author= Ben Detrick|magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher= [[Guggenheim Partners]]|date= July 28, 2015|access-date= August 16, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150817081521/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6648433/meek-mill-nicki-minaj-drake-beef-dreams-worth-more-than-money-interview|archive-date= August 17, 2015|url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="TheFader">{{cite magazine|url= http://www.thefader.com/2015/05/26/meek-mill-cover-story-interview|title= America Is Brutal And Meek Mill Is A Hero|author= Will Stephenson|magazine= [[The Fader]]|date= May 26, 2015|access-date= August 1, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150731140657/http://www.thefader.com/2015/05/26/meek-mill-cover-story-interview|archive-date= July 31, 2015|url-status= live}}</ref>
 
During his early teenage years, Meek often took part in [[rap battle]]s under the [[pseudonym]] Meek Millz. He often stayed up well past midnight filling notebooks with phrases and verses that he later drew on. Later he and three friends formed the rap group The Bloodhoundz. They bought blank [[Compact disc|CDs]] and jewel cases at [[Kinkos]], encouraging friends to burn them with the group's songs and distribute them.

==Career==
=== 2006–2010: Career beginnings ===
The Bloodhoundz lasted long enough to release four [[mixtape]]s.<ref name="background">{{cite news|last=Pajot|first=S|title=Meek Mill on Dreams & Nightmares Debut: "The Dream Is Gettin' Paid for What I Love, The Nightmare Was Makin' It to This FOLLOW @OBEY_CHIEFGANG Point"|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2012/08/meek_mill_interview_maybach_music_dreamchasers_tour_dreams-and-nightmares_miami.php|access-date=August 19, 2012|newspaper=[[Miami New Times]]|date=August 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807153800/http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2012/08/meek_mill_interview_maybach_music_dreamchasers_tour_dreams-and-nightmares_miami.php|archive-date=August 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> From 2006 to 2008 Mill released three solo mixtapes including ''The Real Me'', ''The Real Me 2'', and ''Flamers''. In 2009, Mill released his fourth solo mixtape, ''Flamers 2: Hottest in tha City,'' which spawned the [[promotional single]]s "I'm So Fly," "Prolli," and "Hottest in the City." ''Flamers 2'' caught the attention of Charles "Charlie Mack" Alston, founder and president of 215 Aphillyated Records. Mack, who previously represented for other Philadelphians Will Smith, DJ Jazzy Jeff, [[Boyz II Men]] and [[Ms. Jade]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Williams |first=Stereo |title=Charlie Mack: Philly's Favorite Hip-Hop Folk Hero |url=https://rockthebells.com/articles/the-legend-of-charlie-mack/ |access-date=2022-05-30 |website=rockthebells.com |language=en}}</ref> was so impressed with Mill that he immediately signed him to his management company. During that same year, Meek Mill also met the founder and owner of [[Grand Hustle Records]], [[Atlanta]]-based rapper and record executive [[T.I.]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idprQ7oQAqk |title=T.I.

Records]]; within a week both record companies offered him a deal. Although he was offered other record deals, Mill felt collaborating with T.I. was "an opportunity of a lifetime" and thus chose his label. However, a setback occurred, when Mill was sentenced to a stint in jail for a drug and gun charge.<ref name="background"/>

After being released in 2009, he continued working as an artist under Grand Hustle, Mill formed a work relationship with the label's resident [[disc jockey]], [[DJ Drama]]. Mill and Drama teamed up to release the third edition of Mill's ''Flamers'' series. The mixtape, titled ''Flamers 3: The Wait Is Over'', was released on March 12, 2010, and is helmed as a "[[Gangsta Grillz]] mixtape".<ref name="flamers3">{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Jayson|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1651032/meek-mill-expands-on-philly-fame-with-dj-dramas-help.jhtml|title=Meek Mill Expands On Philly Fame With DJ Drama's Help - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV.com|date=October 28, 2010|access-date=October 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203001716/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1651032/meek-mill-expands-on-philly-fame-with-dj-dramas-help.jhtml|archive-date=February 3, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allflamerz.com/2009/08/meek-mill-dj-drama-announce-flamers-3.html|title=Meek Mill & DJ Drama Announce Flamers 3 Gangsta Grillz|publisher=Allflamerz.Com|access-date=October 7, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230428/http://www.allflamerz.com/2009/08/meek-mill-dj-drama-announce-flamers-3.html|archive-date=February 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The mixtape features his promotional single "Rosé Red", which was later [[remix]]ed with additional [[verse (popular music)|verses]] from fellow American rappers T.I., [[Rick Ross]] and [[Vado (rapper)|Vado]].<ref name="flamers3"/> Rick Ross contributed his verse after he was visiting Philadelphia and asked his [[Twitter]] followers who he should collaborate with; Meek Mill was the overwhelming response.<ref name="flamers3"/> The remix was included on Mill's following mixtape, ''Mr. Philadelphia''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/Meek-Mill-Mr-Philadelphia-mixtape.146929.html|title=Meek Mill - Mr. Philadelphia // Free Mixtape|work=[[DatPiff]]|publisher=Idle Media Inc|date=August 22, 2010|access-date=April 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423121310/http://www.datpiff.com/Meek-Mill-Mr-Philadelphia-mixtape.146929.html|archive-date=April 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to Mill and T.I.'s respective legal troubles, Mill was never able to release an official album under Grand Hustle and they parted ways in 2010.<ref name="grandhustle">{{cite magazine|last=Ramirez|first=Erika|title=T.I.

In May 2013, Mill was again found to have violated his probation and ordered to take etiquette classes.

On July 24, 2019, the [[Superior Court of Pennsylvania]] granted Mill's appeal, overturning his 2008 conviction and ordering a new trial to be overseen by another judge other than Judge Brinkley. In a statement, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office said it was pleased that the appeals court "validated our position that Robert Rihmeek Williams deserves a new trial before a court that has no appearance of partiality." However, the D.A. declined comment on its plans for a new trial, stating the office was weighing its options before proceeding.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McLaughlin |first1=Eliott C. |title=Meek Mill to get new trial and judge, Pennsylvania appeals court rules |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/us/meek-mill-granted-new-trial/index.html |access-date=August 16, 2019 |publisher=CNN |date=July 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816031236/https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/us/meek-mill-granted-new-trial/index.html |archive-date=August 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== 2018: Allegations of federal corruption ====
Reports alleged that there was an FBI investigation into the conduct of Brinkley, the judge presiding over his case.

In February 2018, the officer of Mill's original 2007 case was brought under scrutiny for the potential mishandling of his arrest.

== Controversies ==
=== "Amen" ===
Following the release of the lead single for ''Dreams & Nightmares'', entitled "[[Amen (Meek Mill song)|Amen]]", Philadelphia area pastor Rev. Jomo K. Johnson called for a boycott of Mill due to the song's lyrical content. "As a hip-hop fan, I want to encourage every rap fan in Philadelphia who is a believer in Jesus Christ, to boycott Meek Mill until he acknowledges this blatant disrespect. And being a resident of North Philadelphia and a pastor, I revoke Meek's 'hood pass' until this happens," Johnson said in a statement.

On July 17, 2012, in an interview on the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] show ''[[106 & Park]]'', Mill stated, "I don't think no preacher or no church approves of any type of rap music—because rap music, period, is a lot of bad stuff said. But at the end of the day, it's real life.

====Cassidy====
A feud started between Meek Mill and fellow Philadelphia-born rapper [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]], when Mill offered to [[rap battle|battle]] several underground rappers including Cassidy.

====Drake====
In July 2015, Meek Mill publicly criticized [[Canada|Canadian]] Toronto-based entertainer [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] on [[Twitter]], calling him out for not writing his own lyrics. In a series of tweets, the rapper claimed his counterpart used a [[ghostwriter]] for "[[R.I.C.O. (song)|R.I.C.O.]]", a song off Mill's second album, ''[[Dreams Worth More Than Money]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meek Mill Disses Drake, Jay Z, (& Others), Comes For Safaree|url=http://spacedoutmagazine.com/2015/07/21/meek-mill-disses-drake-jay-z-others-comes-for-safaree/|website=Spacedoutmagazine.com|publisher=SOM Media Network|access-date=July 22, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722152019/http://spacedoutmagazine.com/2015/07/21/meek-mill-disses-drake-jay-z-others-comes-for-safaree/|archive-date=July 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He also admitted that he was upset that Drake did not promote the album on Twitter, upon its release. "Stop comparing [me to] Drake. He don't write his own raps.

Meek Mill's claims received support from [[Funkmaster Flex]], an American hip hop DJ on New York City's [[Hot 97]] radio station.

On July 25, 2015, Drake premiered a track, titled "[[Charged Up]]" on the Beats 1 OVO Radio Show that is widely seen as a response to Meek Mill's allegations. Drake highlighted Meek Mill's relatively low sales volume and further claimed that the rapper was fading into obscurity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/07/26/drake-responds-to-meek-mill-on-new-track-charged-up/ |title=Drake Responds To Meek Mill On New Track "Charged Up" |publisher=BallerStatus.com |date=July 26, 2015 |access-date=July 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727010205/http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/07/26/drake-responds-to-meek-mill-on-new-track-charged-up/ |archive-date=July 27, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/7445948 |title=Drake "Charged Up" Lyrics |publisher=Genius |date=July 26, 2015}}</ref> Drake also dissed Funkmaster Flex by promoting his rival [[DJ Clue?]].

Mill's dispute with AR-Ab ensued after the former's rival, Drake, referenced the latter on his song "Back to Back", saying, "I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at? I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-Ab." AR-Ab appeared on VladTV in August 2015, said he had not signed to Drake's [[OVO Sound]], and sided with him. He was also disappointed at Mill's response, since he called out AR-Ab on "Wanna Know", the response to Drake's diss track. On August 6, during a performance at the [[BB&T Pavilion]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]], Mill responded, "fuck AR-Ab" and questioned his allegiance to an out-of-town rapper. AR-Ab responded by releasing his own version of "Back to Back" on August 8, which disses Mill and also contains violent lyrics threatening to unleash his "shooters" on Mill.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.musictimes.com/articles/45014/20150808/ar-ab-drops-violent-diss-against-meek-mill-raps-drake-track.htm|title= AR-Ab Drops Violent Diss Against Meek Mill, Raps Over Drake's "Back 2 Back"|last= Walker|first= Angus|journal= Music Times|date= August 8, 2015|access-date= February 12, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160215115100/http://www.musictimes.com/articles/45014/20150808/ar-ab-drops-violent-diss-against-meek-mill-raps-drake-track.htm|archive-date= February 15, 2016|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://www.complex.com/music/2015/08/philly-rapper-arab-disses-meek-mill-over-drakes-back-to-back|title= Philly Rapper AR-Ab Disses Meek Mill Over Drake's "Back To Back"|last= Balfour|first= Jay|magazine= [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date= August 7, 2015|access-date= February 12, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160216035336/http://www.complex.com/music/2015/08/philly-rapper-arab-disses-meek-mill-over-drakes-back-to-back|archive-date= February 16, 2016|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/08/ar-ab-sides-with-drake-blasts-fellow-philly-guy-meek-mill-on-diss-track-back-to-back-freestyle.html|title= AR-Ab Sides With Drake, Threatens To Unleash 'Shooters' On Meek Mill In New Diss Track|last= Stern|first= Marlow|website= [[The Daily Beast]]|date= August 7, 2015|access-date= February 12, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160216230103/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/08/ar-ab-sides-with-drake-blasts-fellow-philly-guy-meek-mill-on-diss-track-back-to-back-freestyle.html|archive-date= February 16, 2016|url-status= live}}</ref> In response, Meek's cousin and Dream Chasers signee Omelly released his own version of "Back to Back" that dissed AR-Ab.

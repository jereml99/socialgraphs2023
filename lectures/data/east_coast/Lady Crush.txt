==Career==
Lady Crush made her rapping debut in 1984 when she won a citywide radio contest, gaining a guest appearance on Tim Greene's single "The Facts of Life" (Importe/12, SugarScoop Records).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://collectorsfrenzy.com/details/171048372962/Lady_Crush__DJ_Jazz__MC_Perpetrators_12__KAM_Executive__Electro_Rap_SEALED|title=CollectorsFrenzy – Lady Crush & DJ Jazz – MC Perpetrators 12" – KAM Executive – Electro Rap SEALED|website=collectorsfrenzy.com|access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> The song later received mainstream recognition when the late famed remixer [[C.O.D.

=== Early career ===
In the late 1970s, he met [[Kool Moe Dee]] and DJ Easy Lee. Special K joined with other rappers Kool Moe Dee and L.A.

In 1981, they moved to [[Sugar Hill Records (hip hop label)|Sugar Hill Records]] along with another Enjoy Records act [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]]. The Treacherous Three became well known for their singles "Feel the Heartbeat" and "Whip It". They released their debut full-length album and were featured in the 1984 film the [[Breakdancing|breakdance]] cult-movie ''[[Beat Street]]'' performing the song "Xmas Rap" with [[Doug E.

'''Gene Elliott Thornton Jr.''' (born August 18, 1973), better known by his stage name '''No Malice''' (formerly known as '''Malicious''' and later '''Malice'''), is an American rapper from [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. He is best known for being one half of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo [[Clipse]], alongside his brother and fellow rapper [[Pusha T]]. No Malice released his solo debut album ''[[Hear Ye Him]]'', in 2013, and his second studio album, ''Let the Dead Bury the Dead'', in 2017.

==Life and career==
===1973&ndash;2009: Early life and Clipse===
No Malice was born Gene Elliott Thornton Jr. on August 18, 1973, in [[The Bronx]] borough of New York City.<ref name="allmusic" /> He and his family later moved down south to [[Virginia Beach]].<ref name="pitchfork1">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6551-clipse/|title=Interviews: Clipse|last=Maher|first=Dave|date=February 26, 2007|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=July 30, 2013|archive-date=October 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002192930/http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6551-clipse/|url-status=live}}</ref> He and his brother, [[Pusha T]], formed the [[rap group]] Clipse in 1992, and later were introduced to fellow Virginian [[Pharrell Williams]], one half of the high-profile production team [[The Neptunes]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Impressed with their lyrical talents, Williams formed a working relationship with the duo.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> He eventually helped them secure a recording contract with [[Elektra Records]], in 1997.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Under Elektra, and with [[The Neptunes]] handling its production, Clipse recorded their debut album ''[[Exclusive Audio Footage]]''. The group's debut single "The Funeral", helped to generate fan interest in the album, but failed to make a significant commercial impact.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> With "The Funeral" deemed a failure, ''Exclusive Audio Footage'' itself was shelved indefinitely. Clipse were subsequently released from their recording contract shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web | last = Brackett| first = Nathan | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/clipse/articles/story/5938804/new_faces_the_clipse | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071114072658/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/clipse/articles/story/5938804/new_faces_the_clipse | url-status = dead | archive-date = November 14, 2007 | title = New Faces: The Clipse | publisher = Rolling Stone| access-date = July 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Reid | first = Shaheem | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1454978/20020603/clipse.jhtml | title = The Clipse Emerge | publisher = MTV | access-date = July 31, 2008 | archive-date = December 29, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101229155127/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1454978/20020603/clipse.jhtml | url-status = live }}</ref>

In early 2001, Williams signed the duo to [[Arista Records]], through his recently established [[Star Trak Entertainment]] imprint.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Clipse released their commercial debut ''[[Lord Willin']]'', on August 20, 2002.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> The album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on ''Billboard'''s Top R&B/Hip-hop Album chart and No.&nbsp;4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], fueled by the strength of the lead singles "[[Grindin']]" and "[[When the Last Time]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;30 and No.&nbsp;19 respectively, on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> The album's third single "[[Ma, I Don't Love Her]]" (featuring [[Faith Evans]]), was a modest hit, reaching No.&nbsp;86 on the Hot 100.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> On October 1, 2002—only a month after its release—''[[Lord Willin']]'' was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name="Reference 1">{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=1239|title=Clipse Strike Gold, Neptunes Want To Go Country|format=Online news article|work=AllHipHop.com|access-date=June 11, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506010520/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=1239 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=May 6, 2006}}</ref>

In late 2003, Clipse began recording material for its second album, ''[[Hell Hath No Fury (Clipse album)|Hell Hath No Fury]]''.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> However, further work on the album ground to a halt in 2004, when [[Arista Records]]'s urban artists were absorbed into its sister label [[Jive Records]] as part of a larger merger between [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Due to contractual requirements, Clipse was forced to stay on Jive, while Star Trak and the rest of its roster moved to a new home at [[Interscope Records]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> While Clipse resumed work on the album, and eventually finished its recording, the duo became increasingly frustrated with Jive, as the label overlooked it in favor of the more [[pop (music)|pop]]-oriented acts on its roster, which caused numerous delays in the release of ''[[Hell Hath No Fury (Clipse album)|Hell Hath No Fury]]''.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> As delays continued, the group asked for a formal release from its contract. When Jive refused to grant this request, the duo sued the label.<ref name="pitchfork1"/>

On May 9, 2006, Clipse finally reached an agreement with [[Jive Records]] to release the album through its own label, [[Re-Up Records]], along with Jive.<ref name="Reference 2">{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5650|title=Clipse Tour With Ice Cube; Album Release Date Set|format=Online news article|work=AllHipHop.com|access-date=June 11, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521025035/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5650 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=May 21, 2006}}</ref> ''Hell Hath No Fury'' was finally released on November 28, 2006.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> It spawned two singles: "[[Mr. Me Too]]" with [[Pharrell Williams]] and "[[Wamp Wamp (What It Do)]]" with [[Slim Thug]].<ref name="pitchfork1"/> While the album received a great deal of critical acclaim, its sales were modest, at 78,000 in the first week.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> The [[hip hop]] magazine ''[[XXL magazine|XXL]]'' gave the album a "XXL" rating, marking it as a five-star album. At the time only five albums had previously received that honor.<ref name="pitchfork1"/> In a May 19, 2007 interview with ''[[Eye Weekly]]'', Clipse revealed that the group had been officially released from its recording contract with Jive.<ref name="Reference 3">{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_05.17.07/music/feature.php|title=Keys Open Doors|format=Print interview|work=Eye Weekly|access-date=May 22, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000821/http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_05.17.07/music/feature.php|archive-date=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After this, the duo began discussions with several record labels, eventually signing with [[Columbia Records]] on October 26, 2007.<ref name="Reference 5">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047652/exclusive-the-clipse-signs-with-columbia|title=The Clipse Signs With Columbia|format=Online news article|work=Billboard.com|access-date=October 26, 2007|archive-date=May 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528050026/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047652/exclusive-the-clipse-signs-with-columbia|url-status=live}}</ref> The follow-up to ''Hell Hath No Fury'', titled ''[[Til the Casket Drops (Clipse album)|Til the Casket Drops]]'', was released on December 8, 2009 via Columbia Records.<ref name="Release Date">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=52393|title=CLIPSE to drop casket in October|work=xxlmag.com|access-date=July 24, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092557/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=52393|archive-date=July 23, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In a departure from the group's previous works, which only featured production from the Neptunes, the album features production from [[Sean "Diddy" Combs]]' production team [[The Hitmen (production team)|The Hitmen]], and [[DJ Khalil]] among others.

On March 6, 2012, he announced that he changed his name from Malice to No Malice via a video posted to [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/502870/clipses-malice-changes-name-to-no-malice |title=Clipse's Malice Changes Name To 'No Malice' |publisher=Billboard |access-date=July 30, 2013 |archive-date=May 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005048/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/502870/clipses-malice-changes-name-to-no-malice |url-status=live }}</ref> It depicted No Malice viewing himself in a casket in a funeral parlor and walking away. The video, which was directed by No Malice, opens with multiple quotes from the Bible: first, from [[Ephesians]] 4:31, "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice;" then, from 1 Peter 2:1, "Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings;" and Romans 1:29, "Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers;" and Colossians 3:8, "But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vimeo.com/38040132 |title=No Malice |publisher=Vimeo |date=2012 |access-date=July 14, 2018 |archive-date=February 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202215212/https://vimeo.com/38040132 |url-status=live }}</ref>

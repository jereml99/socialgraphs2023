''Yahoo!''. April 28, 2019.</ref>

Jin became a [[Born again|born again Christian]] in 2008.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://world.wng.org/2013/03/rapper_rebirth|title=Rapper rebirth|last=Fulton|first=Angela Lu|date=March 8, 2013|website=[[World (magazine)|World]]|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> He was converted by Chinese American pastor [[Jaeson Ma]].<ref name="MCJinRebranded" /> He has since released several [[Gospel music|gospel]] themed projects expressing his faith.<ref name=":4" />

During the [[2008 United States presidential election]], Jin expressed his support for [[Barack Obama]]. Proceeds from his song "Open Letter to Obama" were donated to Obama's campaign.<ref name=":0" /> In 2019, he announced on Twitter that he was officially endorsing presidential candidate [[Andrew Yang]] in the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]]. He has released two songs supporting Yang: "Drew Yang Gang, That's Who I Hooked Up Wit'" and "#8MileYang".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://radiichina.com/mc-jin-drops-yang-gang-diss-track-against-the-entire-institution-of-us-presidential-election/|title=MC Jin Drops "Yang Gang" Dis Track Against the Entire Institution of US Presidential Election|last=Kohnhorst|first=Adan|date=2019-09-23|website=Radii|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> Jin also toured with Andrew Yang's campaign events.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} In April 2021, he released “Yang for New York,” a song and video in support of Andrew Yang’s run for mayor of New York City.

==Catchphrases and fan culture==
Jin's catchphrase is "Aiya!"<ref name=":3" /> ({{lang|yue|哎吔}}), a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] interjection roughly equivalent to "Oh my gosh!"{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}}. Fans pictured with the logo were able to appear in the music video for his song "Aiya!" (featuring Toestah).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhR27kTWiso Jin-Aiya (featuring Toestah) MV]. YouTube</ref> Jin also refers to his fans as his "AIYAfambam".{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

After his success and popularity on the Rap of China, Jin gained widespread respect and popularity throughout China, and also with the Chinese people worldwide. A China fanbase is secure with an official account on Weibo "MCJin欧阳靖全国粉丝后援会" <ref>{{cite web |title=MCJin欧阳靖全国粉丝后援会 |url=https://weibo.com/u/6321694059 |website=Weibo}}</ref> on August 12, 2017. Jin then officially named his Chinese fans "不帥團隊"<ref>{{cite web |title=不帅团队 |url=https://weibo.com/u/6299573351 |website=Weibo}}</ref> (Team Bu-shuai), a name which he came up with due to the focus on looks-oriented artists. Bu-Shuai means 'not handsome' in Mandarin, and Jin joked with his fans that although he is not handsome as compared to many artists, he is proud to be so as he is secure in himself as an 'un-handsome'. The official slogan for Team Bu-shuai is "生活愉快、越來不帥", which means to live joyfully and become more and more 'un-handsome'. A series of official Team Bu=shuai merchandise such as tees, hoodies, windbreakers, and caps donning the slogan and team name (designed by Jin) is also available on Taobao.<ref>{{cite web |title=SOUNDSGOOD |url=https://sounds-good.taobao.com/?spm=a1z10.1-c.0.0.6a271e9aisxHR3 |website=Taobao}}</ref> Jin also released the song "不帥"<ref>{{cite web |title=不帥 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNYrz8KBNJ4 |website=Youtube}}</ref> with an official music video made by him and Team Bu-shuai. The song talks about the special relationship between Jin and his beloved Team Bu-Shuai, promoting the slogan "生活愉快、越來不帥". The fanbase 'Team Bu-shuai' has an official account on Weibo,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://weibo.com/u/6299573351|title=不帥團隊|website=Weibo}}</ref> with over 55,000 followers.

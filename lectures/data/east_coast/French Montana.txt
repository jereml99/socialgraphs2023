== Career ==

=== 2002–2010: Cocaine City Records ===
French Montana began his career as a [[battle rap]]per in his teens under the name Young French. In 2002, French and close friend Cams created a series of street DVDs called ''Cocaine City'', drawing inspiration from the ''Smack'' DVD series popular at the time.<ref name="ComplexWIFM">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/01/who-is-french-montana2|title=Who Is French Montana? |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=January 2, 2012|access-date=March 26, 2012}}</ref><ref name="IndieHipHop">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiehiphop.net/how-they-came-up-the-french-montana-story/|title=How They Came Up: The French Montana Story|date=April 9, 2012|access-date=August 8, 2015}}</ref> The series featured interviews with major and upcoming rappers, personalities, and a focus on street music and hip hop beefs.<ref name=fader /><ref name="ComplexWIFM" /><ref name="RapFixLive" /> Initially as Young French, he used the DVDs as a means of showcasing his talent as an underground artist, including in it his own original music, freestyles, and collaborations with other artists. The first volume in the series featured [[Pee Wee Kirkland]] and [[Remy Ma]] among others.<ref name="ComplexWIFM" /><ref name="CombatJack1" /> What started out as a medium for developing an audience, quickly grew into one of the top-selling street DVDs.<ref name="IndieHipHop" /> The series ran for eight years between 2002 and 2010, totaling 14 volumes, and multiple spinoff films. Based out of the Bronx, French ran the series with the help of childhood friends including Brock, Droop Pop and Cheeze, who went on to become the first rappers that formed the Coke Boys.<ref name="HHVibeBrock">{{cite web|url=http://www.hip-hopvibe.com/2012/08/22/hhv-exclusive-coke-boy-brock-talks-the-blackout-2-and-history-with-the-coke-boys/ |title=Coke Boy Brock talks 'The Blackout 2' and history with the Coke Boys |date=August 22, 2012 |access-date=August 16, 2015}}</ref><ref name="HypeBrock">{{cite web|url=http://thehypemagazine.com/2014/07/the-hype-magazine-interviews-cokeboy-brock/ |title=The Hype Magazine Interviews Cokeboy Brock |date=July 15, 2014 |access-date=August 16, 2015}}</ref>

In 2003, French suffered a gunshot to the head when he was confronted by two armed gunmen as he was leaving a recording studio in the Bronx.<ref name="Life+Times" /><ref name="USmag" /><ref name="ComplexWIFM" /> The incident resulted in one of the gunmen dead, in what is believed to be a case of "[[friendly fire]]" by one assailant against the other.<ref name="Life+Times" /><ref name="CombatJack3" /> French was then hospitalized for several weeks.<ref name="ComplexWIFM" /><ref name="CombatJack3" /> Upon discharge, he discovered that he was set up by someone close to him and his circle.<ref name="Life+Times" />

In 2007, French Montana released his debut mixtape ''French Revolution Vol. 1'', which included collaborations with [[Uncle Murda]], [[Jae Millz]], [[Mazaradi Fox]] and [[Tony Yayo]]. The track "Quarter to Eight" was the first of many collaborations with [[Rick Ross]]. The [[J.Cardim]]-produced "Straight Cash" was French's first underground hit. In 2008, he released his second mixtape, ''Live From Africa''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisis50.com/profiles/blogs/784568:BlogPost:3080689 |title=French Montana – "Live From Africa" |publisher=ThisIs50.com |date= April 29, 2008 |access-date=February 22, 2016}}</ref> The song "Waavvy" was the first collaboration with rapper [[Max B]].

== Controversy ==

French Montana's career has been the subject of many allegations of [[sexual misconduct]] in the 2020s, the earliest of which date back years. Several women accused him of [[rape]], [[drug-facilitated sexual assault]], [[sexual battery]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[sexual misconduct]], allegations he denies, for which the [[statute of limitations]] either did not apply or had not elapsed, in nearly all cases. In March 2020, French Montana was accused of raping an [[unconsciousness|incapacitated]] woman at his former home in [[Hidden Hills, California]]. Montana was sued by a woman using the pseudonym ''"[[Jane Doe]]"'', for [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[sexual battery]], intentional infliction of [[emotional distress]], negligent hiring, supervision and retention and [[negligence]], in connection to a March 28, 2018, incident reported to police in which the woman alleged Montana drugged her and raped her while she was incapacitated on his bathroom floor. The suit alleged Montana "would sometimes without the women's knowledge or consent provide drugs to interfere with the women's ability to knowingly consent to sexual activity and had a longstanding practice of inviting women to his recording sessions, or choosing women at bars." Montana allegedly supplied women with drinks and drugs, "with the purpose of engaging in sexual acts with them, without any regard to whether or not they consented, or were able to consent." According to her court filing, "Kharbouch (French Montana) was one of the men who entered the room and sexually assaulted her". Doe reported the alleged rape to the police that same day and had a rape kit administered;  a subsequent police investigation showed the presence of semen.<ref name="The Independent">{{cite news |last1=Michallon |first1=Clemence |title=French Montana accused of sexually assaulting incapacitated woman |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/french-montana-sexual-assault-accusations-lawsuit-a9431106.html|access-date=January 7, 2022 |newspaper=The Independent UK |date=March 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Variety 1">{{cite news |last1=Maddaus |first1=Gene |title=French Montana Accused of Sexually Assaulting Intoxicated Woman |url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/french-montana-sexual-assault-1203546703/amp/ |access-date=January 7, 2022 |work=Variety |date=March 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name="XXL 50 Cent">{{cite web |title=50 Cent Reacts to French Montana Sexual Assault Accusation Read More: 50 Cent Reacts to French Montana Sexual Assault Accusation |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/50-cent-french-montana-sexual-assault-accusation/ |website=XXL Magazine |access-date=January 7, 2022}}</ref><ref name="Us Magazine">{{cite web |last1=Hautman |first1=Nicolas |title=F rench Montana Accused of Sexually Assaulting Intoxicated Woman in Lawsuit |url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/french-montana-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-intoxicated-woman/amp/ |work=Us Magazine |date=March 27, 2020 |access-date=January 7, 2022}}</ref><ref name="Oxygen">{{cite web |title=R apper French Montana Sued By Woman Who Claims He Sexually Assaulted Her During A House Party |url=https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/french-montana-accused-of-sexual-assault-during-house-party?amp |website=Oxygen |date=March 31, 2020 |access-date=January 7, 2022}}</ref>

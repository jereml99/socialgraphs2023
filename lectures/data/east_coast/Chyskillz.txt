==Career==
===Jam Master Jay===
Chyskillz started his music career deejaying for [[Large Professor]], the founding member of [[Main Source]]. Chyskillz working on a recording studio as an engineer and producer on Neek The Exotic's project. One day he met Fredro Starr, who saw him deejaying. Fredro liked his beats, so he gave him his phone number. [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]]'s manager, Jeff Harris, called him and invited him to [[Jam Master Jay]]'s studio. When Chyskillz got with [[Jam Master Jay]] his first professional credit was the remix he did for Fam-Lee – "Runs in the Fam-Lee".

===Onyx===
[[Queens]], [[New York City]] M.C. Neek The Exotic introduced DJ Chyskillz to the group Onyx in 1991. In Brian Coleman's book ''[[Check the Technique]]'' Fredro described how Onyx met their new producer:<ref>{{Cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QuOBbFeg0JIC&pg=PA303|title=Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies (by Brian Coleman) - page 305|isbn=9780307494429|access-date=2018-08-01|last1=Coleman|first1=Brian|date=March 12, 2009}}</ref><blockquote>"...We met Chyskillz on Jamaica Avenue one day. We was buying weed at the weed spot and Chy was chasing my truck down the street, yelling, 'I got beats!' His stuff back then was jazzy, on some Tribe Called Quest shit, but it was hot. I knew he could put beats together right away. We brought him into our zone and made him do some grimy shit."</blockquote>

When Chyskillz met Fredro and Sticky they were already signed to Def Jam. The group was called [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]] and consisted of [[Fredro Starr]], [[Sticky Fingaz]], Suave (a.k.a. [[Sonny Seeza]]) and [[Big DS]]. When Chyskillz first got with Onyx, they already have another producer, but their stuff was a little bit more commercial and friendly. Chyskillz let Fredro hear some beats and it started from there. Chyskillz began making beats for Onyx and the collaboration just worked. The first song that Chyskillz ever did for Onyx was "Nigga Bridges". He did one song for them and [[Russell Simmons]] heard it and give Onyx an EP deal for 6 songs. But they did 10 songs on a budget of 6 songs, so Russell Simmons give them an album deal.

Chyskillz and Jam Master Jay co-produced the hip-hop group Onyx's [[multi-platinum]] selling debut album called ''[[Bacdafucup]]''.<ref name=source/> The album is described as having a "tense, wired edge that amplifies the vividness of the threatening lyrics. Sonically, it has a hardcore [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast]]/New York City cast, full of throbbing bass and screeching siren-like effects".<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn = 978-0-87930-916-9| last1 = Woodstra| first1 = Chris| last2 = Bush| first2 = John| last3 = Erlewine| first3 = Stephen Thomas| title = Old School Rap and Hip-hop| date = 2008| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/oldschoolraphiph0000wood}}</ref>

Chyskillz drew notice for his work on hit songs like "[[Throw Ya Gunz]]" and "[[Slam (Onyx song)|Slam]]" by [[Jam Master Jay]] of [[Run-DMC]].<ref name=source>{{Cite web| last = Sanchez| first = The Lesson w/ DJ| title = Hip-Hop Legends Onyx Bac Up With New Album "Black Rock"| work = The Source| access-date = 24 April 2018| date = February 27, 2018| url = http://thesource.com/2018/02/27/onyx-bac-up-with-new-album-black-rock/}}</ref> Onyx's hit song ''Slam'', which Chyskillz co-produced with Jam Master Jay, was included in music writer Bruce Pollock's ''Rock Song Index: The 7500 Most Important Songs for the Rock and Roll Era''.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-135-46296-3| last = Pollock| first = Bruce| title = Rock Song Index: The 7500 Most Important Songs for the Rock and Roll Era| date = March 18, 2014}}</ref> It also made the [[Billboard Hot 100]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc.| last = Inc| first = Nielsen Business Media| title = Billboard| date = June 12, 1993}}</ref>

Chyskillz left Onyx in the summer of 1993 cause ''they don't need him like a producer record''. So Chyskillz signed with Wasteland Records.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/dropagemonem/2016/01/15/the-chyskillz-episode|title=4th and Long – Interview with Chyskillz on Blog Talk Radio (by Jermaine Hymes) (January 15, 2016)|website=blogtalkradio.com|access-date=22 February 2017|archive-date=August 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830230544/http://www.blogtalkradio.com/dropagemonem/2016/01/15/the-chyskillz-episode|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In May 2003 Chyskillz founded his own label "719 Music Inc.".<ref name=":2">{{Cite web| url= http://www.magcloud.com/browse/issue/932716|title=The Elite Men's Magazine of Hip-hop Culture. Issue#3 feat. Kurupt, Sly Boogy, NME (Brandon Davis) & ChySkillz (by Charles Purnell) (May 19, 2015)| website=magcloud.com |access-date=20 February 2017}}</ref>

==Musical style==
In an interview with [[NPR]], hip hop artist and record producer [[Large Professor]] described working with Chyskillz on one of his first demos:<ref>{{Cite web| title = Large Professor, Part 1: 'We're Living in the World of Hip-Hop'| publisher = NPR| access-date = 24 April 2018| url = https://www.npr.org/sections/microphonecheck/2015/07/29/424717271/large-professor-part-1-were-living-in-the-world-of-hip-hop}}</ref>
<blockquote>"...that's the style of production that we were doing at that time, where he would cut up "Synthetic Substitution" breakbeat on one tape. And you had the two and three tape decks, and he would put the tape in there. And then he would play that tape and overdub some bass lines."</blockquote>

==Last Year==
In the last year of his life, Chyskillz actively traveled by plane, now and then visiting the cities of Dallas (Texas), Atlanta (Georgia), New York and Miramar (Florida). In all the cities he had friends and there he found new clients – rap artists, for whom he produced music. On the Facebook he uploaded videos he shot at the airport, marked "Where in the world is Chyskillz now" so that his friends would try to guess the city in which the producer is located, leaving comments under the post. And in the video he used to say: "It's about catch a flight, I'll might be in your city".

==Death==
On July 5, 2017, Chyskillz was involved in a car accident and had surgery in October on his shoulder and was scheduled to possibly have back surgery soon. He was in a lot of pain and not working so much. He was in Queens, New York. On February 10, 2018 he was suffering a bad cold for two weeks and went to the hospital and they informed him that he had the flu, should never have gone to the studio and should have been resting. On February 12, Fredro and Sticky flew to New York. Fredro picked him up in Queens to go to the studio to do some remixing for the shows. Chyskillz was so pleased with this, he certainly agreed. After the session he came home late that evening around 2am. The next morning his family discovered him. Doctors say he suffered a heart attack. Next week he had to go to Miami, and then to Dallas for work. He just finished work on the project with De La Soul.<ref name="Vibe"/>

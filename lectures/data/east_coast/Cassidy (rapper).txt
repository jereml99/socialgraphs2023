==Personal life==
===Murder case===
On April 15, 2005, three men, including [[AR-Ab]] and Cassidy, armed with pistols and an [[AK-47]] assault rifle, fired on three unarmed men during an argument that occurred in the [[West Oak Lane, Philadelphia|West Oak Lane neighborhood]] in Northwest Philadelphia. Desmond Hawkins was killed by a shot in the back. Hawkins' two other friends were treated at hospitals for gunshot wounds and released.

On June 9, a warrant was issued for Cassidy's arrest on charges of murder, attempted murder, reckless endangerment, aggravated assault, conspiracy and weapons possession. Cassidy surrendered to Philadelphia police on the afternoon of June 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504319/20050617/cassidy.jhtml|title=Cassidy Turns Himself In On Murder, Weapons Charges|publisher=MTV News|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref> At his arraignment on Saturday, June 18, he was denied bail, and sent to Philadelphia's Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility, a high-security prison, where he would serve his time during the trial and after he was sentenced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504372/20050620/cassidy.jhtml|title=Cassidy Denied Bail, Booked Into Medium-Security Prison|publisher=MTV News|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref>

Cassidy's murder case took a turn when the primary witness withdrew his confession. This resulted in the judge stating that Cassidy would stand trial for [[third-degree murder]]. On August 16, 2005, Municipal Judge Marsha Neifield ruled that prosecutors had sufficient evidence to charge Cassidy with third-degree murder, attempted murder and weapons offenses. This was later overturned to the original, first degree charge - negating the possibility of parole. On January 25, 2006, Cassidy was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime for his involvement in the shooting. He was sentenced to 11 to 23 months in prison plus probation and was credited with the 7 months he had already served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1521478/20060124/cassidy.jhtml|title=Cassidy Convicted Of Involuntary Manslaughter — Will Be Eligible For Parole Soon|publisher=MTV News|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1509382/20050912/cassidy.jhtml|title=Judge Reinstates First-Degree Murder Charge Against Cassidy|publisher=MTV News|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref>

{{blockquote|"I was in a coma for about seven or eight days," he said. "And then they put me into a medicated coma, so that if I woke up I wouldn't be traumatized by what I went through. When I first woke up out of my coma, I had [[amnesia]], so I couldn't really remember everything. I didn't have full amnesia; I could remember certain things. The only people I really knew were my mom, my son, people that's real close that you knew all your life. I knew their names but even certain experiences I couldn't remember at first. I couldn't remember none of my raps, even the songs I performed — 'Hotel,' 'I'm a Hustla,' none of that. The doctor told me that I suffered brain damage, but it was temporary, it wasn't permanent. So the same way it takes time for your body to heal, he said it's gonna take your brain time to heal."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1573201/cassidy-talks-about-car-crash-fatal-gunfight-and-explains-why-hes-better-than-ever/|title=Cassidy Talks About Car Crash, Fatal Gunfight -- And Explains Why He's Better Than Ever|website=Mtv.comaccessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapbasement.com/videos/126875/cassidy-says-he-got-amnesia-from-his-car-accident.html|title=Cassidy - Says He Got Amnesia From His Car Accident |website=Rapbasement.com|access-date=December 6, 2016}}</ref>}}

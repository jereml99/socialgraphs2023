Smith began rapping at age 12. When his grandmother found a notebook of his lyrics, which he described as containing "all [his] little curse words", she wrote him a note on a page in the book: "Dear Willard, truly intelligent people do not have to use words like this to express themselves. Please show the world that you're as smart as we think you are". Smith said that this influenced his decision not to use profanity in his music.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Rowley |first1=Glenn |title=Here's How Will Smith's Grandmother Influenced His '90s Rap Lyrics |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/will-smith-credits-grandmother-influence-clean-rap-lyrics-8548111/ |access-date=March 28, 2022 |magazine=Billboard |date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=March 29, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220329075609/https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/will-smith-credits-grandmother-influence-clean-rap-lyrics-8548111/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===1985–1992: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince===
[[File:Will Smith - Emmy Awards 1993.jpg|thumb|Smith at the Emmy Awards 1993]]

Smith started as the [[MC#Hip hop|MC]] of the hip-hop duo [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince|DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince]], with his childhood friend [[DJ Jazzy Jeff|Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes]] as [[turntablist]] and producer.<ref name=tca>Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2002</ref> Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing his [[hype man]]. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.<ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Jazz Jeff Interview Made From Scratch |publisher=DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince Fan Site |url=http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/dj-jazzy-jeff/jazzy-jeff-made-from-scratch.htm |access-date=May 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516163814/http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/dj-jazzy-jeff/jazzy-jeff-made-from-scratch.htm |archive-date=May 16, 2008 }}</ref>

Soon after, the two decided to collaborate. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes aka [[Ready Rock C]], making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Records released their first single in 1986 when [[A&R]] man [[Paul Oakenfold]]<ref>[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C Paul Oakenfold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429072412/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C |date=April 29, 2008 }}</ref> introduced them to Champion Records with their single "[[Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble]]," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/ProfQuater/Jazzy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201090331/http://members.aol.com/ProfQuater/Jazzy.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 1, 2007|title=D.J. Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince|date=December 1, 2007|access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref> The song sampled the theme song of "[[I Dream of Jeannie]]." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.<ref name=sickening>{{cite news |title = Will Smith: My Work Ethic Is "Sickening" |publisher = CBS |url = https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/30/60minutes/main3558937_page2.shtml |access-date = May 14, 2008 |date = November 30, 2007 |archive-date = May 27, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527085124/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/30/60minutes/main3558937_page2.shtml |url-status = live }}</ref>

Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of [[Jive Records]] and [[Russell Simmons]]. The duo's first album, ''[[Rock the House (album)|Rock the House]]'', which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March 1987. The group received the first [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance]] in 1989 for "[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]" (1988), though their most successful single was "[[Summertime (DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince song)|Summertime]]" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.<ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince to reunite? |publisher=//URLFan |url=http://www.urlfan.com/local/dj_jazzy_jeff_and_the_fresh_prince_to_reunite/76504345.html |access-date=May 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707061753/http://www.urlfan.com/local/dj_jazzy_jeff_and_the_fresh_prince_to_reunite/76504345.html |archive-date=July 7, 2008 }}</ref>

Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.<ref name=tca/> The [[Internal Revenue Service]] eventually assessed a $2.8&nbsp;million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and [[garnishment|garnished]] his income.<ref>{{cite interview|first=Will|last=Smith|interviewer=[[Steve Kroft]]|title=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS|date=December 2, 2007}}</ref> Smith was struggling financially in 1990 when the [[NBC]] television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', around him.<ref name=tca/> The show was successful and began his acting career.

===1993–1997: Solo music and film breakthrough===
Smith's first major roles were in the drama ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'' (1993) and the action film ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' (1995) in which he starred opposite [[Martin Lawrence]].

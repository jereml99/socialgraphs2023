'''Gustav Elijah Åhr''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈoːr}}; November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017), known professionally as '''Lil Peep,''' was a Swedish-American rapper and singer-songwriter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/wjpd95/an-interview-with-lil-peep-from-september-2017|title=an interview with lil peep from september 2017|date=December 22, 2017|work=I-d|access-date=November 24, 2018|language=en-us|archive-date=December 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210041526/https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/wjpd95/an-interview-with-lil-peep-from-september-2017|url-status=live}}</ref> He was a member of the [[emo rap]] collective [[GothBoiClique]]. Helping pioneer an [[emo revival]]-style of [[Rapping|rap]] and [[Rock music|rock]] music, Lil Peep has been credited as a leading figure of the mid–late 2010s emo rap scene and came to be an inspiration to outcasts and [[youth subculture]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hobbs|first=Thomas|date=December 13, 2019|title=Juice WRLD, Lil Peep and XXXTentacion are symbols of a scene that trades off tragedy|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/wxeegn/juice-wrld-lil-peep-and-xxxtentacion-are-symbols-of-a-scene-that-trades-off-tragedy|access-date=June 18, 2021|website=i-D|language=en|archive-date=December 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229220809/https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/wxeegn/juice-wrld-lil-peep-and-xxxtentacion-are-symbols-of-a-scene-that-trades-off-tragedy|url-status=live}}</ref>

Born in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], to an American mother and a Swedish father and raised on [[Long Island]], Åhr started releasing music on [[SoundCloud]] in 2013 under the name "Trap Goose",<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8039377/lil-peep-career-timeline|title=A Timeline of Lil Peep's Career|magazine=Billboard|access-date=October 14, 2018|archive-date=April 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419000224/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8039377/lil-peep-career-timeline|url-status=live}}</ref> later changing his artist name to Lil Peep because his mother had called him "Peep" since he was a baby.<ref name=":13222">{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/a3dedg/first-date-lil-peep-interview|title=A First Date in a Cemetery with Lil Peep|date=June 7, 2017|access-date=June 22, 2018|archive-date=April 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404142734/https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/a3dedg/first-date-lil-peep-interview|url-status=live}}</ref> He soon became popular on the platform with the release of his 2015 single "Star Shopping", and his popularity grew further with his release of mixtapes ''[[Lil Peep; Part One]]'' and [[Live Forever (Lil Peep mixtape)|''Live Forever'']] later that year. In 2016, Lil Peep released his widely acclaimed mixtapes [[Crybaby (Lil Peep mixtape)|''Crybaby'']] and [[Hellboy (Lil Peep mixtape)|''Hellboy'']], along with many other projects including [[Lil Peep discography|''California Girls'']] and [[Lil Peep discography|''Vertigo'']].

Lil Peep's first live performance was February 12, 2016, in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] as member of Schemaposse. Later that year, he toured briefly with [[Fat Nick]], Mikey The Magician, and [[Smokepurpp]]. In the spring of 2017, Lil Peep embarked on his first solo tour, performing to packed venues in three Russian cities, making his way across western Europe, and then across the United States. Soon after the tour Lil Peep moved to [[London]], where he recorded his EP ''[[Goth Angel Sinner]]'', and in August he released his debut studio album, ''[[Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lil Peep Biography, Discography, Chart History|url=https://top40-charts.com/artist.php?aid=19884|access-date=June 16, 2020|website=Top40-Charts.com|archive-date=January 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210120232809/https://top40-charts.com/artist.php?aid=19884|url-status=live}}</ref>

On November 15, 2017, two weeks after his 21st birthday, Lil Peep died on his tour bus before a scheduled performance in Tucson, his second to last scheduled show on a 33-date tour of the United States. The [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] medical examiner's office, which conducted [[toxicology]] tests on Lil Peep, ruled his cause of death an accidental overdose of [[fentanyl]], a powerful [[opioid]], and [[Alprazolam|Xanax]], a [[benzodiazepine]] [[sedative]].

==Early life and education==
Gustav Elijah Åhr was born on November 1, 1996, in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], the second child of first grade teacher Liza Womack. His maternal grandfather is [[John Womack]], a former [[Harvard University]] professor of [[Latin America]]n history and economics and a specialist on [[Emiliano Zapata]], a leader of the early 20th century [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web | first= Quinn | last= Moreland | url= https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/lil-peep-everybodys-everything-documentary-review/ | title= The Lil Peep Documentary ''Everybody's Everything'' Is a Cautionary Tale of Modern Music Stardom | work= Pitchfork.com | date= November 14, 2019 | access-date=  | archive-date= January 13, 2023 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20230113220914/https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/lil-peep-everybodys-everything-documentary-review/ | url-status= live }}</ref>

Åhr's parents separated in 2012 when he was 15. He began experiencing [[anxiety]] around age 16 and, according to his mother, self-medicated with [[marijuana]] and [[alprazolam|Xanax]].<ref name="rollingstone.com"/> Lil Peep had a close relationship with his mother, going so far as to tattoo her initials and birthday on his arm as his first tattoo at the age of 14.<ref name=":13222"/> Following his parents' split, he moved with his mother and older brother to Long Beach, New York, where he would eventually record "[[Lil Peep; Part One]]", Feelz, Vertigo, most of "California Girls," "Garden," "In the Bedroom I Confess," "Mall Music," "Romeo's Regrets," and several tracks that were released as singles, including "Star Shopping".

Åhr attended Lindell Elementary School, located just across the street from his mother's apartment in Long Beach. Just a few days into Åhr's kindergarten year, the [[September 11 attacks]] took place with smoke plumes clearly visible from Åhr's kindergarten classroom. In third grade, Åhr was placed in Long Beach's gifted and talented program. Later, in middle school, he was placed in accelerated classes. He played the trombone and tuba<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2017/05/lil-peep-interview-the-break/|title=The Break Presents: Lil Peep – XXL|website=XXL Mag|date=May 19, 2017 |access-date=August 10, 2017|archive-date=August 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809165942/http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2017/05/lil-peep-interview-the-break/|url-status=live}}</ref> and expressed an interest in music and fashion from a young age. Åhr attended [[Long Beach High School (New York)|Long Beach High School]] in [[Lido Beach, New York|Lido Beach]], New York, which was directly impacted by [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012 and caused the school to close for a few weeks. When the school reopened, the faculty and administrators were more relaxed on the students, leading Åhr to enjoy his junior year of high school significantly more than the rest.

When Åhr returned to school the following year as a senior, there was a new administration that was unfamiliar with the student body and culture. An exhausted Åhr was ready to drop out, but was assisted by a teacher named Maria Hartmann to finish school. With the help of two other teachers whom Åhr knew and trusted, Åhr finished high school by completing his last two necessary courses, English and Social Studies. He graduated six months early in January 2014.

Later that January, Åhr was accepted into [[State University of New York at Old Westbury|SUNY Old Westbury]] on Long Island, but declined to attend and instead enrolled as an out of state student at [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. There, he was able to enroll in one class with a middle school friend, who ultimately dropped out. After his first semester at Glendale Community College, Åhr decided to drop out and instead enrolled at [[Nassau Community College]] on Long Island. By the fall of 2015, Åhr was taking four classes online (two business classes, one criminal justice class, and one art history class) in which he earned three A's and one B.

During Åhr's only full-time semester at Nassau Community College, he made the dean's list. However, instead of enrolling in a second term, Åhr decided to drop out and begin performing with Schemaposse. By the end of 2015 he had already completed a large body of work in his bedroom while attending school full-time.<ref name="Official Website of the Estate of Gustav Ahr / Lil Peep 2021">{{cite web | title=For the Record | website=Official Website of the Estate of Gustav Ahr / Lil Peep | date=February 8, 2021 | url=https://lilpeep.com/pages/for-the-record | access-date=March 4, 2022 | archive-date=January 13, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230113220919/https://lilpeep.com/pages/for-the-record | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":22">{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/wjpd95/an-interview-with-lil-peep-from-september-2017|title=an interview with Lil Peep from September 2017|date=December 22, 2017|work=I-d|access-date=October 23, 2018|language=en-uk|archive-date=December 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211220101130/https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/wjpd95/an-interview-with-lil-peep-from-september-2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":10">{{Cite web| url= https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/lil-peeps-mother-liza-womack-talks-about-her-sons-life-and-legacy/| title= Lil Peep's Mother Liza Womack Talks About Her Son's Life and Legacy| website= [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]].com| date= November 15, 2018| language= en| access-date= March 20, 2019| archive-date= February 27, 2022| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20220227101721/https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/lil-peeps-mother-liza-womack-talks-about-her-sons-life-and-legacy/| url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/interview-lil-peep-qzpqf068c|title=Interview: Lil Peep|last=Verrico|first=Lisa|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=August 6, 2017|access-date=November 16, 2017|issn=0140-0460|archive-date=November 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117070525/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/interview-lil-peep-qzpqf068c|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the age of 18, Åhr got his first face tattoo, a broken heart below his left eye, as a sign of commitment to avoiding a straight life.

===Wrongful death lawsuit===
The rapper's mother Liza Womack filed [[Wrongful death claim#United States|wrongful death charges]] against Lil Peep's management [[FAE grp]] in 2019, accusing them of "negligence and other breaches of contract which, the lawsuit alleges, contributed to his death in 2017 of an accidental drug overdose." Among the claims in the lawsuit are that FAE was complicit in providing access to "illegal drugs" and "prescription medications", and that the company knowingly allowed drug use to take place during the rapper's tour "despite being aware of his addiction". At one point, the lawsuit charges that FAE encouraged the star to take drugs.<ref name="CMU 2019">{{Cite web |url=https://completemusicupdate.com/article/lil-peeps-mother-sues-first-access-entertainment-over-rappers-death/ |title=Lil Peep's mother sues First Access Entertainment over rapper's death |website=[[Complete Music Update]] |last=Cooke |first=Chris |date=October 9, 2019 |accessdate=June 4, 2020 |archive-date=January 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210113175722/https://completemusicupdate.com/article/lil-peeps-mother-sues-first-access-entertainment-over-rappers-death/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In a responding statement, FAE expressed disappointment in the lawsuit:

{{blockquote|"Lil Peep's death from an accidental drug overdose was a terrible tragedy. However, the claim that First Access Entertainment, any of its employees, or Chase Ortega, or anyone else under our auspices, was somehow responsible for, complicit in, or contributed to his death is categorically untrue.

In the years following his death, Lil Peep became influential on the development of the [[e-girls and e-boys]] subculture.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Feng |first1=Victoria |title=What to Buy to Look Like: An E-Girl |date=March 3, 2020 |url=https://nymag.com/strategist/article/e-girl-style.html |access-date=December 24, 2020 |archive-date=November 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130210801/https://nymag.com/strategist/article/e-girl-style.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In addition to calling him "the future of emo", ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' also posited that Lil Peep's willingness to be vulnerable was an antidote to the toxic attitude towards women, which in the past has been a core element of hip-hop culture and its [[rap-rock]] variant.<ref name="Weiss" /> According to fellow GothBoiClique member, Fish Narc, Lil Peep explicitly rejected contemporary SoundCloud rapper XXXTentacion for his alleged history of [[XXXTentacion#Legal issues|violence against his ex-girlfriend]], spending time and money removing XXXTentacion's songs from his [[Spotify]] playlists.<ref name="Daramola" /> On the contrary, rapper Fat Nick, a mutual friend of Lil Peep and XXXTentacion, said on Twitter that right before Peep died, he and Peep had a conversation about XXXTentacion and had planned to meet up with him, and that XXXTentacion was "super happy about it".<ref name="hotnewhiphop.com"/> Fat Nick also spoke about the matter on an Instagram [[livestream]], where he dismissed the claims from Fish Narc and others about tension between XXXTentacion and Lil Peep, and confirmed that Lil Peep wanted to meet XXXTentacion once he was off tour. In the livestream, he also implied that members of GothBoiClique were responsible for Lil Peep's death, saying, "Some of y'all are siding with the people that took advantage of Peep. I don't get it... That's crazy. Y'all say shit about fucking X, but you're not saying shit about the people that killed [Lil Peep]... The people that gave him fentanyl.

Fish Narc responded on Twitter, "I feel that people think I am trying to insult X. But really I wish him rest.

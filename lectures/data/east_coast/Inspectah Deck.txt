'''Jason Richard Hunter''' (born July 6, 1970), better known by his stage name '''Inspectah Deck''', is an American rapper and hip hop producer. He is a member of the groups [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Czarface]].<ref name=HHDX_interview>{{cite web|author1=Micheal Variano|title=Inspectah Deck...Icon|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.370|website=HipHopDX|access-date=August 19, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730192648/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.370|archive-date=July 30, 2010|date=February 1, 2005}}</ref>

He has acquired critical praise for his intricate lyricism, and for his verses on many of the group's most revered songs.<ref name="20_dopest">{{cite web|title=DIGITS: The AllHipHop Top 20 Dopest Verses Ever!|url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/features/archive/2007/12/08/18844270.aspx|website=AllHipHop.com|access-date=August 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214011423/http://allhiphop.com/stories/features/archive/2007/12/08/18844270.aspx|archive-date=December 14, 2007|date=November 8, 2007}}</ref> He has grown to become a producer in his own right, taking up tracks for fellow Wu rappers and his own projects.

==Early life==
Hunter was born July 6, 1970, and grew up in [[Staten Island]], New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2010/02/big-pun-book-of-rhymes-vol-1/|title=Inspectah Deck speaks on Big Pun, Book of Rhymes, Vol. 1 |work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] |date=February 7, 2010 |access-date=June 26, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Allmusic_bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/inspectah-deck-mn0000770875/biography |title=Inspectah Deck Biography |website=Allmusic |author=Steve Huey |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Weinstein|first=Max|url=https://www.vibe.com/photos/20-things-you-didnt-know-about-wu-tang-clan|title=20 Things You Didn't Know About Wu-Tang Clan|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=November 15, 2013 |access-date=July 15, 2014}}</ref> Hunter routinely mentions the [[Park Hill Projects]] in [[Clifton, Staten Island]], where he grew up and went to school with  [[Method Man]], [[Raekwon]], [[Ghostface Killah]], and [[Remedy (rapper)|Remedy]].<ref name="newvoices2002">{{cite web|url=https://newvoices.org/2002/02/21/0146/ |title=Rhymes and Remembrance |publisher=New Voices |date=2002-02-21 |access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wuforever.com/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=69&page=1 |title=Wuforever Wu-Tang Community |website=Wuforever.com |access-date=August 19, 2010}}</ref> Hunter's father died when he was six years old.<ref name="halftime">{{cite web |url=http://halftimeonline.net/portfolio/inspectah-deck-wu-tang/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714050633/http://halftimeonline.net/portfolio/inspectah-deck-wu-tang/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 14, 2013 |title=Inspectah Deck (Wu-Tang) |website=Halftimeonline |date=November 10, 2004 |access-date=April 17, 2013 }}</ref>

== Career ==
Hunter developed a laid-back and quiet personality which he carried into his stage persona, as a low-key counterbalance to the antics of [[Method Man]], [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], and [[RZA]],<ref name="halftime" /> referenced by Method Man at the end of the track "Can it Be All So Simple?" on Wu-Tang's debut album ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'':

{{cquote|Inspectah Deck, he's like that dude that'll sit back and watch you play yourself and all that right? And see you sit there and know you lying; and he'll take you to court after that, cause he the Inspectah.}}

Despite this inconspicuous persona, Inspectah Deck maintained a relatively high profile, as he was the second most featured member on the album, and provided highly acclaimed verses for the singles "[[C.R.E.A.M.]]," "[[Protect Ya Neck]]," "Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit," and "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'." In the years following, Hunter would appear on several Wu members' solo projects, including Method Man's ''[[Tical (album)|Tical]]'' (1994), [[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…]]'' (1995), [[GZA]]'s ''[[Liquid Swords]]'' (1995), and [[Ghostface Killah]]'s ''[[Ironman (Ghostface Killah album)|Ironman]]'' (1996). On Wu-Tang's second group album, ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'' (1997), Deck produced the track "Visionz" and contributed a solo track, "The City", as well as writing one of the most critically acclaimed verses in hip-hop on the group's hit single "[[Triumph (song)|Triumph]]". He would also provide production for some of his Wu cohorts, including "Elements" and "Spazzola" for Method Man's ''[[Tical 2000: Judgement Day]]'' (1998), "Kiss of a Black Widow" for RZA's ''[[RZA as Bobby Digital in Stereo]]'' (1998), and the title track for GZA's ''[[Beneath the Surface (GZA album)|Beneath the Surface]]'' (1999).

=== Solo career ===
Inspectah Deck was originally supposed to be featured on the track "Got My Mind Made Up" by [[2Pac]] for his album [[All Eyez on Me]] along with [[Lady of Rage]], however both artists were cut out at Shakur's request. The song went on to feature [[Tha Dogg Pound]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], and Deck's fellow Wu-Tang Clan member [[Method Man]]. Despite his verse being cut out, he can still be heard at the end of the song saying "''INS the rebel''" before it fades out.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/ITuRQAsq8XM Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20190226031439/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITuRQAsq8XM&gl=US&hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITuRQAsq8XM| title = Tupac Took Inspectah Deck's Verse Off "Got My Mind Made Up" & Redman Never Got Paid For His Feature | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> His debut album ''[[Uncontrolled Substance]]'' was initially set for a 1995 release on [[Loud Records]], on which he signed for $650,000. But after Loud was acquired by [[Sony Music|Sony]], it was delayed and set to release in late 1997,<ref>{{Citation |title=Inspectah Deck Details Losing First Album to RZA's Flood |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF2mz215Ln0 |language=en |access-date=2023-02-11}}</ref> however, this experienced several additional delays due to a flood in producer RZA's basement studio, which destroyed over one hundred beats, including all of the instrumentals made for the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wutang-corp.com/news/article.php?id=227 |title=Cilvaringz: Wu-Tang Report :: news articles at Wu-Tang Corp. - The Official Site of the Wu-Tang Clan |publisher=WuTang-Corp.com |date=April 18, 2003 |access-date=August 19, 2010 |archive-date=December 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203051209/http://wutang-corp.com/news/article.php?id=227 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In September 1999, ''[[Uncontrolled Substance]]'' was released, and featured more of Deck's own production, and appearances from several lesser known affiliates. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, but failed to garner the reception attained by earlier Wu-Tang solo projects. Shortly after this release, Deck returned to the Wu-Tang fold for the group albums ''[[The W]]'' (2000), and ''[[Iron Flag]]'' (2001).

In 2003, Inspectah Deck released his second studio album, ''[[The Movement (Inspectah Deck album)|The Movement]]'', which he would later state did not live up to his expectations,<ref name=HHDX_interview/> and in 2006, he released ''[[The Resident Patient (album)|The Resident Patient]]'', intended as a prequel to The Movement. In 2007, the rapper reconvened with the Wu-Tang Clan to record the group album ''[[8 Diagrams]]''. Along with Raekwon, and Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck
partook in the [[8 Diagrams#Artistic disagreements|controversy]], sparked when several group members disparaged RZA's tight artistic control of the album, championing Ghost's album ''[[The Big Doe Rehab]]''. In regards to these disagreements, Deck stated in an interview:<ref name=hiphopgame_int>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=inspectahdeck3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310195219/http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=inspectahdeck3 |archive-date=March 10, 2009 |title=Inspectah Deck |website=HipHopGame |date=December 14, 2007 |access-date=August 19, 2010}}</ref>

{{cquote|I feel like we have to give them a newer, better album such as the new Ghost album. I’m not saying that’s the truth either. I’m just saying that his album sounds like what a Wu-Tang album should sound like, but it’s him by himself.}}

Around this time he announced two new projects: an album called ''[[Czarface (album)|Czarface]]'' as a new collaboration called [[Czarface]] with Boston's [[7L & Esoteric]] featuring the legendary [[DJ Premier]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.18756/title.inspectah-deck-and-7l-esoteric-join-forces-as-czarface |title=Inspectah Deck And 7L & Esoteric Join Forces As Czarface |first=Steven J. |last=Horowitz |date=February 21, 2012|website=HipHopDX |access-date=August 2, 2012}}</ref> and his up-coming solo album ''The Rebellion'', confirming production from RZA and the [[Wu-Elements]]; it is now set to come after ''The Resident Patient II'', and will reportedly be his final album as a solo artist.<ref name=hiphopgame_int/>

On March 23, 2010, Inspectah Deck released his fourth solo album ''[[Manifesto (Inspectah Deck album)|Manifesto]]'', which features guest-appearances from Raekwon, [[Cormega]], [[Termanology]], [[Planet Asia]], [[Cappadonna]], [[Kurupt]], and [[M.O.P.]]'s Billy Danze. In 2008, a mixtape entitled ''The Resident Patient II'' was leaked on to the internet; this features some original material, as well as freestyles over other artists' songs. Inspectah Deck stated in an interview that ''The Manifesto'' was meant to be the originally announced full-length sequel, ''Resident Patient II''.

Since early 2010, Inspectah Deck has begun work on ''Czarface'' and ''The Rebellion'', and has expressed his interest in working with several Wu-Tang members, as well as [[Snoop Dogg]], [[E-40]], [[Nas]] and [[Jadakiss]] on the album. He had mentioned in an interview with Conspiracy Radio that he will only retire from solo albums if the fans don't show support for ''The Manifesto'' and ''The Rebellion''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/eg/2010-02-27T09_14_19-08_00 |title=PodOmatic &#124; Best Free Podcasts |publisher=Conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com |access-date=August 19, 2010 |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715101357/http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/eg/2010-02-27T09_14_19-08_00 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He has also mentioned his plans to release an instrumental album of his own production, entitled ''The Bodyrock Volume 1'', which is inspired by the instrumental albums released by [[The Alchemist (musician)|Alchemist]], [[Ayatollah (producer)|Ayatollah]], and [[Pete Rock]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Paine |first=Jake |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1506/title.inspectah-deck-pawn-to-king |title=Inspectah Deck: Pawn To King |publisher=HipHopDX |date=March 2, 2010 |access-date=August 19, 2010}}</ref> On February 11, 2013, in an interview with HipHopDX, Inspectah Deck stated that he also has an upcoming album with producer [[Agallah]] in the works,<ref name=HipHopDX.com>{{cite web |last=Meara |first=Paul |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.2040/title.inspectah-deck-says-esoteric-is-up-there-with-eminem-czarface-is-a-friendly-duel- |title=Inspectah Deck Says Esoteric Is "Up There" With Eminem & CZARFACE Is A "Friendly Duel" |website=HipHopDX |date=February 11, 2013 |access-date=April 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014090003/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.2040/title.inspectah-deck-says-esoteric-is-up-there-with-eminem-czarface-is-a-friendly-duel- |archive-date=October 14, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and later confirmed during that year that he had renamed his "The Rebellion" album to ''Rebellion 2013''. He recently confirmed via Twitter that he has again changed the name of his final album to ''Uncontrolled Substance II'', a sequel to his debut album; that will be produced primarily by [[RZA]] along with The [[Wu-Elements]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/INSpectahDECKWU/status/354397357737115648 |title=Twitter / INSpectahDECKWU: After further review the ruling |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=2013-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/INSpectahDECKWU/status/354397535223291904 |title=Twitter / INSpectahDECKWU: @INSpectahDECKWU Yes RZA will |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=2013-07-11}}</ref>

After working with The Wu-Tang Clan on their sixth studio album ''[[A Better Tomorrow (album)|A Better Tomorrow]]'', he reunited with 7L & Esoteric for another Czarface album titled ''[[Every Hero Needs a Villain]]'', which was released in June 2015,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.33524/title.czarface-every-hero-needs-a-villain-release-date-cover-art-tracklist-pre-order |title=Czarface "Every Hero Needs A Villain" Release Date, Cover Art, Tracklist & Pre-Order |website=HipHopDX |date=April 21, 2015 |author=Cliff Grefe |access-date=May 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014626/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.33524/title.czarface-every-hero-needs-a-villain-release-date-cover-art-tracklist-pre-order |archive-date=May 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and again in 2016 for the third Czarface album, ''A Fistful of Peril'', after [[Marvel Entertainment]] reached out to them to record a track for their ''Black Panther'' web-series.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hahn|first1=Bryan|title=PREMIERE: CZARFACE IS BACK WITH A NEW ALBUM 'A FISTFUL OF PERIL' AND RELEASE "TWO IN THE CHEST"|url=https://massappeal.com/premiere-czarface-is-back-with-a-new-album-a-fistful-of-peril-and-release-two-in-the-chest/|website=Mass Appeal|access-date=27 March 2017|date=September 29, 2016}}</ref>

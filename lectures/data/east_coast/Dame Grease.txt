== Music career ==

Grease has produced several artists throughout his career. He has worked extensively with [[East Coast hip hop]] group, [[The LOX]]. Their use of Grease's sounds helped them acquire the street buzz that landed them their deal on [[Puff Daddy]]'s [[Bad Boy Records]] in 1996. Grease produced several songs on LOX's debut album, ''[[Money, Power & Respect]]'', including the hit ''[[Big Poppa|We'll Always Love Big Poppa]]''.<ref name="Strickland">{{cite web |url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2011/apr/12/rap-maestro-dame-grease-comes-off-slick-with-a/ |title=Rap maestro Dame Grease comes off slick with a hot new album |first=Khalid J. |last=Strickland |date=April 12, 2011 |publisher=Amsterdam News |access-date=February 9, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Harling">{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10857/title.dame-grease-to-serve-as-executive-producer-on-lox-album |title=Dame Grease To Serve As Executive Producer On LOX Album |first=Danielle |last=Harling |date=March 19, 2010 |access-date=February 9, 2014}}</ref> He was a producer on fellow Bad Boy artist [[Mase]]'s [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] album ''[[Harlem World]]'' (1997).

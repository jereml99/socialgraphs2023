== The Roots ==
The Square Roots renamed themselves the Roots and released their debut album ''[[Organix (album)|Organix]]'' in 1993. The Roots signed to DGC and followed up with ''[[Do You Want More?!!!??!]]'' in 1995. Recorded without any sampling, the album was more popular among alternative music fans than those of hip hop. Around the release of the album, the Roots performed at the [[Lollapalooza]] alternative music festival and [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. ''[[Illadelph Halflife]]'', the band's 1996 album, became its first to chart within the top 40 spots on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] because of the successful single "What They Do".<ref name="allmusic roots" /> ''[[Things Fall Apart (album)|Things Fall Apart]]'' followed in 1999, the year the band played at the [[Woodstock 99]] concert.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427531/19990712/costello_elvis.jhtml|title=Elvis Costello, Roots, Megadeth, Others Added To Woodstock Lineup|date=July 12, 1999|publisher=MTV News|access-date=March 3, 2009}}</ref>

== Solo music career ==
Black Thought recorded a solo album, titled ''Masterpiece Theatre'' and intended for a 2001 release,<ref name=Demby /> but the project was scrapped after he learned that the album would not count toward the Roots' contractual commitments. Most of the songs from the project ultimately appeared on ''[[Phrenology (album)|Phrenology]]''. In a June 2008 interview with Brian Kayser of the website HipHopGame, Black Thought spoke of another solo project that was scheduled for release on the Razor and Tie music corporation.

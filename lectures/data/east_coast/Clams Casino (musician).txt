== Career ==
A resident of [[Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey]], Volpe got his start in music tinkering with keyboards while he was a student at [[Nutley High School]].<ref>Olivier, Bobby. [https://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/2016/12/how_a_nj_beat_master_is_serving_underground_cloud.html "How this Nutley artist became New Jersey's latest music pioneer"], NJ Advance Media for [[NJ.com]], December 21, 2016. "The EDM bleed has paid dividends for Mike Volpe, a Nutley native better known as Clams Casino, who has become one of the most sought-after digital designers in hip-hop's experimental universe.... 'It's great, how easy it is to get stuff out, and make music at home and all the sudden people everywhere can hear it,' he says, from his home in Hasbrouck Heights.... The Nutley High School grad first began to tinker with beats as a teen, fooling around with basic keyboards and synthesizers, much simpler ones than the machines now scattered around his basement home studio."</ref>

Volpe's official debut EP ''Rainforest'' was released on [[Tri Angle (record label)|Tri Angle Records]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.philadelphiaweekly.com/music/2011/07/05/guide-to-new-music-7511-new-releases-by-clams-casino-exhumed-memory-tapes-and-pursuit-grooves/|title=Guide To New Music, 7/5/11: New Releases by Clams Casino, Exhumed, Memory Tapes, and Pursuit Grooves|work=Philadelphia Weekly|first=Elliott|last=Sharp|date=July 5, 2011|access-date=2014-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222234740/http://blogs.philadelphiaweekly.com/music/2011/07/05/guide-to-new-music-7511-new-releases-by-clams-casino-exhumed-memory-tapes-and-pursuit-grooves/|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> His ''[[Instrumentals (mixtape)|Instrumentals]]'' mixtape was released on March 7, 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xlr8r.com/news/2011/12/clams-casino-offers-instrumental|title=Clams Casino Offers 'Instrumentals' for Free|work=XLR8R|first=Shawn|last=Reynaldo|date=January 2, 2012|access-date=2014-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100544/http://www.xlr8r.com/news/2011/12/clams-casino-offers-instrumental|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> followed by the release of ''Instrumentals 2'' on June 5, 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2012/06/12/clams-casino-instrumentals-2/|title=Clams Casino: Instrumentals 2|work=Fact|first=Steve|last=Shaw|date=June 12, 2012}}</ref> and ''Instrumentals 3'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18830-clams-casino-instrumental-tape-3/|title=Clams Casino: Instrumental Tape 3|work=Pitchfork Media|first=Larry|last=Fitzmaurice|date=January 8, 2014}}</ref> The mixtapes were distributed for free through his website.

Volpe contributed a score for ''Locomotor'', a work choreographed by his cousin [[Stephen Petronio]] released in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/arts/dance/stephen-petronio-company-marks-its-30th-anniversary.html?smid=fb-share&_r=0|title=Come Here, Look Back, Move Forward – Stephen Petronio Company Marks Its 30th Anniversary|work=The New York Times|first=Brian|last=Seibert|date=April 4, 2014}}</ref> He released his debut studio album ''[[32 Levels]]'' through [[Columbia Records]] in 2016. He followed it up with his ''Instrumentals 4'' mixtape, released in 2017.

In April 2020, Clams Casino cleared the [[Imogen Heap]] sample for his instrumental "I'm God", which first appeared on Lil B's 2009 album ''6 Kiss''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=10 songs you need in your life this week|url=https://www.thefader.com/2020/04/24/best-songs-playlist-1975-earl-sweatshirt-charli-xcx-zsela-clams-casino|website=The FADER|language=en|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Clams Casino's legendary, Imogen Heap-sampling "I'm God" finally gets an official release|url=https://www.gorillavsbear.net/clams-casinos-legendary-imogen-heap-sampling-im-god-finally-gets-an-official-release/|last=Chris|website=GORILLA VS. BEAR|date=24 April 2020 |language=en|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref> The song remains his most popular, with over 25 million views on YouTube.

== Musical style ==
Volpe's music has been described as "[bringing] together conventional hip-hop drums, a sensitive ear for off-to-the-side melodies, and an overdose of oddly moving atmosphere."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Clams Casino: Instrumental Mixtape|url = http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15292-instrumental-mixtape/|website = Pitchfork|access-date = 2016-01-11|language = en-US}}</ref>

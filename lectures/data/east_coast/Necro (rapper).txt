Necro is a self-taught musician and has been playing instruments since the age of ten. He started producing hip hop beats in 1989 by [[Music loop|looping up records]] and bought an [[Ensoniq EPS]] in 1991.

=== Death metal influence ===
Since the inception of his rap career Necro has been influenced by the genre of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and more specifically [[death metal]], which has altered his path into hip hop. He has been quoted in interviews citing death metal as a key influence for his rhymes, [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s [[Death (metal band)|Death]] in particular.<ref name="brooklynvegan1">{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2011/04/metallica_slaye.html |title=Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth & Anthrax (The Big 4) playing Yankee Stadium!

Necro has said that he is heavily influenced by the thrash metal albums ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'', ''[[Reign in Blood]]'', ''[[Slowly We Rot]]'', ''[[Leprosy (album)|Leprosy]]'', and ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', and he has remarked that those albums take him back to "the '80s when shit was pure".<ref name="Death-Rapper NECRO To Make European Live Debut In London">{{cite web|title=Death-Rapper Necro to Make European Live Debut in London|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=November 27, 2006|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=62868|access-date=December 30, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916094320/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=62868|archive-date=September 16, 2007}}</ref>

Necro references heavy metal acts in his rhymes as well. For instance, on "Underground", Necro states he will "penetrate your skull like a riff from [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]]'s 'Slowly We Rot'" and quotes [[Metallica]]'s "[[Master of Puppets (song)|Master of Puppets]]" by saying "Taste me you will see / more is all you need / dedicated to / how I'm killing you". Over the years, Necro has increased his referencing and collaborations with underground metal acts, as evidenced by his 2004 album ''[[The Pre-Fix for Death]]'', which features many references and collaborations with heavy metal musicians from Obituary, [[Hatebreed]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], and [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]]. In addition, Necro created his own group known as The Circle of Tyrants, named after a song by [[Celtic Frost]]. ''The Circle of Tyrants'' album also contains collaborations with artists from [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]], and [[Sepultura]] as well as song titles named after '80s thrash metal songs such as [[Slayer]]'s "[[South of Heaven]]" and Metallica's "[[The Four Horsemen (Metallica song)|The Four Horsemen]]".<ref name="brooklynvegan1" />

In 2007, Necro toured with Sounds of the Underground. On July 25, 2007, he decided to leave the Sounds of the Underground tour. Necro commented, "I decided to leave the tour collectively with my manager and booking agent (both tour organizers) because we felt the tour's demographic was not receiving hip hop well. I was facing hostile, disrespectful crowds and had lots of glass bottles thrown at me. It was making a lot of people in the tour crew nervous and there was concern someone might get hurt (NOT ME). It was also being suggested that maybe I tone down my live show and not antagonize the already antagonistic crowd. I couldn't roll with that as it's not my style. I was holding back enough as it is but there is a line. All the bands on the tour loved us and everyone behind the scenes knew we displayed major heart and never once got fazed by the hostility. We finished every show according to our 25 minute time slot. I will make one thing clear for the haters: we NEVER got booed OFF the stage. Not once. Yes a ton of emo kids booed us at every show, but we had a twenty-five minute set every night and we stayed on stage for every minute of it, and we represented. Every show had at least 200 NECRO fans in the pit tearing it up, and our meet and greets were incredible! It's just a shame these little kids are so closed-minded. The majority of the hate was coming from mop top emo sixteen-year-olds who have no clue who the originators of metal are, and didn't respect my 'rest in peace' chant to metal legends ([[Dimebag Darrell|Dime]], [[Cliff Burton|Cliff]], [[Chuck Schuldiner|Chuck]], [[Denis D'Amour|Piggy]], Sob). As far as the tour organizers and I are concerned, you are my peoples so it's all love and I'm thankful for the opportunity to prove I can represent in a variety of situations. This actually did a lot for me and is just one move in many my team will make to blow NECRO up".<ref name="'Death' Rapper NECRO Leaves SOUNDS OF THE UNDERGROUND Tour">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=77552|title='Death' Rapper NECRO Leaves SOUNDS OF THE UNDERGROUND Tour|publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com|date=July 25, 2007|access-date=November 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013075941/http://roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=77552|archive-date=October 13, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Riot at Vancouver show ===
On Saturday March 21, 2009, Necro had an appearance scheduled at a Vancouver, Canada nightclub (Richards on Richards). When promoters announced that the show was canceled at the last minute, fans became violent and chaos broke out. People began to throw bottles at the venue's DJ (DJ Sage of the Vancouver hip hop radio show Urban Renewal Project).<ref name="Necro – Rapper Necro's No-Show Sparks Concert Riot">{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/rapper-necros-no-show-sparks-concert-riot_1098668|title=Rapper Necro's No-Show Sparks Concert Riot|publisher=Contactmusic.com|date=March 25, 2009|access-date=November 14, 2013}}</ref>

=== Perth incident ===

He pleaded guilty to the crime.<ref>{{cite news |title=US rapper Necro fined for Perth assault |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C27574%2C25593225-29277%2C00.html |access-date=2023-08-20 |work=news.com.au |agency=AAP |date=2009-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608162729/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25593225-29277,00.html |archive-date=2009-06-08}}</ref>

=== Ani Difranco ===
On May 18, 2010, Necro released ''[[Die (album)|DIE!]]'' On July 17, 2010, Necro revealed (through his website's forum) that he is being sued by [[Ani Difranco]] due to sampling her song "Used to You" for the track "The Asshole Anthem". iTunes and Amazon subsequently removed the album from their stores, and Necro re-released the album without this track included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.necrohiphop.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=144889#Post144889 |title=NECRO UPDATE – JULY 2010 – NecroHipHop.com Message Board |publisher=Necrohiphop.com |access-date=May 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309090534/http://www.necrohiphop.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=144889 |archive-date=March 9, 2012 }}</ref>

=== Inspiration in Tori Stafford's murder ===
On March 23, 2012, jurors in the [[Murder of Tori Stafford|Tori Stafford murder]] trial in London, Ontario, were presented with a connection between Necro's music and Tori's admitted killer.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tori Stafford trial aftermath: Religion and the death rapper |first=Kathy|last=English|work=[[Toronto Star|The Toronto Star]]|date=May 18, 2012|access-date=April 24, 2013|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2012/05/18/tori_stafford_trial_aftermath_religion_and_the_death_rapper.html}}</ref>

The court in the trial of Michael Rafferty heard testimony from convicted murderer Terri-Lynne McClintic that she listened to Necro the day she abducted Tori. Rafferty's defense attorney also noted similarities between the song "Garbage Bag" and letters McClintic had written when she was in a youth facility in 2007 and 2008; the letters described the hypothetical torture and murder of a person. At 5:12pm on April 8, 2009, the day of the murder, Terri-Lynne McClintic was positively identified as purchasing garbage bags. 8-year-old Tori Stafford had been found dead in a green garbage bag on July 19, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=McClintic planned Tori's abduction, lawyer suggests|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/03/23/stafford-rafferty-trial-friday.html?cmp=rss|access-date=May 15, 2012|newspaper=CBC|date=March 23, 2012|quote=The defence lawyer also played clips of violent-themed rap songs that McClintic once kept on her iPod, music the young woman admitted she listened to when angry. The songs were by a 'death rapper' known as Necro, the artist that McClintic once told police she was listening to on the day that Tori was abducted.}}</ref>

Necro issued a press statement on March 23, 2012, saying he does not support "anything that brings harm to children" and that he believes he has been unfairly blamed for the actions of some of his fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icontact-archive.com/4BdmjsXzjyfsGlIqfKiVxBizrP6fVkl0?w=2|title=Necro (Jewish Gangsters)|publisher=Icontact-archive.com|access-date=October 25, 2012}}</ref>

'''Kamaal Ibn John Fareed''' (born '''Jonathan William Davis''', April 10, 1970), better known by his stage name '''Q-Tip''', is an American rapper, record producer, singer, and DJ. Nicknamed '''The Abstract''', he is noted for his innovative [[jazz rap|jazz-influenced]] style of [[hip hop production]] and his philosophical, esoteric and introspective lyrical themes. He embarked on his music career in the late 1980s, as an [[master of ceremonies#Hip hop|MC]] and main producer of the influential [[alternative hip hop]] group [[A Tribe Called Quest]]. In the mid-1990s, he co-founded the production team [[The Ummah]], followed by the release of his [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|gold]]-certified solo debut ''[[Amplified (Q-Tip album)|Amplified]]'' in 1999. In the following decade, he released the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated album ''[[The Renaissance (Q-Tip album)|The Renaissance]]'' (2008) and the experimental album ''[[Kamaal the Abstract]]'' (2009).

As an actor, Q-Tip has appeared in various films such as ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'', ''[[She Hate Me]]'', and ''[[Prison Song (film)|Prison Song]]'', the latter of which he co-wrote and played the lead role. As a DJ, he has hosted the [[Apple Music 1]] radio show ''Abstract Radio'' since 2015. In 2016, Q-Tip was named the artistic director for [[hip hop|hip hop culture]] at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]], and in 2018, he became the instructor of a jazz and hip hop course at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts|Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music]].

===1988–1993: Early success with A Tribe Called Quest===

{{blockquote|Well, after I put out ''Amplified'', I was talking to [[Clive Davis]] [at Arista] about doing this album with the band.

So I did that, and I gave [the album] to [[L.A. Reid]], who wound up taking over. And he heard the album, really liked it, whatever. We started servicing it to press — and then he just got cold feet about it. He was saying it was really [[out of left field|left]] for him or something. So I then got a release from Arista, and I went over to [[DreamWorks Records|DreamWorks]] and recorded an album called ''Open''.

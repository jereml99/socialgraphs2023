== Career ==
Schoolly D teamed up with [[DJ Code Money]] in the mid-1980s. His lyrics reflected urban realism, violence, and sexual bravado.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> He was interviewed in the 1986 documentary ''[[Big Fun in the Big Town]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|2323202|Big Fun in the Big Town (1986)}}</ref> He later embraced an [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] style, bringing Afrocentric culture to hip hop along with [[KRS-One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429824/20000214/guru.jhtml |title=KRS-One, Schoolly D, Guru Tapped For "Once in the Life" |access-date=September 9, 2010 |last=Basham |first=David |date=February 14, 2000 |publisher=[[MTV]].com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011005041/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429824/20000214/guru.jhtml |archive-date=October 11, 2008 }}</ref>

Schoolly D contributed songs and music to many [[Abel Ferrara]] films, including "[[P.S.K. What Does It Mean?|P.S.K.]]" and "Saturday Night" (from ''[[Saturday Night! – The Album]]'') as well as "[[King of New York (song)|King of New York]]" to Ferrara's [[King of New York|film of the same name]] and the title track from ''[[Am I Black Enough for You? (album)|Am I Black Enough For You?]]'' that was played during the climactic shoot-out in that film, the title track from ''[[How a Black Man Feels]]'', and "Signifying Rapper" (from ''[[Smoke Some Kill]]''), which was used in Ferrara's film ''[[Bad Lieutenant]]''.<ref name="Tobias">{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22601 |title=Interview with Abel Ferrara |access-date=13 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211170233/http://www.avclub.com/articles/abel-ferrara,13793/ | archive-date=February 11, 2009|last=Tobias |first=Scott |date=November 27, 2002 |newspaper=[[The A.V.

Could use a source other than the Ferrara interview. --> of their song "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]" in "Signifying Rapper", the song was omitted from the soundtrack of the film and from subsequent releases of the film.<ref name="Tobias" />

Composer Joe Delia tapped Schoolly to co-write and record "The Player" for Ferrara's film ''The Blackout'', which Delia scored.<ref name="LarkinDM"/>  Schoolly also wrote the score to Ferrara's ''[['R Xmas]]''. In 2006, Schoolly D co-wrote the indie film soundtrack of the historical science fiction thriller ''Order of the Quest'' with [[Chuck Treece]]. The project series is produced by Benjamin Barnett, and Jay D Clark of Media Bureau. His last album, ''[[Funk 'N Pussy]]'', on Jeff "Met" Thies' Chord Recordings features guest appearances by [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s [[Chuck D]], Chuck Chillout, Lady B and a [[drum and bass]] remix of the classic Schoolly D track "Mr. Big Dick" (remixed by UK [[trip hop]] crew [[The Sneaker Pimps]]).

Schoolly also performed the music and occasional narration for the [[cult television|cult]] [[animated series]] ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' on the [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] programming block. He was a guest on a first-season episode of ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''. He also created the song "Sharkian Nights" for the Adult Swim series ''[[12 oz. Mouse]]''. The character Jesse B. Weaver from ''[[The Rudy and Gogo World Famous Cartoon Show]]'' was also named after him.

In November 2006 Schoolly D and Cartoon Network were sued over the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' theme music. A drummer by the name of Terence Yerves claimed he had also written the theme music alongside Schoolly D in 1999 while working at the Meat Locker Studio. Yerves was aware the song would be used for a television series but did not approve of it being used for ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'', however, did not file the copyright to the [[Library of Congress]] until May 2006, after the series' fourth season had already started airing. In the lawsuit Yerves demanded he receive $150,000 for every time the series was aired after the lawsuit was filed, he also demanded that all existing copies of the series' DVDs be impounded and for ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' to cease broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Kyle|title=Aqua Teen Hunger Force sued over theme song|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/aqua-teen-hunger-force-sued-over-theme-song,15851/|newspaper=[[The A.V.

On December 30, 2022 he released his newest album, ''Cause Schoolly D Is Crazy''.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

==Legacy==
Rapper [[Ice-T]], who is often given credit for the creation of [[gangsta rap]], discussed Schoolly D's influence on him in his autobiography:<ref name=IceCentury>{{cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/icememoirofgangs00icet }}</ref>

{{blockquote|The first record that came out along those lines was Schoolly D's "P.S.K." Then the syncopation of that rap was used by me when I made "[[6 in the Mornin']]." The vocal delivery was the same: "...P.S.K. is makin' that green," "...six in the morning, police at my door." When I heard that record I was like, "Oh shit!" and call it a bite or what you will but I dug that record. My record didn't sound like "P.S.K.," but I liked the way he was flowing with it. "P.S.K." was talking about Park Side Killers but it was very vague. That was the only difference, when Schoolly did it, it was "...one by one, I'm knockin' em out." All he did was represent a gang on his record. I took that and wrote a record about guns, beating people down, and all that with "6 in the Mornin'."<ref>{{cite web

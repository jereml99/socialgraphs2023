'''Oscar Jackson Jr.''' (born October 29, 1967), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Paris''', is an American rapper from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], known for his highly charged [[political]] and [[socially]] conscious lyrics.<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paris-mn0000003182/biography|title=Paris - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref> Influenced by the [[Black Panthers]], he was once a member of the [[Nation of Islam]].<ref name=SFNews>{{cite news | url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2003-12-03/news/capital-rap/ | title=Capital Rap | date=December 3, 2003 | newspaper=[[SF Weekly]] | author=Peter Byrne | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226192833/http://www.sfweekly.com/2003-12-03/news/capital-rap/ | archive-date=2009-02-26 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Biography==
===1990s===
Paris became known in the US in 1990 with the hit single "The Devil Made Me Do It" and [[The Devil Made Me Do It|album of the same name]],<ref name=LarkinDM>{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=257}}</ref> after earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[economics]] from the [[University of California, Davis]].<ref name="SFNews"/> Originally released on [[Tommy Boy Records]], his first video was banned by [[MTV]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Huey |first1=Steve |title=Paris |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/paris_rap_/artist.jhtml |access-date=2 February 2021 |publisher=[[MTV.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106232735/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/paris_rap_/artist.jhtml |archive-date=6 November 2011}}</ref>

When his second album, ''[[Sleeping with the Enemy (album)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]'', was ready for release in 1992, Paris was dropped from now-defunct [[Tommy Boy Records]] (since rechristened Tommy Boy Entertainment in 2002) and distributor [[Warner Bros. Records]], owned by [[Time Warner]], when the parent company discovered its incendiary content, which included fantasy revenge killings of then-[[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]] and racist police officers. Also problematic was the album's insert, which featured the artist waiting behind a tree, holding a [[TEC-9]], as the president was waving to the crowd. Paris eventually released the LP himself on his newly formed [[Scarface Records]].<ref name="LarkinDM" /> Also in 1992, Paris contributed to [[industrial music]] band [[Consolidated (band)|Consolidated]]'s 1992 album ''[[Play More Music]]'' with the track "Guerrillas in the Mist."

Paris signed a major artist and distribution deal with [[Priority Records]] for himself and Scarface Records in 1993 and released his third LP, ''[[Guerrilla Funk]]'',<ref name="LarkinDM"/> and several then up-and-coming groups, most notably [[The Conscious Daughters]]. Paris and Priority formally severed their business relationship due to creative differences in 1995, and in 1997, Paris signed a one-off deal with now-defunct Whirling Records (distributed by [[Rykodisc]]) for the release of his fourth LP, ''[[Unleashed (Paris album)|Unleashed]]'', which was released in small numbers with little promotion. The album contained some very explicitly violent and racially charged verses, and while less overtly political as earlier efforts, the lyrics explicitly describe racial violence when confronted with the same. Also released in Europe with a different track list, the album featuring songs from 1994, 1996 and 1998, some of which were more in the style of his earlier releases. Becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the [[music industry]], Paris retired from recording and worked as a [[stockbroker]], cementing his personal wealth allowing him to independently finance the next stage of his musical endeavors.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dow |first1=Danica |title=Ex-Broker/Rapper Paris Explains The Wall Street Melt Down's Affect On Hip-Hop |url=https://www.sohh.com/ex-brokerrapper-paris-explains-the-wall-street-melt-downs-affect-on-hip-hop/ |access-date=2 February 2021 |work=[[SOHH]] |date=1 October 2008}}</ref>

===2000s===
In 2003, Paris returned with the album, ''[[Sonic Jihad (Paris album)|Sonic Jihad]]''. The album continued his tradition of [[History of controversial album art|controversial cover art]], evoking images of the [[September 11 attacks]], it depicts a plane flying toward the [[White House]]. Its content is equally radical and covers many topics, including the [[War on Terrorism|war on terror]], the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], [[police brutality]], [[Race and crime in the United States#Terminology|black-on-black violence]], conditions in inner-city communities, the [[Illuminati]], and [[state-sponsored terrorism]]. Other [[Political hip hop|politically minded hip hop]] artists were featured on the album, including [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]], [[dead prez]], and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. ''Sonic Jihad'' was the catalyst for the creation of Paris' new label and web site, Guerrilla Funk Recordings, a home for projects and material of such notable acts as dead prez and Public Enemy.

Paris' anti-war anthem "What Would You Do?" (from ''Sonic Jihad'') accuses<ref>{{cite web |title=''SONIC JIHAD'' |url=http://www.guerrillafunk.com/paris/sonic_jihad/ |website=Guerrillafunk.com |publisher=Guerrilla Funk Recordings and Filmworks, LLC |access-date=2 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414012127/http://www.guerrillafunk.com/paris/sonic_jihad/ |archive-date=14 April 2015}}</ref> "[[9/11 conspiracy theories|the Bush Administration [of playing] a key role in orchestrating the terror attacks of September 11]]",<ref>{{cite web |author1=Paris |title=The War On Terror |url=http://www.guerrillafunk.com/thoughts/doc1241a.html |website=guerrillafunk.com |access-date=2 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327050036/http://www.guerrillafunk.com/thoughts/doc1241a.html |archive-date=27 March 2006}}</ref> saying, ''"Ain't no terror threat, unless approval rating's slumpin'. So I'ma say it for the record we the ones that planned it, ain't no other country took a part or had they hand in it".''  The song is featured on the 2004 compilation album ''Peace Not War, Vol. 2''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peace Not War, Vol. 2 — Various Artists |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-not-war-vol-2-mw0000715502 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2 February 2021 |language=en}}</ref> On the 2003 [[Anybody Killa]] album ''[[Hatchet Warrior]]'', Paris appeared with [[Monoxide Child|Monoxide]] on a track entitled "Ghetto Neighbor."

In 2005, Paris completed a project with [[Public Enemy]], ''[[Rebirth of a Nation]]'', the title both a reference to the 1915 film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', controversial for its glorification of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its racist portrayal of African Americans, and PE's 1988 album ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]''.  Although [[Chuck D]] was the primary vocal performer, Paris penned and produced the bulk of the album, which also featured [[N.W.A]]'s [[MC Ren]], [[Immortal Technique]], Kam, [[Dead Prez|dead prez]], and [[The Conscious Daughters]].

In 2006, Paris also released ''Paris presents Hard Truth Soldiers, Vol. 1'', the first in a Paris-produced compilation series that touched on subjects ranging from war and [[police brutality]] to black-on-black crime and [[domestic violence]]. It showcased contributions from Public Enemy, [[the Coup]], dead prez, Paris, T-K.A.S.H., Kam, The Conscious Daughters, [[Mystic (singer)|Mystic]], [[MC Ren]], [[Sun Rise Above]], and the [[Stop the Violence Movement]] ([[Mobb Deep]], [[Tray Deee]], [[Soopafly]], [[KRS-One]], Defari, Daz, [[J-Ro]], [[RBX]], [[Bad Azz (rapper)|Bad Azz]], [[WC (rapper)|WC]], [[Dilated Peoples]], [[Mac Minister]], [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], [[Mack 10]], [[Evidence (musician)|Evidence]], Defari, [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]], and [[B-Real]]), among others.

In addition, Paris introduced the world to former [[The Coup|Coup]]-member T-K.A.S.H. later that year, releasing his debut offering, ''Turf War Syndrome'', and handling production duties as well.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In 2007, Paris released the follow-up companion piece to ''Rebirth of a Nation'', the Public Enemy collaboration ''Remix of a Nation'', and began laying the framework for the film division of Guerrilla Funk Recordings.

Paris inked a distribution deal with [[Fontana Distribution|Fontana]]/[[Universal Music Group|Universal]] for Guerrilla Funk (with movies through [[Vivendi]]) in late 2007, and released his next album, ''[[Acid Reflex]]'', featuring [[Chuck D]] and [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], in 2008.

In 2009, Paris released ''Paris Presents: Hard Truth Soldiers, Vol. 2'', the sophomore project from T-K.A.S.H., ''Brains All Over The Streets'', and the latest offering from The Conscious Daughters, ''The Nutcracker Suite''.

Paris not only writes and produces songs, but also publishes information about ways to improve [[Inner city|inner-city communities]]. Numerous articles can be found on various subjects in the Thought Box section of Guerrilla Funk's website.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thought Box |url=http://www.guerrillafunk.com/thoughts/ |website=guerrillafunk.com |access-date=2 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124113910/http://www.guerrillafunk.com:80/thoughts/ |archive-date=24 November 2014}}</ref>

In November 2014, he released a video single, "Night of the Long Knives," which called for an increased [[Black-brown unity|unity in the black and brown communities]] and the adoption of the [[Eye for an eye|eye-for-an-eye]] philosophy toward racist police aggression and brutality in the wake of the tragedy in [[Ferguson, Missouri#Michael Brown shooting|Ferguson, Missouri]] and [[Lists of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States|other high-profile shooting deaths]].

In August 2015, Paris released his second video single, "Buck, Buck, Pass," a commentary on [[gun violence]], its often ignored racial implications and its after effects.

His album ''Pistol Politics'' was released on September 11, 2015. It was named one of the Best Hip-Hop albums of 2015 by [[Spin (magazine)|''SPIN'' magazine]]<ref name=SPIN>{{cite news | url=http://www.spin.com/2015/12/the-50-best-hip-hop-albums-of-2015/ | title=The 50 Best Hip-Hop Albums of 2015  | date=December 16, 2015 | magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]] | author=SPIN Staff }}</ref> and received an "A−" rating by ''[[Vice (magazine)|VICE]]''.<ref name=VICE>{{cite news | url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/expert-witness-with-robert-christgau-chance-the-rapper | title=Expert Witness with Robert Christgau  | date=September 25, 2015 |magazine=[[VICE (magazine)|VICE]] | author=Robert Christgau }}</ref>

'''Vernon Johnson''' (born December 24, 1970), professionally known by his [[stage name]] '''Tha Chill''', is an American rapper and record producer. He embarked on his music career in the early 1990s, as a co-founder of the [[Compton, California|Compton]]-based [[West Coast hip hop]]/[[gangsta rap]] group [[Compton's Most Wanted]], along with frontman Aaron "[[MC Eiht]]" Tyler. During his childhood, Johnson dropped out of high school and hooked up with neighbourhood friend MC Eiht, to form the group.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/184565-Tha-Chill|title=Tha Chill|website=[[Discogs]]|language=en}}</ref>

==Career==
===C.M.W.–1990s===
During the recording of the debut [[Compton's Most Wanted|CMW]]'s album, ''[[It's a Compton Thang]]'', Tha Chill was arrested for "[[Joyride (crime)|joy riding]]" but was released a few weeks later on [[time served]] and finished recording his remaining verses on the songs of the album. He had missed his appearance on the group's two following full-lengths, 1991 ''[[Straight Checkn 'Em]]'' and 1992 ''[[Music to Driveby]]'', because he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. However, he was subsequently a featured performer on the reunion album, ''[[Represent (Compton's Most Wanted album)|Represent]]'', which the group released after an eight-year hiatus.

After serving over 2 years in prison, Johnson, together with Gene "[[Boom Bam]]" Heisser, became members of MC Eiht's new group [[Niggaz on tha Run]]. Tha Chill heavily contributed within Killafornia Organization. Since 1998, he has been producing tracks for the likes of [[213 (group)|213]], [[Above the Law (group)|Above The Law]], [[Kokane]], [[MC Ren]], [[RBX]], and MC Eiht's solo efforts.

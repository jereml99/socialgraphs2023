'''Ash Winston Riser''' (August 29, 1989 – June 12, 2021),<ref name=death>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefocus.news/music/ash-riser-death/|title=RIP Ash Riser: Death of producer rocks LA music scene|date=June 13, 2021}}</ref> also known by his former stage name '''Ashtrobot''', was an American recording artist and music producer. Born and raised in California, he embarked on his music career when he was 15 years old, forming a rock band called Pistol Pistol (stylized P!stol P!stol). Due to differences between members, the band broke up in 2009 and Riser subsequently began to put his focus on music production, fusing [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[hip hop music]], among other genres. Riser later began working with longtime friend, [[Derek "MixedByAli" Ali|Derek Ali]] of [[Top Dawg Entertainment]], who introduced him to West Coast rapper [[Kendrick Lamar]], with whom he began heavily collaborating. Riser would go on to sign a record deal with Israeli music producer [[Borgore]]'s record label, Buygore and also had a production deal with Chest Rockwell Entertainment. During his life, Riser had played multiple sold-out shows with fellow label-mates and musicians such as ETC! ETC!, Kennedy Jones, [[Ookay]], Protohype and [[Dirtyphonics]]. In 2016, Riser received a [[Grammy Award]] for his contributions on Kendrick Lamar's ''[[To Pimp a Butterfly]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://soundbetter.com/profiles/273443-ash-riser|title = Ash Riser on SoundBetter}}</ref>

==Life and career==
Ash Winston Riser was born on August 29, 1989, in [[Redondo Beach, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ASHRISERMUSIC/posts/893257357368965|title=ASH RISER|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=August 26, 2020}}</ref> It was here he first encountered music and founded his rock band, Pistol Pistol (stylized P!stol P!stol), at the young age of 15. The band, which he formed with high-school classmates, initially started out as a [[cover band]], [[cover (music)|covering]] songs by [[Weezer]] and [[The Strokes]], among other bands.<ref name="TS">{{Cite web |url=http://www.trapstyle.com/2014/08/29/trapstyles-qa-with-buygore-dream-brigades-ash-riser/ |title=TrapStyle's Q&A with Buygore & DREAM Brigade's Ash Riser TrapStyle &#124; More Than Music |access-date=2015-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520144746/http://www.trapstyle.com/2014/08/29/trapstyles-qa-with-buygore-dream-brigades-ash-riser/ |archive-date=2015-05-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His first serious music project [P!stol P!stol], was a great success with appearances on ''The Drop'' on [[Sí TV]] and music featured on [[ESPN]]. During their time together, P!stol P!stol released an album titled ''The Cause''.<ref name="TS"/> However, due to differences between members, the band broke up in 2009.<ref name="TS"/> Since the break-up of his band, he decided to spend countless hours in the studio perfecting his style and sound, producing [[bass music]].<ref name="TS"/>

While focusing on music production after P!stol P!stol's disbandment, Riser got a phone call from his longtime high-school friend, Derek Ali, better known as [[MixedByAli]], the in-house [[mixing engineer]] of West Coast indie record label, [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] (TDE). Ali asked Riser to come by the studio and record vocals with an artist he was producing for named [[Kendrick Lamar]], a [[Compton, California|Compton]]-based rapper. Lamar and Riser had an instant musical synergy, with Lamar finding Riser's voice to be very original and complementary to his own. Lamar appreciated that Riser used his voice as a musical instrument to add more soul to tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uiXjaDf-bQ|title=Kendrick Lamar "co-signs" Ash Riser|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=August 26, 2020}}</ref> In 2009, Riser was featured on Lamar's debut [[extended play]] (EP), ''[[Kendrick Lamar (EP)|Kendrick Lamar]]'', on a [[bonus track]] titled "Determined". Lamar and Riser collaborated again in 2010, for Lamar's ''[[Overly Dedicated]]'' project, appearing on the song "Barbed Wire". In 2011, Riser was featured on Lamar's ''[[Section.80]]'' project, lending his vocals on the tracks, "Keisha's Song" and "Ronald Reagan Era".

In July 2011, Riser released an EP under his label, D.R.E.A.M. Brigade Recordings. The EP, titled ''21st Century Electric Church Music'', is a collection of songs compiled by different artists and includes Riser's song, "Ghetto Blastuh".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/21st-century-electric-church-music-ep/447830909|title=21st Century Electric Church Music – EP by Various Artists|website=Music.apple.com|date=July 4, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2020}}</ref> Riser then began collaborating with Lamar's [[Black Hippy]] cohort and TDE label-mate, [[Ab-Soul]]. Riser was featured on "Beautiful Death", from Ab-Soul's 2012 project, ''[[Control System]]''. In 2013, Riser signed a recording contract with Israeli music producer [[Borgore]]'s record label Buygore, as well as his management company, Buygore Management. Around that time, Riser also signed a production deal with Chest Rockwell Entertainment, founded by Greg Ogan and Spencer Neezy. On April 22, 2015, Riser released an EP titled ''Modern Medicine'', which he [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]], [[Audio mastering|mastered]], produced and recorded by himself.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bluntiq.com/2015/04/23/ash-riser-modern-medicine-ep/ |title=Ash Riser – Modern Medicine (EP) – BLUNTIQ |access-date=2015-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427085354/http://bluntiq.com/2015/04/23/ash-riser-modern-medicine-ep/ |archive-date=2015-04-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thecomeupshow.com/2015/04/28/mixtape-ash-riser-modern-medicine-prod-ash-riser/ |title=&#91;Mixtape&#93; Ash Riser- "Modern Medicine" (Prod.

On June 22, 2016, Riser released his third EP that year, titled ''R.I.S.E.'', which includes productions from [[808 Mafia]], [[Metro Boomin]], [[Sonny Digital]], [[TM88]] and [[Zaytoven]].<ref name="rise"/>

==Death==
Riser was one month away from releasing his second studio album, ''H.O.P.E.'', when he unexpectedly died in the early hours of June 12, 2021. His death was a shock across the Los Angeles music scene, and several of his fellow musicians paid tribute to him.<ref name=death/>

In 1991, Riley founded the [[political hip hop]] group [[The Coup]] with [[The Coup#E-roc|E-roc]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thorn |first1=Jesse |title=Boots Riley: The Coup, Sorry to Bother You, and more |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820433758/boots-riley-the-coup-sorry-to-bother-you-and-more |website=www.npr.org |access-date=18 January 2021 |date=24 March 2020}}</ref> Alongside rappers [[Spice 1]] and [[Mopreme Shakur]] (then known as Mocedes), they released a song on a 1991 compilation album called ''Dope Like a Pound or a Key'', released by Wax That Azz Records.<ref name=":2">"[https://www.allamericanspeakers.com/speakers/423418/Boots-Riley Boots Riley Biography]."

In 1992, The Coup signed to [[Wild Pitch Records]]/[[EMI]],<ref name=":2" /> and released their debut album ''[[Kill My Landlord]]'' in 1993. Two of the album's singles, "Dig It" and "Not Yet Free" received play on national Black radio, [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] and ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]''.<ref name=":2" />

In 1993, [[E-40]] released the video for "Practice Lookin' Hard", a song based around Riley's lyric, "I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard", from the song "Not Yet Free".<ref>{{Cite web|title=E-40's 'Practice Lookin' Hard' – Discover the Sample Source|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/89309/E-40-Practice-Lookin'-Hard-The-Coup-Not-Yet-Free/|access-date=January 11, 2017|website=WhoSampled}}</ref> The video featured Riley singing the chorus while he, E-40 and [[Tupac Shakur]] reflected light into the camera from a handheld mirror while dancing around.<ref>{{Citation|last=E40VEVO|title=E-40 – Practice Lookin' Hard|date=November 24, 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avkToQqG1qw |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211214/avkToQqG1qw |archive-date=2021-12-14 |url-status=live|access-date=January 11, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In 1994, The Coup released their second album, ''[[Genocide & Juice]]'', featuring guest appearances by E-40 and Spice 1. Fueled by video play and some radioplay for the single "Fat Cats and Bigga Fish", the album shot up the charts, but stalled when EMI absorbed Wild Pitch.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rabin |first1=Nathan |title=The Coup |url=https://www.avclub.com/the-coup-1798207982 |website=www.avclub.com |access-date=18 January 2021 |date=17 February 1999}}</ref> At this point, E-roc left The Coup on amicable terms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ducker |first1=Jesse |title=The Coup's 'Steal This Album' Turns 20 |url=https://www.albumism.com/features/the-coup-steal-this-album-turns-20-anniversary-retrospective |website=www.albumism.com |access-date=18 January 2021 |date=9 November 2018}}</ref>

1998's ''[[Steal This Album]]'', released on indie label Dogday Records, was called "a masterpiece of slow-rolling West Coast funk" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news|date=December 9, 1999|title=Coup de grace|page=51|work=The Rep|publisher=The Arizona Republic|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/124495728|url-access=subscription|access-date=January 11, 2017|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> The single, "Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada Last Night", was an eight-minute song about the grown-up son of a prostitute driving his mother's killer to a secluded place in which to murder him.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kogan |first1=Frank |title=Party to the People |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2001/11/06/party-to-the-people/ |website=www.villagevoice.com |access-date=19 January 2021 |date=6 November 2001}}</ref> A novel, ''Too Beautiful for Words'' by Monique W.

The group's fourth album, ''[[Party Music]]'', was released on 75 Ark Records in 2001. It was re-released in 2005 by [[Epitaph Records]]. The original cover art depicted group members standing in front of the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as they explode.<ref>{{cite web|title=Album cover of WTC blast pulled|url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/13/wtc.cover/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011113114947/http://www.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/13/wtc.cover/|archive-date=November 13, 2001|access-date=July 9, 2018|work=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Coup Cover Art|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coup-detat/|access-date=July 9, 2018|website=Snopes|date=20 September 2001 }}</ref> Riley is depicted pushing a button on a bass guitar tuner and DJ Pam the Funkstress is shown holding conductor's wands. The photo was taken in May 2001, with the album scheduled to be released just after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. In response to the uncanny similarity of the artwork with the attacks, the release was delayed until an alternative cover could be prepared. The album hit No. 8 in the 2001 ''[[Village Voice]]'' Pazz and Jop Poll- the most important year-end critics' list, was named "Pop Album of the Year" by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and "Hip-Hop Album of the Year" by ''Rolling Stone''. The album included a guest appearance by [[dead prez]] on the song "Get Up".

Riley released a controversial press release on September 18, 2001, later published in the book, ''Another World Is Possible''. The press release stated that "last week's events were symptomatic of a larger backlash against U.S. corporate imperialism". The controversy surrounding the cover art, press release and the lyrics from ''Party Music'' (specifically the song "5 Million Ways to Kill a CEO") led to Riley appearing on local network news affiliates all over the U.S. He appeared on [[Fox News]]'s ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' with [[Bill Maher]]. During this time, conservative commentator [[Michelle Malkin]] called Riley's lyrics "a stomach-turning example of anti-Americanism disguised as highbrow intellectual expression".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Malkin|first=Michelle|date=December 30, 2001|title=Stop giving America a bad rap|newspaper=Townhall|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/2001/12/30/stop_giving_america_a_bad_rap|url-status=live|access-date=January 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111212801/http://townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/2001/12/30/stop_giving_america_a_bad_rap|archive-date=January 11, 2017}}</ref> ''The Independent'' concluded it was "protest album of the year, by a million-man march".<ref>{{Cite news|date=November 9, 2001|title=Album: The Coup|newspaper=Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-the-coup-9210493.html|access-date=July 24, 2018}}</ref>

In 2006, The Coup released ''[[Pick a Bigger Weapon]]'' on Epitaph Records, featuring guest appearances by [[Tom Morello]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Black Thought]] from [[The Roots]], and [[Jello Biafra]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newlin |first1=Jimmy |title=Review: The Coup, Pick a Bigger Weapon |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/the-coup-pick-a-bigger-weapon/ |website=www.slantmagazine.com |access-date=20 January 2021 |date=23 April 2006}}</ref>

==== Work with Tom Morello ====
In 2003, guitarist [[Tom Morello]] invited Riley to be part of the "Tell Us the Truth Tour", which was meant to shed light on the [[monopolization]] of the media and the coming [[FTAA]] agreements.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Katz |first1=Larry |title=Can We Handle the Truth?

In 2006, Morello approached Riley to form a band together under the name Street Sweeper.

They toured in support of it along with [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Jane's Addiction]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kreps |first1=Daniel |title=Tom Morello's Street Sweeper Social Club Posts First Single |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tom-morellos-street-sweeper-social-club-posts-first-single-109365/ |website=www.rollingstone.com |access-date=18 January 2021 |date=28 April 2009}}</ref> On May 24, a press release went out announcing Street Sweeper Social Club as one of the headliners of the 2010 [[Rock the Bells]] tour.

In 1991, the same year Riley co-founded The Coup, he and other activists and hip hop artists created the Mau Mau Rhythm Collective.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cook|first=Dave|date=1996|title=Should rap artist run for political office?|url=http://www.daveyd.com/politicaloff.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111215430/http://www.daveyd.com/politicaloff.html|archive-date=January 11, 2017|access-date=January 11, 2017|website=daveyd.com}}</ref> The Collective put on "Hip-Hop [[Edutainment]] Concerts", which allied with and promoted the campaigns of community-based organizations like Women's Economic Agenda Project (WEAP), [[Copwatch]], International Campaign To Free [[Geronimo Pratt]], the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] Alumni Association, and various anti-police brutality projects.<ref>"[https://www.carleton.edu/news/stories/west-coast-hip-hop-artist-and-activist-to-appear-at-carleton-college/ West Coast Hip Hop Artist and Activist to Appear at Carleton College]."

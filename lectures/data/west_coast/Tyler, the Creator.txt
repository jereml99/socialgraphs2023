Okonma self-released his debut mixtape [[Bastard (Tyler, the Creator mixtape)|''Bastard'']] in 2009 and rapidly gained attention among the online music press for his [[horrorcore]]-influenced sound and violent, [[transgressive art|transgressive]] lyrical content. His debut studio album [[Goblin (album)|''Goblin'']] (2011) brought him mainstream exposure, which was aided by the popularity of the single "[[Yonkers (song)|Yonkers]]" and its accompanying music video. During this period, Odd Future gained rapid popularity and Okonma faced controversy over his lyrics. Beginning with his second album ''[[Wolf (Tyler, the Creator album)|Wolf]]'' (2013), Okonma began moving away from his stylistic horrorcore towards a more [[alternative hip hop]] sound. His 2015 album ''[[Cherry Bomb (album)|Cherry Bomb]]'' featured a greater focus on melodic and [[jazz]]-fused sounds which has continued throughout his later discography. Okonma's later albums, ''[[Flower Boy]]'' (2017), ''[[Igor (album)|Igor]]'' (2019) and ''[[Call Me If You Get Lost]]'' (2021), were all released to widespread critical acclaim, with the latter two debuting at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and each winning [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[2020 Grammy Awards|2020]] and [[2022 Grammy Awards]], respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-03 |title=Tyler, the Creator Wins Best Rap Album for Call Me If You Get Lost at the 2022 Grammys |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/tyler-the-creator-wins-best-rap-album-for-call-me-if-you-get-lost-at-the-2022-grammys/ |access-date=2022-04-06 |website=Pitchfork |language=en-US |archive-date=April 6, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220406203127/https://pitchfork.com/news/tyler-the-creator-wins-best-rap-album-for-call-me-if-you-get-lost-at-the-2022-grammys/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

"We had this conversation just wanting to snowboard when I was 12, but someone said 'That's white people sh**t. Black people don't do that.' No, you don't do that.

On March 15, 2014, Okonma was arrested in [[Austin, Texas]], for inciting a riot after telling fans to push their way past security guards at his [[South by Southwest]] performance.

On August 26, 2015, Okonma revealed that he had been banned from visiting the United Kingdom for three to five years, which forced him to cancel a string of tour dates supporting the ''Cherry Bomb'' album, including the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]]. The reason for the ban comes from lyrics dating back to 2009. His manager Christian Clancy said they were informed of the ban via a letter from then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]].<ref name="auto" /> May cited lyrics from the mixtape ''[[Bastard (Tyler, the Creator mixtape)|Bastard]]'' as the reason for the ban, although Okonma had toured multiple times in the UK since its release.<ref name="auto1" /><ref name="ITV News" /> Okonma later said that he felt he had been treated like a terrorist and implied that the ban was racially motivated, stating that "they did not like the fact that their children were idolizing a black man."<ref name="auto2" /> According to the BBC, it is believed the ban was lifted in February 2019,{{r|BBC Rowdy}} concurring with a scheduled performance in London to promote ''Igor''.

====Eminem====
On August 31, 2018, Eminem's single "[[Fall (Eminem song)|Fall]]" called Okonma a homophobic slur and claimed Okonma explored sexuality in his music for more attention.<ref>{{Cite web |last=ago |first=Music-4 years |date=2018-09-14 |title=Eminem Reveals Tyler, The Creator Diss Was Because Tyler And Earl Sweatshirt Criticized His Music |url=https://www.okayplayer.com/music/why-did-eminem-diss-tyler-the-creator-on-fall.html |access-date=2022-04-07 |website=Okayplayer |language=en-US |archive-date=November 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111211851/https://www.okayplayer.com/music/why-did-eminem-diss-tyler-the-creator-on-fall.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Eminem also attacked Okonma for being critical of his single "[[Walk on Water (Eminem song)|Walk On Water]]" and ''[[Shady XV]]'' (2014).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-11-14 |title=Tyler The Creator Disses Eminem Says "Walk On Water" Is Trash |url=https://urbanislandz.com/2017/11/14/tyler-the-creator-disses-eminem-says-walk-on-water-is-trash/ |access-date=2022-04-07 |website=Urban Islandz |language=en-US |archive-date=January 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117230613/https://urbanislandz.com/2017/11/14/tyler-the-creator-disses-eminem-says-walk-on-water-is-trash/ |url-status=live }}</ref> After receiving backlash for his lyrics,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-08-31 |title=Eminem Slammed for Homophobic Diss About Tyler, The Creator on His New Album |url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-slammed-for-homophobic-diss-about-tyler-the-creator/ |access-date=2022-04-07 |website=Us Weekly |language=en-US |archive-date=April 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407205504/https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-slammed-for-homophobic-diss-about-tyler-the-creator/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Eminem responded in an interview with [[Sway Calloway|Sway]], saying, "I think the word that I called him was one of the things where I felt like this might be too far. In my quest to hurt him, I realized I was hurting a lot of other people. It was one of the things that I kept going back to. Not feeling right with this". In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Okonma responded, saying, "[The "Fall" line] was okay. Did you ever hear me publicly say anything about that? I knew what the intent was. He felt pressured because people got offended for me. We were playing ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' when we heard it. We rewound it and [shrugged]. Then kept playing".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-10-05 |title=Tyler, the Creator: 'Theresa May's gone, so I'm back in the UK' |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/05/tyler-the-creator-back-after-uk-ban-funk-reinvention-homophobia-accusations |access-date=2022-04-07 |website=The Guardian |language=en |archive-date=April 10, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410051852/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/05/tyler-the-creator-back-after-uk-ban-funk-reinvention-homophobia-accusations |url-status=live }}</ref>

====DJ Khaled====
In June 2019, after ''Igor'' debuted at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200 over [[DJ Khaled]]'s album ''[[Father of Asahd]]'', DJ Khaled posted a video on Instagram, criticizing Okonma's music saying, "I make albums so people can play it and you actually hear it. [If] driving your car, you hear another car playing it, go to the barbershop, you hear them playing it [and] turn the radio on, and you hear them playing it. It's called great music. It's called albums [where] you actually hear the songs. Not mysterious shit you never hear".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-06-08 |title=DJ Khaled Appears To Shade Tyler, The Creator For Beating Him To #1 |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2047049/dj-khaled-tyler-the-creator-number-one-shade/news/ |access-date=2022-04-07 |website=Stereogum |language=en |archive-date=October 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211021005440/https://www.stereogum.com/2047049/dj-khaled-tyler-the-creator-number-one-shade/news/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He then deleted the video.

On August 6, 2021, Okonma spoke about the DJ Khaled controversy on [[HOT 97|Hot 97]], stating that he enjoyed "just watching a man die inside because the weirdo is winning". He claimed that DJ Khaled "had to deal with that because his whole identity is being number one and when he didn't get that, that sat with him longer in real life time than that moment. I moved on."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-08-09 |title=Tyler, The Creator says he watched DJ Khaled "die inside" after chart battle loss |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/tyler-the-creator-watched-dj-khaled-die-inside-3014734 |access-date=2022-04-07 |website=NME |language=en-GB |archive-date=April 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407205504/https://www.nme.com/news/music/tyler-the-creator-watched-dj-khaled-die-inside-3014734 |url-status=live }}</ref> Okonma made multiple references to "mysterious music" on Twitter, writing "MYSTERIOUS MUSIC!

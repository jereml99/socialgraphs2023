'''Stanley Petey Cox''' (born January 23, 1982), better known by his stage name '''Mistah F.A.B.''' (backronym for '''Money Is Something To Always Have–Forever After Bread'''), is an American [[rapper]], songwriter, entrepreneur, [[community organizer]] and activist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/22/PKGBKLPD8C1.DTL&type=music/ | title= Mistah F.A.B. | work=Sfgate.com | date=October 22, 2006}}</ref>

F.A.B.'s music career began in the late 1990s when he was discovered by Jazzy Jim and Gary Archer.  He was featured on a number of [[Mac Dre]]'s Thizz Nation mixtape compilations and quickly gained prominence in the San Francisco Bay Area [[hyphy]] movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/my_block/oakland/news_feature_030506/ | title= My Bock The Bay| work=MTVNews.com | date=March 5, 2006}}</ref> With burgeoning national interest in Bay Area hip-hop around 2005, his single in December "Yellow Bus" shortly followed by the album ''Yellow Bus'' in January 2006, F.A.B. became the subject of a major-label bidding war, signing with [[Atlantic Records]] that September, under subsidiary, [[Thizz Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/hiphop/ci_5869850?nclick_check=1/ | title=What happened to hyphy?| work=Mercurynews.com | date=May 13, 2007}}</ref> Howbeit F.A.B., who had deep independent ties with the music business in North Oakland, decided to forgo his major label deal and ventured out to launch his own imprint Faeva Afta Music in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.17865/title.mistah-fab-explains-maintaining-integrity-and-relationships-on-i-found-my-backpack-2| title=Mistah F.A.B.

F.A.B. is known as one of the most prominent and colorful figures of the hyphy scene since the late 2000s, and is sometimes hailed as the scene's "Crown Prince".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reclaimthemedia.org/arts_activism/kmel_and_the_demise_of_hyphy%3D5813| title=KMEL and the demise of hyphy| work=Reclaimthemedia.org | date=February 22, 2008}}</ref> He quickly become a central figure of the hyphy movement, a musical and cultural offshoot of hip-hop from the Bay Area that carries a bass-heavy beat, blaring synthesizers and an emphasis on having fun. When F.A.B. boasted of doing "the dummy retarded" in "Super Sic Wit It," he was describing an emerging aesthetic and philosophical ideal evolving within the Rap culture at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2007/02/go_dumb.html/ | title=Go Dumb| work=Slate.com | date=February 2007}}</ref>

F.A.B. garnered worldwide recognition on other fronts as well particularly as a battle rapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/the-25-greatest-rap-battles-on-youtube/mistah-fab-jin-tha-emcee/ | title=The 25 Greatest Rap Battles On Youtube| work=Complex.com | date=February 2013}}</ref> F.A.B. defeated many MCs in the niche genre, including [[Clyde Carson]] of [[The Team (band)|The Team]], [[Jin (rapper)|Jin]] of [[Ruff Ryders]] and [[Royce Da 5'9]] of [[Slaughterhouse (hip hop group)|Slaughterhouse]].

==1982–2000: Early life and career beginnings==
Stanley P. Cox was born on January 23, 1982, in Oakland, California, the son of Stanley Cox Sr. and Desrie A. Jeffery. He was raised by his mother and grandparents.  F.A.B.'s father was incarcerated for much of his childhood. His father died of AIDS-related complications when F.A.B. was twelve years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=85281900181 | title=Mistah F.A.B. – Da Baydestrian | work=newburycomics | date=March 15, 2007}}</ref> He is the cousin of [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Marshawn Lynch]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://andscape.com/features/marshawn-lynch-oakland-beast-mode/|title=36 Hours in Beast Mode|first=Lonnae|last=O'Neal|website=[[Andscape]]|date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>

He attended [[Oakland Technical High School]] and transferred to Emery High School where he later graduated. As a teenager, F.A.B. was an avid basketball player and point guard of his high school team. F.A.B. was forced to quit basketball after he sustained an injury on the court.

Soon after, he began to enter local freestyle rap competitions and earn a reputation as a formidable rapper and freestyler.

==Musical career==
Mistah F.A.B., began his musical rise in Oakland, CA, as a young artist signed to Straight Hits Entertainment, where he dropped his debut album, ''[[Nig-Latin]]'' in 2003. Although this album garnered some success and recognition, F.A.B.'s recognition came from his skills as a battle rapper.  F.A.B. won battles against the likes of [[Clyde Carson]] from [[The Team (band)|The Team]] and [[Royce Da 5'9]]. His popularity lead to F.A.B. getting signed to [[Mac Dre]]'s [[Thizz Entertainment]] in 2004. Under Thizz ENT, F.A.B. blossomed as a front runner in the [[Bay Area]]'s [[hyphy]] movement. With songs like "Super Sic Wit It," "N.E.W. Oakland," and "Kicked Out The Club," F.A.B.'s ''[[Son of a Pimp]]'' album was an instant success around the Bay Area, with featured collaborations Dre, E-40, Turf Talk, and G-Stack of Oakland heroes the Delinquents—as well as Kanye West.

However, a series of obstacles staggered F.A.B.'s career momentum. KMEL-FM, the Bay's top urban station, imposed an unofficial but crippling blacklist of F.A.B.'s songs and guest appearances, due to petty personal grievances as well as the perceived slight of his successful show on a rival station, thereby significantly undermining his hometown visibility. Later, his breakout single, "Ghost Ride It," was the subject of controversy on two fronts – a national clamor over the hyphy practice of "[[ghost riding]]" described in the song (throwing a car in neutral, then jumping out and walking alongside or riding on the roof as it continues to move)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/26/AR2006122600994.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006204129/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/26/AR2006122600994.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 6, 2008 | title=Ghost-Riding: Brake-Dancing With Zip Under the Hood| work=Washingtonpost.com | date=December 12, 2006}}</ref> and Columbia Pictures' threatened legal action over the use of the Ghostbusters logo in the video (the track samples the movie's theme song). This caused the video to be first heavily censored and then pulled from television altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/music/ci_5894566 | title=Mistah F.A.B. walks the walk| work=Mercurynews.com | date=May 14, 2007}}</ref>

Da Yellow Bus Rydah, F.A.B.'s debut studio album for Atlantic, originally scheduled for spring of 2007, was delayed by over two years (and most recently slated for a 2009 release under the revised title The Bus Ride). However, thanks to an unusually liberal contract, he was able to keep busy with work on independent labels, instead releasing a Thizz full-length album, Da Baydestrian, in May 2007, and continuing his steady stream of mixtapes and album-length collaborations with G-Stack, Turf Talk, the Alchemist, and Glasses Malone through 2015 (including Hyphy Ain't Dead, a collaboration with Turf Talk).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mistah-fab-mn0000771300/biography | title=Mistah F.A.B.

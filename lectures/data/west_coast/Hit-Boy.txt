In 2016, Hit-Boy and Local Los Angeles rapper [[Dom Kennedy]] came together to work on a joint mixtape named ''Half-A-Mil'' EP, subsequently adopting the name (dropping the EP) as an alias for the duo. ''Half-A-Mil'' EP was released on December 11, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stream Dom Kennedy And Hit-Boy's Joint EP, Half-A-Mil|url=https://www.thefader.com/2016/12/11/dom-kennedy-hit-boy-half-a-mil-ep|access-date=April 12, 2021|website=The FADER|date=December 11, 2016 |language=en|archive-date=April 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412023920/https://www.thefader.com/2016/12/11/dom-kennedy-hit-boy-half-a-mil-ep|url-status=live}}</ref> The mixtape consisted of five songs, with "100 Rounds" being the lead single off the mixtape. Following the release of their first mixtape, the pair decided to put out another mixtape a few months after their previous mixtape. ''Half-A-Mil 2'' EP released on February 24, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Half-A-Mil 2 EP Mixtape by Dom Kennedy x Hit-Boy|url=https://www.datpiff.com/Dom-Kennedy-x-Hit-Boy-Half-A-Mil-2-EP-mixtape.831065.html|access-date=April 12, 2021|website=www.datpiff.com|archive-date=April 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412023923/https://www.datpiff.com/Dom-Kennedy-x-Hit-Boy-Half-A-Mil-2-EP-mixtape.831065.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The mixtape contained six songs with one guest feature from B.Carr. The duo would take a break and would not release music under the [[Half-A-Mil]] name. After some time, the frequent collaborators released ''Half-A-Mil 3'' EP, continuing the mixtape series and being the last one in the saga. ''Half-A-Mil'' 3 EP was August 8, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 7, 2017|title=Dom Kennedy & Hit-Boy Join Forces For "Half-A-Mil 3" EP|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.44299/title.dom-kennedy-hit-boy-join-forces-for-half-a-mil-3-ep|access-date=April 12, 2021|website=HipHopDX|archive-date=April 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412023922/https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.44299/title.dom-kennedy-hit-boy-join-forces-for-half-a-mil-3-ep|url-status=live}}</ref> The mixtape only had two feature from [[24hrs (rapper)|24hrs]] on "Don't run" and [[Quentin Miller]] on the tracks "Might as Well" and "In The Hills".

The Tandem would go on to take a hiatus and not release any new music. Nearly two and half years later, the group would release their second studio. "Also Known As" was released on July 31, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 5, 2020|title=Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy Return As Half-A-Mil For "Also Known As" » Hype Off Life|url=https://hypeofflife.com/hit-boy-dom-kennedy-also-known-as/|access-date=April 12, 2021|website=Hype Off Life|language=en-US|archive-date=April 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412023926/https://hypeofflife.com/hit-boy-dom-kennedy-also-known-as/|url-status=live}}</ref> The album consists of 11 tracks and features from [[03 Greedo]], [[24hrs (rapper)|24hrs]], and [[Nas]].

From 2020 to 2022, Hit-Boy teamed up with [[Nas]] to executively produce the King's Disease series, [[King's Disease]], [[King's Disease II]], and most recently [[King's Disease III]] to close out 2022. King's Disease 1 and 2 were consecutively nominated for Grammy Award for Best Rap Album of the Year, with [[King's Disease]] winning and awarding Nas with the rapper's first Grammy award throughout his storied career. They also collaborated on Nas's fifteenth studio album, [[Magic (Nas album)|Magic]] in late 2022.

In 2023, Hit-Boy has worked on and released a multitude of projects- including kicking off a series of his own albums titled ''SURF OR DROWN'' in March, featuring appearances from [[Nas]], [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], [[Currensy|Curren$y]] & more. Not even three months later, Hit-Boy followed up the album with its sequel, ''SURF OR DROWN Vol. 2'', on Father's Day in June alongside his father, Big Hit, who appears on nine of the ten songs. In May, Big Hit was released from prison after serving nine years and got right back to the studio to pick up where he left off. Before his incarceration in 2014, Big Hit had grown a fanbase following the release of the hit songs, ''Grindin' My Whole Life'' and ''G'z Don't Cry'', both produced by Hit-Boy. ''SURF OR DROWN Vol. 2'' is a celebration of the reunification of the father son rap duo, and the continuation of Big Hit's career in the music industry.

Hit-Boy executive produced a handful of albums and songs for different artists in 2023, including executive producing three Nas albums ([[King's Disease III]], [[Magic 2]], and [[Magic 3]]), [[Musiq Soulchild]]'s ''Victims & Villains'', Madden 2024 Soundtrack (for the second year in a row), a single for Creed III Soundtrack with [[Blxst]], collaborating again for ''Bus Stop'' and ''Go Down''  with Don Toliver on his album ''[[Love Sick (album)|Love Sick]]'', "[[Delresto (Echoes)]]" by [[Travis Scott]] and [[Beyoncé]] from Scott's ''[[Utopia (Travis Scott album)|Utopia]]'' (producing on Travis' last three albums), confirmed to be executive producing alongside The Alchemist on [[Benny the Butcher]]'s new album ''Everybody Can't Go'', and more.

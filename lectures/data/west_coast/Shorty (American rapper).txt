'''Jerome Muhammad''' (September 14, 1967 – June 19, 2019), born '''Jerome Washington''', better known by his stage name '''Shorty''', was an American [[rapper]], producer, gang intervention [[Activism|activist]], and member of [[Ice Cube|Ice Cube's]] spin-off Platinum [[hip hop group]] [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jerome Muhammad|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0969774/|access-date=2020-09-24|website=IMDb}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, Shorty's mother Mabel Washington moved him and his older brother Jeff to Los Angeles CA in 1968.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Celebrating the life of Jerome 'Brother Shorty' Muhammad|url=https://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/National_News_2/Celebrating-the-life-of-Jerome-Brother-Shorty-Muhammad.shtml|access-date=2020-12-17|website=www.finalcall.com}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Jerome competed locally as a [[The Lockers|pop lock]] dancer with other friends in his neighborhood. The dance team put aside dancing in order to protect their neighborhood from rival groups and formed “Marvin Avenue Gangster Crips” in Los Angeles, CA of which Shorty an adolescent was a founding member of the street organization. The organization is named after Marvin Avenue, a street located West of Hauser Blvd, between Venice and Washington Blvd.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-05-01|title=Marvin Gangster Crips|url=https://unitedgangs.com/marvin-gangster-crips/|access-date=2020-09-24|language=en-US}}</ref>

== The Lench Mob (Posse) ==
After being convicted and serving three years in [[California State Prison, Corcoran|Corcoran state]] prison for robbing a Los Angeles police officer, Shorty was released on parole and returned to his neighborhood of West Los Angeles.

The highly publicized acrimonious departure of [[Ice Cube]] from the group [[N.W.A]]. required him to recruit protection from threats from his former label. During this time Shorty's childhood friend and future bandmate, [[J-Dee]] (Dasean Cooper,) introduced Shorty to Ice Cube. Shorty's street reputation preceded him and Ice Cube hired Shorty the first day they met as a personal bodyguard and part of his existing growing entourage or posse called “The Lench Mob.” At this time ''The Lench Mob'' was not a recording group but included members such as Female Rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]], Producer Dj [[Chilly Chill]], Producer [[Sir Jinx]], Rapper T-Bone, [[Del the Funky Homosapien]], [[K-Dee]], [[Maulkie]] and others.

In September 1990, Shorty and The Lench Mob posse clashed with Eazy E's hip hop act [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]] during the annual [[New Music Seminar]] conference at the [[Times Square]]'s [[New York Marriott Marquis|Marriott Marquis]] hotel.  The parties agreed to fight in a bathroom, away from cameras but instead squared off in front of the convention crowd. Shorty threw the first punch at [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]]'s Total K-Oss, and J-Dee took on KMG the Illustrator. Actor LaDell Preston plays Jerome “Shorty” Muhammad in the critically acclaimed 2015 film “[[Straight Outta Compton (film)|Straight outta Compton]],” directed by [[F. Gary Gray]] where this altercation was dramatized.<ref>{{Cite web|last=dkelsen|title=The Truth Behind Ice Cube's Legendary Brawl With Above the Law – OC Weekly|url=https://www.ocweekly.com/the-truth-behind-ice-cubes-legendary-brawl-with-above-the-law-7490822/|access-date=2020-09-24|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Da Lench Mob (music recording group) ==
While on tour, members of rap group Public Enemy namely Professor Griff exposed Ice Cube, Shorty and The Lench Mob to Black history and social consciousness. In several interviews Shorty attributes his transformation from a life of crime to gang intervention by the teachings of The Honorable [[Elijah Muhammad]] while on tour with [[Public Enemy]]. In 1991 Shorty joined the Nation of Islam in Los Angeles and changed his last name from Washington to Muhammad and married the same year.

In 1992 Shorty collaborated creatively with longtime friend J-Dee, T-Bone, and Ice Cube to form a recording group bearing the name "Da Lench Mob."  The debut album entitled “[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]” was certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] on December 18, 1992, indicating US sales of over 1,000,000 units.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Jerome Shorty Muhammad Obituary|url=https://app.box.com/s/5rj7cl3w7f7fb0nlabtuhycj612ac934|access-date=2020-09-24|website=app.box.com}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
A documentary film entitled “Comin’ up Short” produced by [[Ice Cube]], Steve Muhammad-EL and directed by [[Queen Muhammad Ali]] and [[Hakeem Khaaliq]] details Shorty's life in and out of the music industry.[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-02-16/sundance-muslims-documentary-film-middle-east#:~:text=from%20%E2%80%9CComin%E2%80%99%20up%20Short%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20feature%2Dlength%20documentary%20set%20in%20South%20L.A.%20that%20follows%20Shorty%20(Jerome%20Muhammad)%2C%20a%20member%20of%20Ice%20Cube%E2%80%99s%20platinum%20recording%20group%20Da%20Lench%20Mob] The film received a grant from ISF Scholarship fund and will be released posthumously.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Media |first=Bionic |title=COMIN' UP SHORT - Abacus |url=https://www.abacusmediarights.com/programme/3524/comin-up-short |access-date=2022-05-25 |website=Abacus Media Rights |language=en}}</ref> [https://queenmuhammadali.com/comin-up-short/]

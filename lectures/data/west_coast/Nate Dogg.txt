He gained recognition for providing guest vocals for a multitude of hit rap songs between 1992 and 2007, earning the nickname "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Hooks]]".<ref name=":0">Garth Cartwright, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/16/nate-dogg-obituary "Nate Dogg obituary"], ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK), March 16, 2011.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/nate-doggs-elaborate-new-headstone-honors-the-late-king-of-hooks-9326820/|title=Nate Dogg's Elaborate New Headstone Honors the Late 'King of Hooks'|first=Heran|last=Mamo|website=Billboard.com|date=March 2, 2020|access-date=December 29, 2021}}</ref>

Hale began his career in the early 1990s as a member of [[213 (group)|213]], a trio he formed in 1990 with his cousin [[Snoop Dogg]] and friend [[Warren G]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1994, he was featured on the latter's hit single "[[Regulate (song)|Regulate]]", which reached number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and served as a breakout success for both artists.<ref name=":1">John Bush, [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nate-dogg-mn0000373592/biography "Nate Dogg: Biography"], ''[[AllMusic.com]]'', Netaktion LLC, visited April 24, 2020.</ref><ref>[[Joel Whitburn]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EW9RsB0a0oAC&pg=PA9 The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits]'', 9th edn.

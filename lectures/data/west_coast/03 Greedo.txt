== Early life ==
Jason Jamal Jackson was born in [[West Los Angeles, California]], on July 26, 1987, to Michael and Lisa Jackson. In late 1988, when Jackson was only a year old, his father was killed in a motorcycle accident. This was shortly after his parents had purchased their home in [[Gardena, California]], where Jackson was raised along with his brother and sister. He was the youngest of the three. Prior to his father's death, he and his family lived in Los Angeles near the Chester Washington Golf Course. As a toddler, he had a series of ear infections which resulted in a [[tympanostomy tube]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/03/06/03-greedo-first-night-out-purple-summer-la-interview|title=How 03 Greedo became a living legend|work=The Fader|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}</ref> At age 17, Jackson was expecting a baby with his high school girlfriend. He worked various retail jobs and sold his own beats in anticipation of supporting his only child – a daughter who was born after they turned 18<ref name=":0" /> – and her mother. Soon after, he began to sell drugs to support his family. Jackson was kicked out of his home by his mother after she grew tired of his disrespectful behavior. He stayed with various friends, including his daughter's mother; he also spent a period of time homeless.<ref name=":0" /> He  moved to the Watts area of Los Angeles and later settled in [[Jordan Downs|the Jordan Downs Housing Projects]] in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]].<ref name=":0" />

== Career ==
Jackson initially used the alias Greedy Giddy, under which he self-produced six mixtapes including the ''Bipolar'' series, ''Everybody Weak'', and ''Money, Powder, Regrets''.<ref name=":0" /> His early career was heavily influenced by [[Southern hip hop|Southern rap]] with auto-tuned harmonics and melodic trap instrumentals. This early work is fragmented with a handful of recordings on DatPiff, YouTube, and Tumblr.<ref name=":0" />

As Greedy Giddy, Jackson released numerous tracks to SoundCloud between 2014 and 2016. In 2016, Jackson changed his name to 03 Greedo and self-produced two mixtapes, ''Purple Summer'' and ''Purple Summer 2: Sun Don’t Shine''. He also started his own label, Golden Grenade Empire, in 2016. In 2017 Jackson produced three mixtapes, ''Purple Summer 03: Purple Hearted Soldier'', ''First Night Out'', and ''Money Changes Everything''.<ref name=":1" />

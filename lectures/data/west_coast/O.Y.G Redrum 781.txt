==History==
Carter was born in [[Bronx, New York]]. He resided with his mother and young brother there until the age of 5, when he relocated to [[Inglewood, California]] with his family. Unfamiliar with their new surroundings and because of the infestation of drug dealers and addicts, pimps and prostitutes, hustlers, and gang-bangers, his mother feared when he and his young sibling would try to venture outside. Eventually his younger brother was initiated into the Avenue Piru Blood Gang<ref>[http://www.streetgangs.com/bloods/inglewood/apg Avenue Piru Gang (APG)] StreetGangs.com May 17, 2014 Retrieved. May 17, 2014</ref> (APG's, in Inglewood, CA); being fearful for his little brother's safety RedRum soon found himself being initiated into the same gang to protect his younger brother.

He actively started rapping when he attended [[Morningside High School]], winning several talent shows and contests.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Career==

===Bloods and Crips===
In 1993, ''"[[Bangin' on Wax]]"'' was a gangster music developed project by both the Bloods and the Crips.

Actual gang members from both sides auditioned on a tryout and the best ones were chosen for the project. The album was released in 1993 on Warlock Records and was a success selling over at many copies. There is also another album from the Bloods and the Crips on the Bangin' project titled ''"[[Bangin' on Wax 2... The Saga Continues]]"'', which was released in 1994. After this CD, however, the rappers who appeared on the albums began recording separate albums for Warlock Records, under the group names [[Nationwide Rip Ridaz]] (Crips) and [[Damu Ridas]] I and II (Bloods). Unfortunately for some of the members of Bangin On Wax were incarcerated or have been killed in gang actions.

'''Tracy Lynn Curry''' (born June 10, 1968), better known as '''The D.O.C.''', is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. In addition to a solo career, he was a member of the [[Southern hip hop]] group [[Fila Fresh Crew]] and later collaborated with [[hardcore rap]] group [[N.W.A]]–where he co-wrote many of their releases–as well as [[Eazy-E]]'s solo debut album ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]''. He has also worked with [[Dr. Dre]], co-writing his [[The Chronic|solo debut album]], while Dre produced Curry's [[No One Can Do It Better|solo debut album]], released by [[Ruthless Records]]. He was one of the founders of [[Death Row Records]] along with [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Suge Knight]].

After Fila Fresh Crew split up in 1988, the D.O.C. went on to pursue a successful solo career. In 1989, he released his debut album, ''[[No One Can Do It Better]]'', which reached number-one on the US [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart for two weeks and spawned two number one hits on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart: "[[It's Funky Enough]]" and "[[The D.O.C. & The Doctor]]". The album went platinum five years after its release. In late 1989, months after the release of ''No One Can Do It Better'', the D.O.C. suffered a serious car crash that permanently changed his voice. Since his accident, he has released two more albums, ''[[Helter Skelter (The D.O.C. album)|Helter Skelter]]'' in 1996 and ''[[Deuce (The D.O.C. album)|Deuce]]'' in 2003. In 2015, he said his voice was fully recovered.

== Early life and education ==

Tracy Lynn Curry was born on June 10, 1968, in Dallas, Texas. As a teenager, Curry began his career as a member of [[Fila Fresh Crew]], a hip hop trio that originated in Dallas, Texas. While in the group, Curry was known as '''Doc-T.'''

== Career ==
=== Fila Fresh Crew ===
In 1987, Fila Fresh Crew had four songs featured on the compilation album ''[[N.W.A and the Posse]]'' which featured various other artists; the same four tracks would later appear on the group's album ''[[Tuffest Man Alive]]'', which was released in 1988. Though the album would produce three singles, the group disbanded not long after its release. By this point, Curry had moved to [[Los Angeles]] and become acquainted with members of ''N.W.A'' and [[Ruthless Records]].

=== Ruthless Records and ''No One Can Do It Better'' ===
Curry would begin using the name the D.O.C. after he was signed to [[Eazy-E]]'s [[Ruthless Records]]. The D.O.C. contributed lyrics to [[N.W.A]]'s debut studio album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'',<ref name="whoz">{{cite book |last=Stancell  |first=Steven  |date=1996 |title=Rap Whoz Who: The World of Rap Music, Performers, Producers & Promoters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UWyfAAAAMAAJ |location=New York |publisher=Schrimer Books |page=81 |isbn=0-02-864520-0 }}</ref> and performed the opening verse on "Parental Discretion Iz Advised". Curry also wrote for Eazy-E's debut studio album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'' and co-wrote "Keep Watchin'" from [[Michel'le]]'s [[Michel'le (album)|self-titled debut album]].

In 1989, the D.O.C. released his solo debut, the [[Dr. Dre]]-produced ''[[No One Can Do It Better]]''. The album was very well received by critics, and sold well, peaking at no. 20 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for two consecutive weeks; by 1994, the album reached Platinum status.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Steve Huey|title=The D.O.C.: No One Can Do It Better|website=[[AllMusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/no-one-can-do-it-better-mw0000200341|access-date=August 19, 2015}}</ref> [[Allmusic]] gives the album a five-star rating and describes it as "an early landmark of West Coast Rap" as well as "an undeniable masterpiece". ''No One Can Do It Better'' produced five singles and five music videos.

=== Automobile crash and move to Death Row ===
In November 1989, five months after the release of ''No One Can Do It Better'', Curry was involved in a near-fatal car crash. Driving home from a party, he [[sleep-deprived driving|fell asleep at the wheel]] and his car veered off the freeway. Curry, who was not wearing a [[seat belt]], was thrown out the rear window, slamming face-first into a tree. His injuries required 21 hours of plastic surgery, and he spent 2½ weeks in the hospital. He could not speak for about a month, and he was left with a different, raspier voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-21/entertainment/ca-59615_1_helter-skelter|title=The D.O.C.

Details Damaging His Voice in Car Accident | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

The D.O.C. continued to write for N.W.A and contributed lyrics and minor vocals to their 1990 EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', where he co-wrote all the songs except for "Just Don't Bite It" and "Kamurshol", and their final album ''[[Niggaz4Life]]''.

In 1991, the D.O.C. left Ruthless Records along with Dr. Dre and Michel'le to sign with newly founded [[Death Row Records]]. The D.O.C. also used his talents as one of the writers for Dr. Dre's debut solo album ''[[The Chronic]]'', contributing to the tracks "[[Nuthin' but a G Thang]]", "Lil' Ghetto Boy", "A Nigga Witta Gun", "Lyrical Gangbang" and "[[Bitches Ain't Shit]]".  He also appeared on the skit track "The $20 Sack Pyramid".  He is referenced by name in "[[Nuthin' but a G Thang]]", and appears in the song's video as well.  The liner notes to ''[[The Chronic]]'' say, "I want to give a special shout out to The D.O.C. for talking me into doin' this album."  His name is mentioned by [[Snoop Dogg]] in the [[The Chronic Intro|intro]] of the album. ("Peace to da D.O.C., still makin' it funky enough").

In addition to ''The Chronic'', the D.O.C. worked on Snoop Dogg's debut album ''[[Doggystyle]]'', and added some vocals on the song "Serial Killa". The D.O.C. continued to be a [[ghostwriter]] for various songs on Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg albums. "[[Real Muthaphuckkin G's]]", from [[Eazy-E]]'s 1993 extended play ''[[It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa]]'', includes lyrics sampled from "[[It's Funky Enough]]" in the song's hook.

=== Feud with Dr. Dre and ''Helter Skelter'' ===
In 1996, the D.O.C. attempted a comeback following the car crash which severely damaged his vocal cords. The album, titled ''[[Helter Skelter (The D.O.C. album)|Helter Skelter]]'', produced two singles with music videos. ''Helter Skelter'' was widely ignored and even somewhat discredited by the D.O.C. himself.<ref name="ruthless_to_death_row">{{cite interview|first=Tracy|last=Curry|subject-link=The D.O.C.|title=From Ruthless To Death Row|url=http://www.thaformula.com/d_o_c__-_ruthless_to_deathrow.htm|date=March 19, 2002|interviewer=ThaFormula.Com|access-date=September 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205213233/http://www.thaformula.com/d_o_c__-_ruthless_to_deathrow.htm|archive-date=February 5, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The name of the album is a reference to [[Charles Manson]]'s idea of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]" prophesying the end of the world.

The title and concept behind this album were originally developed by Dr. Dre as a collaborative effort between him and [[Ice Cube]], titled ''Heltah Skeltah''. At that time, however, the D.O.C. had become disillusioned with [[Death Row Records]] and Dre, having received no payment for his work [[ghostwriter|ghostwriting]] at Death Row.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} So in late 1994, D.O.C. decided to leave Death Row and headed to [[Atlanta]]. Taking lyrics he had already written for ''Heltah Skeltah'', he recorded ''Helter Skelter'', keeping the name to spite Dre.<ref name="ruthless_to_death_row" /> His lyrics were inspired by the writings of [[Milton William Cooper]]. Especially noticeable in songs ''Secret Plan'' and ''Welcome to the New World''.

=== Silverback Records and ''Deuce'' ===
In 1997, the D.O.C. founded his own Dallas-based record label, '''Silverback Records'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.silverbackrecords.com/mission.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021207223433/http://www.silverbackrecords.com/mission.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 7, 2002|title=Silverback Records|date=December 7, 2002}}</ref> The D.O.C. introduced Dallas rapper 6Two to Dre, who featured him on his 1999 comeback album ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]''; Curry also provided lyrics for the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.silverbackrecords.com/bio.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020206063208/http://www.silverbackrecords.com/bio.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 6, 2002|title=Bio|date=February 6, 2002}}</ref> On July 20, 2000, the D.O.C. appeared on stage with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg at [[The Centrum]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] during the [[Up in Smoke Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geniusrap.com/hip-hop-dvds/the-up-in-smoke-tour.html |title=Archived copy |website=geniusrap.com |access-date=January 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107044713/http://geniusrap.com/hip-hop-dvds/the-up-in-smoke-tour.html |archive-date=January 7, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2003, the D.O.C. released his third album entitled ''[[Deuce (The D.O.C. album)|Deuce]]'' on Silverback Records. The album was originally meant to be a 6Two album, completely produced by Dr. Dre and released through [[Aftermath Entertainment]]. However, D.O.C. and Dre argued over whether D.O.C. should be rapping on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/thedoc08-part1 |title=// The D.O.C. Interview (Part 1) (April 2008) // West Coast News Network // |publisher=Dubcnn.com |access-date=September 29, 2015}}</ref> The D.O.C.'s presence on this album is minimal however, making an appearance to introduce tracks or perform in skits such as "My Prayer" and "Souliloquy". The only single released from ''Deuce'' was "[[Deuce (The D.O.C. album)#Singles|The Shit]]", which features former-[[N.W.A]] members [[MC Ren]] and [[Ice Cube]], along with Snoop Dogg and 6Two. ''Deuce'' focuses primarily on showcasing other artists on D.O.C.'s Silverback Records label, including U.P.-T.I.G.H.T., El Dorado, and in particular, 6Two.

=== Later career ===
The D.O.C. wrote lyrics for Snoop Dogg's album ''[[Tha Blue Carpet Treatment]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/thedoc/|title=dubcnn.com // The D.O.C. Interview (December 2006) // West Coast News Network //|website=Dubcnn.com|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref> In December 2006, the D.O.C. revealed that he was working on his fourth album, entitled ''Voices'', and stated that it would be released after Dr. Dre's upcoming fourth album ''[[Detox (Dr. Dre album)|Detox]]'', which was scrapped in favor of 2015's ''[[Compton (Dr. Dre album)|Compton]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/thedoc/|title=dubcnn.com // The D.O.C.

Dre and I decided to do another D.O.C. album after this ''Detox'' record. We decided to do one more together and end our story the right way."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/thedoc08-part1/|title=dubcnn.com // The D.O.C.

Although he is not mentioned in the songwriting credits, the D.O.C. claimed that he helped write Dr. Dre's third album ''[[Compton (album)|Compton]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The DOC speaks of getting his voice back|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/the-doc-voice-back-interview|website=Vice|date=October 15, 2015 |access-date=May 26, 2016}}</ref>

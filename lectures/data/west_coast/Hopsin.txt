=== Orlando arrest ===
[[File:Hopsin mugshot 2012-8-26.jpg|thumb|140px|Photo by the [[Orlando Police Department]], August 26, 2012.]]
On August 25, 2012, Hopsin was scheduled to perform at Club 57 West, a popular night club located in [[Orlando, Florida]]. At the last minute, the club promoters chose to pull the last opening act, causing a verbal altercation between the club promoters and the artist's entourage. Some witnesses claim Hopsin tried to settle the argument verbally, while Hopsin claims he tried to defuse a fight outside of the club on his way to [[7-Eleven]] (without indicating whether this was the same conflict, or something unrelated). At one point, Hopsin even offered 15 minutes of his own set to help find a solution to the problem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reporlandohiphop.com/2012/08/26/hopsin-arrested-before-performance-in-orlando-at-57-west/|access-date=2022-02-26|website=www.reporlandohiphop.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920004936/http://www.reporlandohiphop.com/2012/08/26/hopsin-arrested-before-performance-in-orlando-at-57-west/|archive-date= September 20, 2012|title=Hopsin Arrested Before Performance in Orlando at 57 West}}</ref>  Hopsin was detained shortly thereafter once police responded to the initial call stemming from the altercation inside the club.

Hopsin is against drug and alcohol usage, and has criticized how mainstream entertainers promote usage of drugs and alcohol to youth.

Hopsin has stated that he tries to be a hip hop musician who can instill positive influences in people who listen to his music.<ref name="xxlnews2"/><ref name=killerhiphop>{{cite news|url=http://www.killerhiphop.com/killerhiphop-exclusive-hopsin-interview/|title=KillerHipHop Exclusive: Hopsin Interview|date=January 17, 2012|access-date=December 19, 2012|website=KillerHipHop.com|author=Quez}}</ref> He follows a [[straight edge]] lifestyle, and has claimed to have never drunk, taken recreational drugs, or smoked.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://thenehiphop.com/hopsin-talks-slowing-down-on-diss-tracks-being-straight-edge-on-tour-his-retirement-hoax/ | title = Hopsin Talks Slowing Down On Diss Tracks, Being Straight Edge On Tour & His Retirement Hoax | website = thenehiphop.com | publication-date = July 20, 2015 | date = May 24, 2015 | access-date = August 18, 2016 | format = video | time = 1:45 | quote = Yeah, I'm straight edge, 100%, never tried, never drink, never smoke, never done any drug in my whole life. | location = Shakopee, Minnesota }}</ref>

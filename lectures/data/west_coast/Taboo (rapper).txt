==Music career==
=== 1995–present: The Black Eyed Peas ===
The Black Eyed Peas date back to 1988, when eighth-graders William Adams ([[will.i.am]]) and Allan Pineda ([[apl.de.ap]]) met and began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to [[Ruthless Records]] (run by [[Eazy-E]]) in 1992, catching the attention of Eazy-E manager, [[Jerry Heller]]'s nephew. Along with another friend of theirs, Dante Santiago, they called their band [[Atban Klann]] (ATBAN: A Tribe Beyond a Nation).<ref name="allmusic page">{{cite web|last=Kellman|first=Andy|title=The Black Eyed Peas|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-black-eyed-peas-p302855/biography|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=January 4, 2011}}</ref> Will 1X (aka will.i.am), apl.de.ap, Mookie Mook, DJ Motiv8 (aka Monroe Walker) and Dante Santiago formed Atban Klann. Their debut album, ''[[Grass Roots (Atban Klann album)|Grass Roots]]'', was never released because Ruthless founder Eazy-E had died.{{Cn|date=November 2021}}

[[File:Black Eyed Peas 2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Black Eyed Peas signing autographs before a concert at [[East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania]] in 2004]]

After Eazy-E died in 1995, Atban Klann reformed and changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and then Black Eyed Peas. Dante Santiago was replaced with Jaime Gomez (Taboo), and [[Kim Hill (soul musician)|Kim Hill]] became a steady background singer. Unlike many hip hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the [[gangsta rap]] sounds of Los Angeles-based hip hop acts at the time. Taboo is known primarily for his guttural spoken reprises of the last few words of a sung lyric, as well as emphatic flourishes between vocal parts. After being signed to [[Interscope Records]] and releasing their debut, ''[[Behind the Front]]'' (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was "[[Joints & Jam]]", and was featured on the ''[[Bulworth]]'' soundtrack. Their second album was ''[[Bridging the Gap (Black Eyed Peas album)|Bridging the Gap]]'' (2000), which had the single "[[Request + Line]]" featuring [[Macy Gray]].

In 2003, [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] became the fourth member of the group and the group gained international fame, having won six Grammy Awards and sold an estimated 75 million records worldwide. They released their third album ''[[Elephunk]]'', with the hit singles "[[Where Is the Love?]]" and "[[Shut Up (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Shut Up]]". Their 2005 album ''[[Monkey Business (The Black Eyed Peas album)|Monkey Business]]'' was a worldwide success, being certified 4× [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] in the US, and spawning the singles, "[[My Humps]]" and "[[Don't Phunk with My Heart]]".

In 2009, the group became one of only 12 artists to have simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with their singles "[[Boom Boom Pow]]" and "[[I Gotta Feeling]]", with the next single "[[Meet Me Halfway]]" achieving similar success, from the album ''[[The E.N.D]]''. These three singles topped the chart for an unprecedented 30 consecutive weeks in 2009. The album later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with "[[Imma Be]]", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album before being followed with "[[Rock That Body]]" which peaked in the Top 10 of Hot 100. "I Gotta Feeling" became the first single to sell more than 1 million downloads in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10340000/newsid_10340800/10340829.stm |work=BBC News | title=Black Eyed Peas set downloads record | date=June 21, 2010}}</ref>

The Black Eyed Peas were ranked 12th on the ''Billboard''{{'}}s Decade-End Chart Artist of the Decade, and 7th in the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. In November 2010, they released the album ''[[The Beginning (The Black Eyed Peas album)|The Beginning]]''. The first single of the album was "[[The Time (Dirty Bit)]]" and topped the charts in many countries. In February 2011, the group performed at the [[Super Bowl XLV]] [[List of Super Bowl halftime shows|halftime show]]. The album's second single was "[[Just Can't Get Enough (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]" and was released in February 2011. The music video was filmed in [[Japan]] one week before the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. The third single "[[Don't Stop the Party (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Don't Stop the Party]]" was released in May 2011. In July 2011 the group announced they were taking a break.

==Music career==

===Beginnings (1996–1999)===
Mr. J. Medeiros was born in Colorado to two East Coast parents, spending his childhood between [[Rhode Island]] and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. He got his start in the local [[battle rap]] scene performing under various pseudonyms. His first recording was made possible by a center for at-risk urban youth in [[Denver]] called, "The Spot", which featured him on their 1998 compilation album, ''Blow Up The Spot.'' His first official recording as Mr. J. Medeiros was on a song titled, "The Life of Brian", produced by [[Noel Zancanella]]. This record would appear much later on [[The Procussions]], ''Up All Night'' album. Mr. J. also DJ’d for local group, T.I.O. where he met Qq and TMAL (now known as Stro Elliot), who would later join him in The Procussions. He was also a member of the B-Boy/Girl crews T.S.F. and Bomb City Breakers.

=== The Procussions (1999–2007 / 2012–2014) ===
Mr. J. Medeiros founded [[The Procussions]] with "Qq" in Colorado Springs. The group began with five members: Mr. J. Medeiros, Stro (the 89th Key) Elliot, Rez (originally Resonant), Vise Versa and Qq (pronounced ‘Q’), with Vajra (now known as [[Chris Karns]]) as their DJ. The group became a quartet two years later when Qq was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]]. They performed throughout Colorado, opening for acts such as [[Run DMC]], [[The Pharcyde]], and [[Common (rapper)|Common]], and released two 12-inch singles, ""All That It Takes" and "Leave Her Alone", which gained distribution through ABB Records. "All That It Takes" reached No. 9 on the ''[[College Music Journal]]'' hip hop charts.<ref name="westword.com">Mayo, James (2004).

Retrieved August 23, 2013.</ref>

Based on this momentum, Mr. J. convinced the group to relocate to Los Angeles in an attempt to make their music a full-time career.<ref name="westword.com"/> Shortly after, Vise Versa left The Procussions to form the group Deux Process.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|last=Cordor|first=Cyril|title=Allmusic Artist Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/deux-process-mn0001498584/biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref>

Once in Los Angeles, The Procussions independently released their first album, ''As Iron Sharpens Iron'', through Bassmentalism Records on October 28, 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Procussions – Iron Sharpens Iron|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/as-iron-sharpens-iron-mw0000327072|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref> The album rose to No. 5 on the CMJ Hip-Hop charts.<ref>{{cite web|title=CMJ Hip Hop Chart |url=http://www.cmj.com/industry/chart_preview.php?id=5 |publisher=CMJ New Music Report |accessdate=August 24, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031127154453/http://www.cmj.com/industry/chart_preview.php?id=5 |archivedate=November 27, 2003 }}</ref> In early 2004, The Procussions released a Jazz influenced EP, ''Up All Night'', exclusively in Japan<ref>{{cite web|last=Arnold|first=Eric K.|title=The Procussions – Up All Night|url=http://www.xlr8r.com/reviews/procussions/all-night|publisher=XLR8R|accessdate=August 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027060437/http://www.xlr8r.com/reviews/procussions/all-night|archive-date=October 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Warshaw|first=Daniel C.|title=Review: Procussions – Up All Night|url=http://thebeaconhillproject.blogspot.ca/2005/07/review-procussions-up-all-night.html|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Procussions – Up All Night|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/up-all-night-mw0000469689|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}</ref>

==== The Procussions and Hocus Pocus ====
While touring France in 2004, The Procussions connected with French hip hop group [[Hocus Pocus (group)|Hocus Pocus]], beginning a longstanding relationship which has seen continued collaboration between the two groups. The Procussions have been featured on two tracks with Hocus Pocus, "Hip Hop?", from their 2005 release, ''73 Touches'' and "Vocab!", from their 2007 album, ''Place 54'', which earned them a Gold record in France.<ref name="OnandOnRecords">{{cite web|last=OnandOnRecords|title=73 Touches goes Gold: 1998–2008|url= http://www.onandon-records.com/en/content/12-label}}</ref> Mr J. and Stro were also featured on their 2010 release, ''16 Pièces'', contributing to the track, “Signes de Temps”. Mr. J. Medeiros appears as a solo artist on the song, "You", also on the ''73 Touches'' album, a tune that is originally titled, "Amelie" and featured on Mr. J.'s record ''[[Of Gods and Girls]]''.

===Mr. J. Medeiros (2007– )===
Medeiros made his solo-debut in 2007 with, ''[[Of Gods and Girls]]'' on [[Rawkus Records]]. He handled the bulk of the production himself, including "Constance," "Keep Pace," "Silent Earth," and "Call You." The album also featured guest producers, [[Symbolyc One (S1)]], [[Illmind]], [[20syl]], Stro Elliot, [[Ohmega Watts]], [[Joe Beats]], and Headnodic, with guest vocals by [[Pigeon John]], [[Strange Fruit Project]], and [[Marty James]]. The album's single, "Constance" is a tragic exposé on [[human trafficking]] and child pornography. Though the song premiered in 2004 on his [[Myspace]] page, it did not attract significant attention until the Rawkus deal and subsequent music video release. The "Constance" music video found commercial support via [[VH1]] and Mr. J.  with a guest appearance on TLC's T.V. show [[Miami Ink]] – where J. can be seen getting a "Forgive Us" tattoo. The video has been used in combination with a number of human trafficking awareness organizations and gathered enough attention to land itself on the CBS Evening News in an expo on sex trafficking. Though the video was considered by [[MTV]] to be "too controversial to air" at the time, [[MTV EXIT]] would later use it to aid in their programing. Medeiros also formed the, iamconstance.com campaign, which partnered with international non-profit organizations to fight human trafficking and sexual abuse. Medeiros received critical acclaim for, ''Of Gods and Girls'', garnering 4.5 – 5 star ratings from major Hip Hop Sites, [[HipHopDX]] and [[AllHipHop]], among others.

In early 2008, Mr. J. Medeiros signed to [[Quannum Projects]] to release his second album, ''Friends Enemies Apples Apples''. The record was produced by Stro Elliot, co-produced by Medeiros, and recorded by [[Benny Cassette]]. It also featured additional vocals from singer Tara Ellis. After an almost two-year standstill with the labels release schedule, Mr. J. formed De Medeiros, dissolved his contract with Quannum, and began releasing his material independently.

In the Spring of 2009 J. worked with Hip Hop blogs to give away an EP he recorded while waiting for the release of his sophomore LP, ''Friends Enemies Apples Apples''. The EP titled, ''The Art of Broken Glass'', is a lo-fi [[boom bap]] style record produced by Boonie Mayfield. Building on the underground buzz the EP achieved, Medeiros released his second album, ''Friends Enemies Apples Apples'' in the summer of 2009. The record landed stellar reviews in major music publications and was proceeded by a stop-motion music video for the lead single, "Holding On", created by French director Arthur King.

In early 2011 Mr. J. Medeiros was one of the first Hip Hop artists to crowd fund a records release. Working exclusively with [[Indiegogo]] for his third full-length album ''Saudade'', he handed the role of executive producer to his fans. In three months, ''Saudade'' was 257% funded, a feat landing him a mention in a [[Business Insider]] article on successful crowd sourcing. The music video for the lead single, "Neon Signs" won the [[mtvU]] Freshman Video challenge, putting it into regular rotation. ''Saudade'' introduced Mr. J.’s production team "The Stare" (consisting of Mr. J. Medeiros, Stro Elliot, and Luke Atencio) and features Jazz Trumpet player, J Kyle Gregory. The "Pale Blue Dot" EP was released in 2012 and featured production by Stro Elliot, The Stare, and 20syl and guest vocals by [[SHAD]]. Mr. J. Medeiros received an International Portuguese Music Award for best Hip Hop single, "Pale Blue Dot" 20syl remix. In 2013 Medeiros gave another EP away for free titled, ''The Rockies''. The EP was exclusively produced by Stro Elliot and featured Canadian rappers Relic and [[RationaL]]. Both EP's were made available through De Medeiros.

In 2014 Mr. J. Medeiros announced he was recording his last album as a solo artist. He partnered again with [[Indiegogo]] and successfully over-funded the production cost for the album titled ''Milk and Eggs''. Physical merchandise was exclusively distributed to contributors in late 2015. ''Milk and Eggs'' is a sample-free Hip Hop record written by Mr. J., produced by guitarist Tim Stewart, co-produced by Medeiros, and features musicians Ricky Tillo, Monte Neuble, [[George "Spanky" McCurdy]], and Stro Elliot. The Vinyl and CD were limited to 500 copies and were not made available commercially. The album saw a public digital release in Jan. 2016.

Mr. J. Medeiros continues to work as a writer and producer for other artists as well as a featured artists on other projects.

===AllttA===
In 2015 Mr. J. Medeiros and [[20syl]] formed the group AllttA,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/pays-de-la-loire/loire-atlantique/saint-nazaire/alltta-20syl-mr-jmedeiros-veulent-se-rapprocher-anges-1354719.html|title = Avec Alltta, 20syl et Mr J.Medeiros veulent se rapprocher des anges}}</ref> an Electronic-Hip Hop duo with 20syl as the producer and Mr. J. on vocals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/musiques/article/2017/11/22/avec-le-projet-alltta-le-dj-nantais-20syl-ne-se-donne-pas-de-limite_5218387_1654986.html|title = Avec le projet AllttA, le DJ 20syl " ne se donne pas de limite "|newspaper = Le Monde.fr|date = November 22, 2017}}</ref> In May 2016 their first song, "Connery" was made available through the Jakarta Records compilation, "Spring in Jakarta".
In 2017 AllttA released their debut record, "The Upper Hand", followed by the "Facing Giants" single series later that year – both on [[:fr: On and On Records]].

===thebandknives===
In 2015 Mr. J. announced he was in a Punk-Rap band named, thebandknives, with Tim Stewart and Ricky Tillo on guitars, Monte Neuble on keys, George Spanky McCurdy on drums, and himself on vocals. In 2018 the band released their debut album "KNIVES" and in 2019 their follow-up record "11110" this time with a different line up of drummers including [[George "Spanky" McCurdy]] but also adding Aaron Spears, [[Thomas Pridgen]], and Chris Johnson with Jonny Goood on bass.

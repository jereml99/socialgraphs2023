====''America's Got Talent'' and departure====
From 2009 to 2016, Cannon served as the host of ''[[America's Got Talent]]''. He announced he would not be back for 2017, citing creative differences between him and the executives of NBC. The resignation came in the wake of news that the network considered firing Cannon after he made disparaging remarks about NBC in his [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] comedy special, ''Stand Up, Don't Shoot''. "I love art and entertainment too much to watch it be ruined by controlling corporations and big business," Cannon said in a statement, referring to the cable giant [[Comcast]]'s ownership of NBC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Cannon Quits America's Got Talent After Threats of Firing over Race Joke|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/nick-cannon-quits-americas-got-talent/|website=TV Guide|date=February 13, 2017|access-date=February 13, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Cannon, however, was technically under contract to host ''America's Got Talent'' and could have been potentially sued by NBC for breach of contract, though this was considered unlikely.

==Early life==
Dom Kennedy was born on August 22, 1984, in Los Angeles, California. In an interview with music media outlet IMFlashy, Kennedy describes his childhood growing up as "normal".<ref name="Zwalkk"/> After his parents' divorce, Kennedy moved with his mother to [[Leimert Park]].<ref name="Graham, Nadine"/> Kennedy played baseball to get out of the inner city to stay safe and out of trouble. He also played basketball everyday from the age of five to the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pablo|first=J|title=Q&A: Dom Kennedy On The Yellow Album, Maybach Music Group Rumors, And Funkmaster Flex's Tupac Comments|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/07/dom_kennedy_interview.php|publisher=Village Voice|access-date=30 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021070605/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/07/dom_kennedy_interview.php|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Upon graduating from Santa Monica high school,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboombox.com/dom-kennedy-after-school-video/|title=Dom Kennedy Visits His Old High School in 'After School' Video|website=The Boombox|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref> Kennedy enrolled in [[Santa Monica College]], a two-year junior college in California, majoring in business management. In an interview with Dr. Josh Hamilton in October 2012, Dom gave his reasoning on why he entered college and what his plan B would be.

"I mainly focused on business management while I was there, not really thinking about music per se at first, but just on life. You know, like damn if I wasn't rapping or doing anything with music that was kind of where I saw myself in the world. I always hoped I could be an entrepreneur, you know I guess, but thats the aspirations of many people but I just felt like if I was going to learn about anything I might as well learn about structures of corporations, or at least find out everyone's job."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.professu.com/dom-kennedy-best-rapper-alive/ |title=Dom Kennedy: The Best Rapper Alive ‹ Professu |website=Professu.com |access-date=2016-01-04}}</ref>

==Music career==
Working with his cousin Jason Madison,<ref name="Graham, Nadine"/> Kennedy released his debut mixtape album ''25th Hour'' in 2008, instantly producing a buzz throughout the south side of L.A. In particular, the song "Watermelon Sundae" was widely played on local radio stations and performed live throughout the area, bringing more attention to Kennedy's music ambitions. Around this time, Kennedy's cousin Madison was a film student at [[Loyola Marymount University]],<ref name="Graham, Nadine"/> sparking the beginning importance of visuals in Kennedy's later projects.

After his ''25th Hour'' debut, Kennedy released 2 additional mixtapes in 2009; ''Best After Bobby'' (the title referring to "Bobby" [[Robert F. Kennedy]]), and ''Future Street/Drug Sounds''. For the ''Best After Bobby'' mixtape, Kennedy collaborated with West Coast heavy hitter DJ Sour Milk and the Los Angeles Leakers, producing an instant buzz in underground circles across the country.<ref name="3rd Eye Drops">{{cite web|url=http://3rdeyedrops.wordpress.com/2010/04/03/support-the-homies-dom-kennedy/ |title=SUPPORT THE HOMIES: DOm Kennedy &#124; 3rd Eye Drops |website=3rdeyedrops.wordpress.com |date=2010-04-03 |access-date=2016-01-04}}</ref> Within the first hours of dropping the mixtape, Kennedy amassed over 10,000 downloads,<ref name="3rd Eye Drops"/> officially solidifying his name among some of the top rappers in L.A.

However, with the release of ''From the Westside With Love'' in 2010, Kennedy became a major hit throughout the underground hip hop scene in L.A. Gaining over 100,000 internet downloads,<ref name="South by Southwest">{{cite web|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_MS13032 |access-date=June 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319120316/http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_MS13032 |archive-date=March 19, 2011 |title=Dom Kennedy}}</ref> With the success of ''From the Westside With Love'', Kennedy became a major player on the independent circuit, traveling for performances throughout and outside the country; including a show in [[Djibouti]], [[Africa]].<ref name="Gipson, Brooklyne"/> Kennedy also began releasing an extensive amount of visual material at this time, including ''From the Westside With Love'' music videos for songs such as "1997", "Locals Only", and "The 4 Heartbeats".

In early 2011, Kennedy released his 5th studio mixtape ''The Original Dom Kennedy'', a tape meant to reflect Kennedy's individuality and sound as an artist. In an interview with [[MTV]] News reporter James Lacsina, Kennedy described the project as something that was a testament to himself in the rap game as well as the city he proudly represents:

{{blockquote|text=With ''The Original Dom Kennedy'', it was a time for me to take a stand in music. The way we grew up and our lifestyle, being kids from the inner city of Los Angeles. I just felt like that was missing.|author=Dom Kennedy|source=from an interview with Brooklyn Gipsone}}

Kennedy also took a personal stance in the mixtape against major hip hop DJ and producer [[Funkmaster Flex]].<ref name="Gipson, Brooklyne"/> On his song "The Homies", Kennedy takes shots at Flex's disparaging remarks regarding the late California rapper [[Tupac Shakur]]: "Shit I heard Funk Flex say that Pac ain't shit/ and I hope when you see him that he slap your mouth/"
In 2011, Kennedy performed at premier [[film festival]] [[South by Southwest]]'s Music Matters Show in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. The show was hosted by cable entertainment network [[Black Entertainment Television]].<ref name="Dom Kennedy">{{cite web |author=SXSW |url=http://www.thesource.com/articles/54346/SXSW---J.Cole-%26-Dom-Kennedy-Perform-at-BET%27s-Music-Matters-Showcase-?thesource-prod=uu9qd01sr4m9recs9gkr479bj2 |title=Archive |website=archive.is |date=2011-03-18 |access-date=2017-04-14 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130204065817/http://www.thesource.com/articles/54346/SXSW---J.Cole-%26-Dom-Kennedy-Perform-at-BET's-Music-Matters-Showcase-?thesource-prod=uu9qd01sr4m9recs9gkr479bj2 |archive-date=2013-02-04 }}</ref> Both his performance and that of [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast]] rapper [[J.

==Influences==
Kennedy is often heard proclaiming his hometown rep one liner "Leimert Park what's cool". As a kid, Kennedy describes himself as being highly influenced by artists such as "[[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Outkast]], [[2Pac]], and [[LL Cool J]]"<ref name="Zwalkk"/> through the fact that by simply listening to their music, he could feel a sense of where they were from. With his music, Kennedy does the same thing, bringing the feel of the inner city streets of L.A. to anyone willing to listen. In an interview with Hip Hop DX, Kennedy talks about the influence behind the L.A. sound in his music:

{{blockquote|text=If anything, and I can only speak for myself, I think that I’m trying to do it like [[DJ Quik]] did it, or [[Ice Cube]] did it, but this is just my way of doing it therefore I guess it’s natural. But I’m not trying to do anything, you know, different or to say, ‘This is new.’... I set out to do it the way they did it, just in my own way.|author=Dom Kennedy|source=from an interview with Nadine Graham<ref name="Graham, Nadine">{{cite web|last=Graham |first=Nadine |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/dxnext/id.193/title.dxnext-dom-kennedy |title=DXnext: Dom Kennedy |publisher=HipHopDX |date=2011-02-03 |access-date=2016-01-04}}</ref>

'''Yolanda Whitaker''', also known as '''Yo-Yo''' (born August 4, 1971)<ref>{{cite web|author=Ron Wynn |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yo-yo-mn0000961152/biography |title=Yo-Yo &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=August 4, 1971 |access-date=August 11, 2014}}</ref> is an American rapper and actress.

Much of Yo-Yo's music advocates [[Women's empowerment|female empowerment]]. She is the [[Mentorship|protégé]] of gangsta rapper [[Ice Cube]]. Yo-Yo has dubbed her crew the IBWC, Intelligent Black Woman's Coalition.<ref>"SUMMER SPLASH III". (May 26, 1991). ''L.A. Times'', p. 50</ref>

==Career==

===Music===
Yo-Yo first appeared as a guest on [[Ice Cube]]'s 1990 debut studio album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' on the track "It's a Man's World".<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|pages=372/3}}</ref> Cube returned the favor by appearing on "You Can't Play with My Yo-Yo", on Yo-Yo's 1991 debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Each of the videos for the singles from the album were directed by Okuwah Garrett of Power Films.

Her follow-up album released in 1992, ''[[Black Pearl (Yo-Yo album)|Black Pearl]]'',<ref name="LarkinDM"/> was well received by critics,<ref name=r1>Abdul-Adil, Jaleel (August 1, 1993), "Yo Yo and MC Lyte Turn Tables on Male Rappers",  ''Chicago Sun-Times'', p. 9</ref> partly because of its focus on positive messages and uplifting themes that heavily contrasted with the popular [[gangsta rap]] style at the time.<ref name=r1/> Despite a plethora of renowned producers such as [[DJ Muggs]], this failed to translate into a hit with mainstream hip-hop audiences, and the album's sales were considered a disappointment.<ref name=r1/>

Less than a year later, Yo-Yo released her follow-up album, titled ''[[You Better Ask Somebody]]''.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The final track on the album was her third recorded hip-hop duet with [[Ice Cube]], "The Bonnie and Clyde Theme".<ref name="LarkinDM"/> 

Yo-Yo's next album, ''[[Total Control (Yo-Yo album)|Total Control]]'', was released in 1996.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> In 1998, Yo-Yo finished her fifth studio album, ''[[Ebony (album)|Ebony]]'', though it was not released. In 2008, her single, "You Can't Play With My Yo-Yo" was ranked number 92 on VH1's 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stereogum.com/archives/vh1s-100-greatest-hiphop-songs_024391.html |title=VH1′s 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs |publisher=Stereogum |date=September 29, 2008 |access-date=April 9, 2012}}</ref> Later that year, she performed with [[MC Lyte]], [[The Lady of Rage]], and [[Salt-N-Pepa]] at the [[BET Hip Hop Awards]]. She also performed on the Arsenio Hall show in 1994 alongside many other famous rappers and rap groups. Yo-Yo opened up the show and was later followed by rappers and groups like Naughty by Nature, A Tribe Called Quest and Wu-Tang Clan. 

As of 2009, Yo-Yo has been working on an EP, titled ''My Journey to Fearless: The Black Butterfly''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.singersroom.com/lifestyle/124/Icons-Speak-Yo-Yo-Talks-Keri-Hilson-Female-Emcees-and-Journey-To-Fearless |title=Lifestyle &#124; Icons Speak: YoYo Talks Keri Hilson, Female Emcees, more |website=Singersroom.com |date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=April 9, 2012}}</ref>

'''Jayceon Terrell Taylor''' (born November 29, 1979), better known by his stage name <!--"the" lowercase is correct - see [[MOS:NICKNAMETHE]]-->'''the Game''' or simply '''Game''', is an American rapper. Born in [[Compton, California]], he initially released a series of [[mixtape]]s under the wing of fellow West Coast rapper [[JT the Bigga Figga]]. After releasing his debut independent album ''[[Untold Story (album)|Untold Story]]'' in 2004, he was eventually discovered by record producer [[Dr. Dre]] and signed to his [[Aftermath Records]] label imprint. The Game rose to fame in 2005 with the success of his major-label debut album ''[[The Documentary]]'' and found continued success with the 2006 follow-up ''[[Doctor's Advocate]]''. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] certified ''The Documentary'' Double Platinum in March 2005.

A rising artist in the 2000s, the Game was considered to be a driving force in bringing back the West Coast hip hop scene into the mainstream and competing with many of his [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast counterparts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/blogs/news/archive/2005/02/18/18129758.aspx |title=XXL Spotlights West Coast Hip-Hop In March Issue |author=Clover Hope |date=February 18, 2007 |publisher=Allhiphop |access-date=July 20, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106065519/http://allhiphop.com/blogs/news/archive/2005/02/18/18129758.aspx |archive-date=November 6, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dubcnn.com/features/editorials/2005wrapup/ |title= The West Coast Rap Up: 2005 |author= Conan Milne |year= 2005 |publisher= Dubcnn |access-date= January 27, 2007 |archive-date= November 7, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151107053104/http://www.dubcnn.com/features/editorials/2005wrapup/ |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/Music/GAME+Playtime+Is+Over.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished |title=XXL Game: Playtime Is Over |author=Kim Osorio |date=March 21, 2006 |publisher=BET |access-date=October 8, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324060932/http://www.bet.com/Music/GAME%2BPlaytime%2BIs%2BOver.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished |archive-date=March 24, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Game was placed into [[G-Unit]] by Dr. Dre and [[Jimmy Iovine]]. As a result of his disputes with [[50 Cent]], Game left Aftermath and signed with [[Geffen Records|Geffen]], another label under [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]'s [[Interscope Geffen A&M]] unit, to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit in the summer of 2006. The Game's second major label album ''Doctor's Advocate'' was released on November 14, 2006, and it became his second album to debut at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. ''Doctor's Advocate'' did not feature any production from Dr. Dre. [[Pitchfork Media]] placed ''The Documentary'' at number 35 on their list of Top 50 Albums of 2005. The Game was nominated with a total of two nominations, including Grammy Award for Best Rap Song and Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for the smash single "[[Hate It or Love It]]". ''[[The New York Times]]'' named ''Doctor's Advocate'' best hip-hop album of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |date=November 9, 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/09/arts/music/09sann.html |title=Repentant Yet Defiant, a Rapper at His Best |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=November 9, 2006 |archive-date=January 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115235529/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/09/arts/music/09sann.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

His next album ''[[LAX (album)|LAX]]'' was released in 2008. With his fourth studio album ''[[The R.E.D. Album]]'', the Game again debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200. In addition to music, the Game has starred in motion pictures and founded [[The Black Wall Street Records]]. In September 2011, the Game started working on his fifth studio album, ''[[Jesus Piece (album)|Jesus Piece]]'', which was released on December 11, 2012, his final album released by Interscope.

== Music career ==

=== Early career (2002–2003) ===
While recovering in the hospital from gunshot wounds he incurred in late 2001, Game told his brother to go out and buy all of the classic hip-hop albums. Over the course of five months, he studied all of the various influential rap albums and developed a strategy to turn himself into a rapper. With the help of his older brother [[Big Fase]], they founded the label. It originally featured such artists as [[Glasses Malone]], Vita, and Nu Jerzey Devil, along with Game himself.<ref name="Shadows 3">{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |title=The Game: Out Of The Shadows |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/game/news_feature_012705/index3.jhtml |publisher=MTV |date=January 27, 2005 |access-date=August 10, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927033743/http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/game/news_feature_012705/index3.jhtml |archive-date=September 27, 2008 }}</ref> His [[stage name]] was coined by his grandmother, who was a huge fan of the 1997 blockbuster, [[The Game (1997 film)|''The Game'']].<ref name="Shadows 3" /> Game first gained prominence when he attended a hip-hop summit hosted by [[Russell Simmons]] and [[Louis Farrakhan]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Larkin |first=Colin |editor=Colin Larkin |title=Encyclopedia of Popular Music |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofp003lark |url-access=registration |orig-year=1992  |edition=3 |date=November 1998 |publisher=Grove's Dictionaries |isbn=978-1-56159-237-1 |page=6653}}</ref> After he had fully recovered, Game and Big Fase made a mixtape together. He released his first mixtape ''You Know What It Is Vol. 1'' in 2002, and landed a record deal with the independent label [[Get Low Recordz]] owned by [[JT the Bigga Figga]].

Game's mixtape reached the hands of [[Sean Combs]], founder of [[Bad Boy Records]], who originally was on the verge of signing him to his label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1495949/01162005/game_the.jhtml |title=The Game on Bad Boy?

Game made his first cameo appearance in the music video for 50 Cent's "[[In da Club]]", where he is seen dancing with a girl. Since then, he has made numerous cameo appearances in music videos by 50 Cent, [[Lloyd Banks]], [[Young Buck]], and [[Fabolous]]. Game spent the next two and a half years working on his major label debut album and being mentored by Dr. Dre.<ref name="Shadows 3" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/arts/music/27leeds.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&oref=slogin|title=Scenes From an Arranged Marriage|last=Leeds|first=Jeff|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 27, 2005|access-date=October 5, 2007|archive-date=October 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006010054/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/arts/music/scenes-from-an-arranged-marriage.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== ''The Documentary'' (2003–2005) ===
[[File:Kool G Rap & The Game.jpg|thumb|Game (right) with [[Kool G Rap]] (left) in New York City, November 2004]]
Not having dropped an album despite being signed onto Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records for a while, Game was still able to create hype around his image alone. He appeared in ads for [[Sean Combs]]'s [[Sean John]] clothing company and had an endorsement deal with [[Boost Mobile (United States)|Boost Mobile]], appearing in a commercial alongside [[Kanye West]] and [[Ludacris]]. Game also appeared heavily on the mixtape circuit and guest starred on mixtapes for [[DJ Green Lantern]], [[The Diplomats]], and [[G-Unit]]. The first single released with Game on it was "[[Certified Gangstas]]", which also featured [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]] and [[Cam'ron]]. Though the single wasn't considered to be mainstream, the buzz increased around the West Coast rapper.

On September 28, 2004, Game released his first promo single, "[[Westside Story (song)|Westside Story]]", from his major label debut album. He had originally chosen to title the album ''Nigga Wit' An Attitude Volume 1'' (as heard in the lyrics to "[[Dreams (The Game song)|Dreams]]"), but an [[injunction]] filed at the request of [[Eazy-E]]'s widow prevented him from using [[N.W.A]]'s name in the album title. Thus, the album was titled ''The Documentary'', which featured Dr. Dre and 50 Cent as executive producers. The album spawned the hit [[single (music)|singles]] "[[How We Do (song)|How We Do]]" and "[[Hate It or Love It]]", the latter receiving two Grammy nominations.<ref name="Grammy 2006">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/awards/grammys/2005-12-08-grammy-list-nominations_x.htm|title=Complete list of Grammy Award nominations|date=December 8, 2005|work=USA Today|access-date=September 16, 2017|archive-date=April 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426205746/http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/awards/grammys/2005-12-08-grammy-list-nominations_x.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The album debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was the sixteenth best selling album of 2005 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2005/top-billboard-200-albums|title=TOP BILLBOARD 200 ALBUMS|date=January 2006|publisher=Billboard|access-date=February 6, 2019|archive-date=December 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227214858/https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2005/top-billboard-200-albums|url-status=live}}</ref> It also debuted at number seven in the United Kingdom and sold over five million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/09-26-2006/0004439649&EDATE= |title= The Game Continues |date= October 26, 2006 |publisher= PRNewswire |access-date= January 26, 2007 |archive-date= September 17, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080917002721/http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F09-26-2006%2F0004439649&EDATE= |url-status= live }}</ref> In October 2004, he released ''[[Untold Story (album)|Untold Story]]'' through Get Low Recordz, which sold over 82,000 copies within its first three months.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/64382/the-games-documentary-blasts-off-at-no-1 |title=The Game's 'Documentary' Blasts Off At No. 1 |last=Whitmire |first=Margo |date=January 26, 2005 |magazine=Billboard |access-date=January 25, 2007 |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704011901/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/64382/the-games-documentary-blasts-off-at-no-1 |url-status=live }}</ref> The album featured artists like [[Sean T (rapper)|Sean T]], [[Young Noble]] (of the [[Outlawz]]), and JT the Bigga Figga.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.last.fm/music/The+Game/Untold+Story |title= Untold Story – The Game |access-date= January 26, 2007 |archive-date= November 7, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151107053302/http://www.last.fm/music/The+Game/Untold+Story |url-status= live }}</ref> Game also appeared on various mixtapes hosted by DJ's such as [[DJ Kayslay]], [[DJ Whoo Kid]], and [[DJ Clue]].

Later that year, the young rapper [[Lil Eazy-E]], son of rapper the late [[Eazy-E]], entered a feud with Game. The two used to be close associates and recorded music together. Lil' Eazy-E has since directed numerous diss songs targeting the rapper and has expressed his anger over what he felt was Game's misuse of his father's name. Game responded by claiming that Lil' Eazy-E was trying to establish himself off the success he had made since releasing ''The Documentary''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=1280 |title= The Game Releases Statement on Beef |author=The Game |date=November 2005 |access-date=July 27, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060204211404/http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=1280 |archive-date = February 4, 2006}}</ref> He released a song titled "120 Bars" where he claimed that Lil' Eazy-E does not write his own lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illhill.com/article.asp?topic_id=698 |title=Exclusive ILLHILL.com Lil' Eazy Interview |access-date=January 26, 2007 |first=Dominic |last=de Haas |date=January 2006 |publisher=Ill Hill |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928032205/http://www.illhill.com/article.asp?topic_id=698 |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref> However, on the same track, Game stated that he would rather not feud with Lil' Eazy-E due to the deep respect he has for Lil' Eazy-E's father. Lil' Eazy-E later responded with "They Know Me". On October 30, 2006, Game went on [[KDAY]] and said that he and Lil' Eazy-E had ended their feud.

Dr. Dre's nemesis, [[Suge Knight]], also had an ongoing feud with Game that stemmed from Yukmouth's claim that Game had been slapped by Suge Knight. Game responded on his website, saying that if Suge Knight had ever touched him, he would be "six feet under".{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} After the 2005 [[BET Awards]] show, associates of [[Death Row Records]] had their invitations to a party hosted by [[Ciara]] rescinded.

=== ''Doctor's Advocate'' and feud with G-Unit (2005–2007) ===
[[File:TheGameApr2011.jpg|thumb|Game performing at Supafest 2011]]

In early 2005, Game entered a feud with G-Unit. Even before Game's major label debut was released and their feud became public, there was tension between Game and 50 Cent.<ref>March 2005 issue of ''Vibe'' magazine. The interview asks about Game's and 50 Cent's physical altercation.</ref> Soon after ''The Documentary'''s release, 50 Cent talked about an accident that occurred in the [[strip club]] by stating that he felt that the rapper's actions of not partnering with [[50 Cent]] to react to [[Fat Joe]] and [[Jadakiss]] after the [[New York (Ja Rule song)|New York]] song written by [[Ja Rule]] were wrong and then booted Game out of [[G-Unit]]. 50 Cent also claimed that he was not getting his proper credit for the creation of the album, as he had written six of the songs, all of which Game denied. During that dispute, a member of Game's entourage was shot during a confrontation that occurred at the [[WQHT|Hot 97]] studio in New York City.<ref name=Beef>{{cite web |url= http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=4129  |title= Update: Man Shot Not With 50 Cent; Violator Offices Shot Up |access-date= July 27, 2007 | first= Jayson | last = Rodriguez |date=March 1, 2005 |publisher=AllHipHop |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050306234231/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=4129 |archive-date = March 6, 2005}}</ref> After the situation between them escalated, 50 Cent and Game held a press conference to announce their reconciliation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/blogs/news/archive/2005/03/09/18129811.aspx |title=AHH Special: 50 Cent and Game's Truce |access-date=July 27, 2007 |first=Alvin |last=Blanco |date=March 9, 2005 |publisher=AllHipHop |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101043543/http://allhiphop.com/blogs/news/archive/2005/03/09/18129811.aspx |archive-date=November 1, 2007 }}</ref> Fans had mixed feelings as to whether the rappers created a publicity stunt to boost the sales of the two albums the pair had just released.<ref name=Beef /> Nevertheless, even after the situation had apparently deflated,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/blogs/features/archive/2005/05/09/18133221.aspx |title=Game: Winds of Change |access-date=July 27, 2007 |first=Houston |last=Williams |date=May 9, 2005 |publisher=Allhiphop |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101043528/http://allhiphop.com/blogs/features/archive/2005/05/09/18133221.aspx |archive-date=November 1, 2007 }}</ref> G-Unit continued to feud with Game, denouncing his street credibility in the media and claimed that, without their support, he would not score a hit if he made a second album. Game responded during a performance at [[Summer Jam (festival)|Summer Jam]] and launched a boycott of G-Unit called "G-Unot".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=4469 |title=The Game Taunts 50 Cent, Jay-Z Returns At Hot 97's Summer Jam|access-date=July 27, 2007| first=Jayson | last= Rodriguez|date=June 6, 2005|publisher=AllHipHop |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050617073858/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=4469 |archive-date = June 17, 2005}}</ref>

After the performance at Summer Jam, Game responded with a song titled "300 Barz and Running'", an extended "diss" aimed at G-Unit as well as members of [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] on the mixtape ''You Know What It Is Vol. 3''. The track is unique in that it is nearly 14 minutes long, in which Game criticizes all members of G-Unit, amongst many others. 50 Cent responded through his "[[Piggy Bank (song)|Piggy Bank]]" music video, which features Game as a [[Mr. Potato Head]] doll and also parodies other rivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.3445/title.50-strikes-back-in-piggy-bank-video|title=50 Strikes Back in "Piggy Bank" Video|access-date=January 29, 2007|last=Springer|first=Anthony Jr.|date=August 5, 2005|publisher=HipHopDX|archive-date=January 20, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120175453/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.3445/title.50-strikes-back-in-piggy-bank-video|url-status=live}}</ref> Since then, both groups continued to attack each other. Game released two more mixtapes, ''Ghost Unit'' and a mixtape/DVD called ''[[Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin]]''. 50 Cent's rebuttal was "Not Rich, Still Lyin'" where he mocks Game.<ref name=240Bars>{{cite web|url=http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/8275 |title=The Game takes on Spider Loc, 50 Cent strikes back |access-date=January 28, 2007 |author=Carl Chery |author2=Jesse Gissen |date=February 3, 2006 |publisher=Sohh |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123041115/http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/8275 |archive-date=January 23, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, G-Unit started to respond on numerous mixtapes and then-new G-Unit member [[Spider Loc]] began dissing Game. Game responded with "240 Bars (Spider Joke)",<ref name=240Bars /> a song mainly aimed at Spider Loc, but also addressing [[Tony Yayo]] and rap group [[M.O.P.]],<ref name=240Bars /> and on the song "The Funeral 100 Bars".

The feud between Game and [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] grew out of an earlier rivalry with [[Memphis Bleek]] over the name of his label ([[Get Low Records]]), which was similar to the one Game was previously signed to ([[Get Low Recordz]]). On the single "[[Westside Story (song)|Westside Story]]", Game raps that "I don't do button-up shirts or drive [[Maybach]]s", which was perceived as being directed towards [[Jay-Z]], though Game stated it was directed toward [[Ja Rule]]. Later Jay-Z performed a freestyle on [[Funkmaster Flex]]'s radio show on Hot 97 and in it, he repeatedly used the word ''game'', which some hip hop fans{{Who|date=July 2017}} believed was directed towards Game. Game responded with "My Bitch" in which the first verse is directed at [[G-Unit]], the second verse is directed at [[Jay-Z]] and the third verse at [[Suge Knight]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=4077 |title=Game Says No Beef With Jay-Z, Speaks on Amsterdam Comments|access-date=July 27, 2007| first= Clover | last =Hope |date=February 14, 2005|publisher=AllHipHop |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050226070341/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=4077 |archive-date = February 26, 2005}}</ref>

[[File:The Game - Hip Hop Jam.jpg|thumb|Game performing at the 2007 Hip Hop Jam festival in the [[Czech Republic]]]]
Due to his disputes with 50 Cent, Game left [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and signed with [[Geffen Records]] another label under [[Universal Music Group]]'s [[Interscope-Geffen-A&M]] division to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit in the summer of 2006. The rapper's second major-label album ''[[Doctor's Advocate]]'' was released on November 14, 2006. This album was set out by Game to prove that he was still able to make good music and be a successful artist without the help of Dr. Dre or 50 Cent. While Game originally claimed Dr. Dre would still do production on the album in the November issue of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://xxlmag.com/online/?p=5019 |title= Man Up |access-date= January 26, 2007 |first= Kawan |last= Ari |date= September 28, 2006 |publisher= XXL |archive-date= May 1, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501093002/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=5019 |url-status= dead }}</ref> he admitted in September after the ''XXL'' interview was conducted during an interview on radio station [[Power 105]] that Dr. Dre would not be producing any tracks<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/Music/musicnews928.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished |title=Daily Music News Wrap Up |access-date=January 26, 2007 |first=Kim |last=Osorio |date=September 28, 2006 |publisher=BET.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330004426/http://www.bet.com/Music/musicnews928.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished |archive-date=March 30, 2007 }}</ref> although four previously unreleased tracks produced by Dr. Dre were released on the Internet, but no reason was given as to why they were not included on the album.

In October 2006, Game extended a peace treaty to 50 Cent, which was not immediately replied to.<ref>Fresh, Remmie (September 30, 2006).

On Game's album ''Doctor's Advocate'', he says the feud is over on a few of the songs. The feud seemed to have gained steam after Tony Yayo allegedly slapped the fourteen-year-old son of [[Czar Entertainment]] CEO Jimmy Rosemond. Game responded with "Body Bags" on ''You Know What It Is Vol. 4''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=6893 |title= The Game Breaks Silence on Manager's Son's Assault, Releases Track Aimed at G-Unit |access-date=July 20, 2007 |last=Wolfe|first=Roman |date= April 3, 2007 |publisher=AllHipHop |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406235703/http://allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=6893 |archive-date = April 6, 2007}}</ref>
Since Young Buck was dismissed from G-Unit by 50 Cent, there have been interviews from both Game and Young Buck stating they never had a problem with each other.

=== ''LAX'' and ''The R.E.D. Album'' (2007–2012) ===
Game appeared on ''[[106 & Park]]'' on May 16, where he confirmed ''[[LAX (album)|LAX]]'' would be the last studio album he records. He had originally announced that [[Dr. Dre]] would be producing for the album, but neither Dr. Dre nor Aftermath Entertainment had confirmed. The album went head to head with [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]]'s ''[[All Hope Is Gone]]'' on the ''Billboard''&nbsp;200 albums chart, seeing that both albums were released on August 22, 2008, therefore both albums were competing for the number one spot on the ''Billboard''&nbsp;200. ''LAX'' ended up debuting at number two on the ''Billboard''&nbsp;200, at first, it looked like ''LAX'' had debuted ahead of ''All Hope Is Gone'' by 13 copies. Initially, ''Billboard'' published an article stating that the Game had secured the top spot with a margin of 13&nbsp;units, in what was described as the "closest race for number one since [[Nielsen SoundScan]] began tracking Data in 1991".<ref name="MusicWeek">{{cite web |last= Jones |first= Alan |title= Slipknot claim first US number one, after chart mix up |work= [[Music Week]] |date= September 5, 2008 |url= http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1035404&c=1 |access-date= September 6, 2008 |archive-date= September 10, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910075412/http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1035404&c=1 |url-status= live }}</ref> Slipknot's labels [[Warner Music Group]] and [[Roadrunner Records]] asked for a SoundScan recount, a historic first.

After the recount 12&nbsp;hours later, the article was rewritten and Slipknot was awarded the number one spot.<ref name="MusicWeek" /> ''LAX'' spawned four singles: "[[Game's Pain]]" with R&B singer [[Keyshia Cole]], "[[Dope Boys]]" with [[Blink-182]] drummer [[Travis Barker]], "[[My Life (The Game song)|My Life]]" with rapper [[Lil Wayne]] and "[[Camera Phone (song)|Camera Phone]]" with R&B singer [[Ne-Yo]].

Before he could, Snoop's bodyguards grabbed him and he was beaten unconscious by crewmembers, including the rapper and producer [[Soopafly]]; Snoop and Game were included in the suit for not intervening. The lawsuit focuses on a pecuniary claim of $22&nbsp;million in punitive and [[compensatory damages]], [[battery (tort)|battery]], [[negligence]], and [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xxlmag.com/online/?p=1172 |title=XXL Magazine Snoop Dogg, Dogg Pound and The Game Sued for Concert Assault |publisher=XXL |access-date=August 6, 2011 |archive-date=October 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004030924/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=1172 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The concerned parties appeared in court in April 2009.{{Update inline|date=July 2017}}

On October 28, 2005, Game was charged with [[disorderly conduct]] and resisting arrest in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[North Carolina]].

===2007 trial on assault and weapons charges===
On May 11, 2007, Game was arrested at his home, reportedly in connection with an incident at a basketball game in [[South Los Angeles]] in February 2007. He is alleged to have threatened a person with a gun. The arrest took place after his home was searched for three hours. Game was released early the next day after posting $50,000 bail.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1559453/20070512/game_the.jhtml?rsspartner=rssFeedBurner |title= Game Arrested On Threat Charge |access-date= May 16, 2007 |date= May 12, 2007 |publisher= MTV News |archive-date= September 30, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930230310/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1559453/20070512/game_the.jhtml?rsspartner=rssFeedBurner |url-status= live }}</ref> On January 9, 2008, a Los Angeles judge scheduled February 4 as the beginning date for Game's trial on assault and weapons charges.<ref>Black widow (January 9, 2008).

===2011 controversies===
In 2011, Game was refused entry to Canada for alleged gang ties in Los Angeles; concert organisers said he was associated with the [[Bloods (gang)|Bloods]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/1/20110423/ten-the-game-denied-entry-into-canada-ov-c60bd6d.html |access-date=April 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428204201/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/1/20110423/ten-the-game-denied-entry-into-canada-ov-c60bd6d.html |title=The Game denied entry into Canada over 'gang ties'|archive-date=April 28, 2011 }}</ref>

On August 12, 2011, the Game decided to tweet his search for a supposed internship opening. In the message sent to his over 580,000 followers, he posted the number to call as the emergency line for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. The Game's fans jammed the line for hours. Initially, the Game denied any wrongdoing, saying the tweet was "a mistake". The Game then posted a message saying the sheriff's department can "track a tweet down but you can't solve murders!" A criminal investigation was launched stating that the Game could be charged for obstruction of justice. Despite all of this, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department issued this statement: "Based upon our investigation, as well as consultation with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, the LASD considers the criminal investigation into this matter closed. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will not be seeking criminal charges." The Game issued an apology on CNN saying, "My sincerest apologies to the Sheriff's Department, it was a joke gone wrong."

===2012 physical altercation with 40 Glocc===
On July 8, 2012, [[40 Glocc]] got into an altercation with the Game. In a video clip, allegedly shot by the Game via Game's iPhone during the fight, 40 Glocc is seen running into a bush after being beaten up by the fellow West Coast rapper.<ref>{{cite web |last=Langhorne |first=Cyrus |url=http://www.sohh.com/2012/07/40_glocc_accuses_game_of_altering_fight.html |title=40 Glocc Accuses Game Of Altering Fight Video, "All That Footage Is Edited" [Audio |publisher=Sohh |date=July 11, 2012 |access-date=November 8, 2012 |archive-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116144112/http://www.sohh.com/2012/07/40_glocc_accuses_game_of_altering_fight.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Jacobs |first=Allen |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.20352/title.game-entourage-reportedly-fight-40-glocc-in-los-angeles-film-released |title=Game & Entourage Reportedly Fight 40 Glocc In Los Angeles, Film Released  |publisher=HipHopDX |date=July 8, 2012 |access-date=April 5, 2013 |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116070753/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.20352/title.game-entourage-reportedly-fight-40-glocc-in-los-angeles-film-released |url-status=live }}</ref> Game defended what he did by saying he was retaliating for Glocc going up to rappers [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Plies (rapper)|Plies]] in the past with large entourages.<ref name="www.hiphopdx.com">{{cite web | last = Burgess | first = Omar | title = Game Confirms Fighting With 40 Glocc And "Jesus Piece" Artwork | date = October 30, 2012 | url = http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.21700/title.game-confirms-fighting-with-40-glocc-and-jesus-piece-artwork | publisher = HipHopDX | access-date = October 31, 2012 | archive-date = November 2, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121102052907/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.21700/title.game-confirms-fighting-with-40-glocc-and-jesus-piece-artwork | url-status = live }}</ref> In October 2012, 40 Glocc filed a lawsuit for $4.54 million for [[assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]], as well as damaging his reputation. This included $500,000 in pain and suffering; $500,000 in emotional distress; $750,000 in lost earnings; $2 million for punitive damages; $25,000 in medical expenses; and various other reasons. Since then, Glocc has gone on a smear campaign against the Game, releasing his diss "The Full Edit" in December 2012. Game has similarly addressed the situation in several interviews, claiming that filing a lawsuit of this nature "disintegrates your street cred".<ref>{{cite web |last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.23154/title.40-glocc-suing-game-for-4-5-million-over-assault |title=40 Glocc Suing Game For $4.5 Million Over Assault  |publisher=HipHop DX |date=March 11, 2013 |access-date=April 5, 2013 |archive-date=March 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314021040/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.23154/title.40-glocc-suing-game-for-4-5-million-over-assault |url-status=live }}</ref> In December 2012, 40 Glocc assaulted Game's manager Dontay "Taydoe" Kidd in Las Vegas, Nevada.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ryon |first=Sean |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22397/title.40-glocc-reportedly-assaults-games-manager |title=40 Glocc Reportedly Assaults Game's Manager  |publisher=HipHopDX |date=January 1, 2013 |access-date=April 5, 2013 |archive-date=May 27, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527232127/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22397/title.40-glocc-reportedly-assaults-games-manager |url-status=live }}</ref> Glocc won the lawsuit and was awarded $3000.

===2016 sexual assault case===
In 2016, a judge ruled that the Game was liable for sexually assaulting Priscilla Rainey, then a contestant on ''[[She's Got Game|She Got Game]]'', a [[VH1]] reality show starring the Game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/jury-reportedly-finds-the-game-liable-in-sexual-assault-lawsuit-news.25586.html |title=The Game held liable for sexual assault of "She Got Game" contestant Priscilla Rainey |last=Smith |first=Trevor |date=November 19, 2016 |publisher=Hotnewhiphop |access-date=November 19, 2016 |archive-date=November 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120084245/http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/jury-reportedly-finds-the-game-liable-in-sexual-assault-lawsuit-news.25586.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Rainey claimed she had agreed to go on a date with the Game, believing it would be on camera; however, when she met the rapper at a Chicago restaurant, there was allegedly no production&nbsp;crew.&nbsp;The lawsuit further alleged&nbsp;the Game showed up to the date "highly intoxicated on alcohol and drugs (which was typical), and sexually assaulted the plaintiff [Rainey] on several occasions that night. This included him forcefully reaching his hand inside her dress to rub her bare vagina and buttocks".<ref name="Complex Seize" /> 

In 2019, an appellate court affirmed the entire $7.1 million judgment.<ref>Rainey v. Taylor, Nos. 16-4153 & 18-2990 (7th Cir. Oct. 17, 2019), http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2019/D10-17/C:18-2990:J:Sykes:aut:T:fnOp:N:2415468:S:0 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213101653/http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2019%2FD10-17%2FC%3A18-2990%3AJ%3ASykes%3Aaut%3AT%3AfnOp%3AN%3A2415468%3AS%3A0 |date=February 13, 2020 }}</ref> However, according to Rainey, the rapper&nbsp;failed to paid her any money in the years since she received the judgement. Rainey subsequently filed a [[motion (legal)|motion]], requesting the seizure of the Game's income, and in April 2020, she was granted ownership&nbsp;of the Game's&nbsp;independent record label Prolific Records, as well as [[royalty payment|royalties]] from his 2019 album,&nbsp;''[[Born 2 Rap]]''. This resulted in Rainey gaining full control over any salary the Game would receive through his imprint label, which was launched in late 2019.<ref name="Complex Seize">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2020/04/the-game-royalties-record-label-seized-seven-million-accuser|title=The Game's 'Born to Rap' Royalties and Record Label Seized to Pay $7 Million to Accuser|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|last=Espinoza|first=Joshua|date=April 19, 2020|access-date=April 22, 2020|archive-date=April 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200423054219/https://www.complex.com/music/2020/04/the-game-royalties-record-label-seized-seven-million-accuser|url-status=live}}</ref> In November 2019, the Game had addressed his legal battle with Rainey during an appearance on&nbsp;''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''{{'}}s ''Everyday Struggle'',&nbsp;calling Rainey a liar, and&nbsp;insisted he was never&nbsp;going to pay her.<ref name="Complex Seize" />

===2017 battery misdemeanor===
In 2017, Game pleaded no contest to assaulting an off-duty police officer on March 29, 2015, during a basketball game at a Hollywood high school. Game, then 37, entered a no contest plea to one misdemeanor count each of criminal threats and battery, and also pleaded no contest to one felony count of grand theft, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. He was immediately sentenced to three years of formal probation, 120 hours of community service and 26 anger management counseling sessions, and a 6-month suspended sentence.

Game and an off-duty Los Angeles police officer were on opposing teams in a basketball game when the defendant intentionally fouled, then sucker-punched the victim who had just stolen the ball from the defendant and scored a basket. Game threatened to kill the victim once the defendant was ejected as a result of the punch, and on April 11, 2015, Game grabbed and threatened a man filming him being served with legal papers outside of his house and kept the victim's camera, according to the prosecutor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/02/06/rapper-the-game-sentenced-for-punching-los-angeles-policeman/97574120/ |title=Rapper The Game sentenced for punching policeman |date=February 9, 2017 |newspaper=USA Today |access-date=February 2, 2017 |archive-date=February 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209014837/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/02/06/rapper-the-game-sentenced-for-punching-los-angeles-policeman/97574120/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

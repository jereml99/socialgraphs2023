In January 1991 Shakur debuted under the stage name 2Pac on [[Digital Underground]], under a new record label, [[Interscope Records]], on the group's January 1991 single "[[Same Song (Digital Underground song)|Same Song]]". The song was featured on the soundtrack of the 1991 film ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'', starring [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[John Candy]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Demi Moore]].<ref name="Brown-2016" /> The song opened the group's January 1991 EP titled ''[[This Is an EP Release]]'',<ref name="Brown-2016" /> while Shakur appeared in the music video.

At the request of Steinberg, Digital Underground co-founder Jimi "Chopmaster J" Dright worked with Shakur, [[Ray Luv]] and Dize, a DJ, on their earliest studio recordings. Dright recalls that Shakur did not work well as part of a group, and added, "this guy was on a mission. From day one.

=== Posthumous rumored roles and ''Star Wars'' ===

It was rumored that Shakur was being considered by [[George Lucas]] to portray [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' prequel films (1999–2005). According to former [[Death Row Records]] chief engineer Rick Clifford, George Lucas was eyeing Tupac to star in his return to the "Star Wars" saga. Clifford talked about how understandably excited Tupac was for the role, "'Pac found out that I worked for Brian Austin Green, who was on ''90210'', then he found out I [worked on] some movies, so we always talked about his film career and stuff. [...] He was telling me that he was supposed to read for George Lucas and them. They wanted him to be a Jedi. I'm serious. Samuel L. [Jackson] got Tupac's part. [Tupac] said [to me], 'Old man, keep your fingers crossed.' He said, 'I've got three movies coming up. One of them, I've got to read for George Lucas."<ref name="jedi" >{{cite magazine |last1=Grow |first1=Kory |title=Tupac Shakur Auditioned to Be a Jedi in 'Star Wars': Report |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tupac-shakur-auditioned-to-be-a-jedi-in-star-wars-report-245892/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |publisher=rollingstone.com |access-date=June 11, 2023}}</ref>

[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]] script had begun being written in 1996 and the eventual film seeing release in 1999. Lucas had asked Jackson to ask Shakur to audition but due to Shakur's untimely death the role ultimately went to [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. The two had worked on the film ''[[Juice (1992 film)|Juice]]'' together. The character's bald appearance could have also been an homage to Shakur.<ref name="jedi" />

On August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed outdoors at a festival. For about an hour after the performance, he signed autographs and posed for photos. A conflict broke out and Shakur allegedly drew a legally carried [[Colt Mustang]] but dropped it on the ground. Shakur claimed that someone with him then picked it up when it accidentally discharged.<ref name="marin">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marin-slaying-case-against-rapper-opens-3122665.php|title=Marin slaying case against rapper opens |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 3, 1995 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412011323/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marin-slaying-case-against-rapper-opens-3122665.php |archive-date=April 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name="settlement">{{cite web|title=Settlement in Rapper's Trial for Boy's Death |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 8, 1995 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PAGE-ONE-Settlement-in-Rapper-s-Trial-For-3019996.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513061224/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PAGE-ONE-Settlement-in-Rapper-s-Trial-For-3019996.php |archive-date=May 13, 2013}}</ref>

About 100 yards (90 meters) away in a schoolyard, Qa'id Walker-Teal, a boy aged 6 on his bicycle, was fatally shot in the forehead. Police matched the bullet to a [[.38 caliber|.38-caliber]] pistol registered to Shakur. His stepbrother Maurice Harding was arrested in suspicion of having fired the gun, but no charges were filed. Lack of witnesses stymied prosecution. In 1995, Qa'id's mother filed a [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death suit]] against Shakur, which was settled for about $300,000 to $500,000.<ref name="marin" /><ref name="settlement" />

==== C. Delores Tucker lawsuit ====

== Artistry ==
Shakur's music and philosophical outlook were deeply influenced by a wide range of American, [[African-American culture|African-American]], and global influences, including the [[Black Panther Party]], [[black nationalism]], [[egalitarianism]], and the concept of [[liberty]]. Moreover, Shakur's artistic sensibilities were enriched by his passion for theater and admiration for the works of [[William Shakespeare]]. Notably, he honed his theatrical skills as a student at the [[Baltimore School for the Arts]], where he delved into the psychological complexities inherent in inter-gang warfare and inter-cultural conflicts, reflecting themes explored in Shakespearean dramas.<ref name=":1" />

''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'' (1991), showcased his socially conscious perspective. Through powerful tracks like "[[Brenda's Got a Baby]]", "[[Trapped (Tupac Shakur song)|Trapped]]", and "Part Time Mutha", Shakur addressed social injustice, poverty, and police brutality. In doing so, he contributed to the ongoing success of rap groups such as [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Public Enemy]], [[X Clan|X-Clan]], and [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]], while establishing himself as one of the pioneering socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.<ref name=":2" />

Continuing his focus on the social challenges faced by African-American people, Shakur's second album featured songs like "The Streetz R Deathrow" and "Last Wordz". Simultaneously, he showcased his compassionate side with the empowering anthem "[[Keep Ya Head Up]]", and his legendary intensity with the title track from the album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...]]'' Additionally, he paid homage to his former group [[Digital Underground]] by including them on the playful track "[[I Get Around (Tupac Shakur song)|I Get Around]]". Throughout his career, Shakur's subsequent albums reflected a growing assertiveness in his approach.<ref name=":3" />

Shakur's body of work encompassed contrasting themes, including [[social inequality]], [[injustice]], compassion, playfulness, and [[hope]]. These elements continued to shape his artistry, exemplified by his explosive 1995 album ''[[Me Against the World]]''.<ref name=":5" /> The release of ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' in 1996 further solidified his reputation, with tracks like "Ambitionz Az a Ridah", "[[I Ain't Mad at Cha]]", "[[California Love]]", "Life Goes On", and "Picture Me Rollin'" being hailed as classics by critics. Shakur described ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' as a celebration of life, and the album achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success.<ref name=":4" />

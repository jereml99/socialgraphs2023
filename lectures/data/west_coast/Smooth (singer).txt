'''Juanita Stokes''' (born 1972), currently known as '''Needa S.''' (formerly '''Smooth'''), is an American singer and rapper.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5A0EAAAAMBAJ&q=Smooth++rap+Strawberries+billboard&pg=PA104|title=A&M reinforces R&B efforts in deal with Shaquille O'Neal Label|date=February 14, 1998|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=104|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> She is the daughter of actress Irene Stokes and younger sister of music executive [[Chris Stokes (record producer)|Chris Stokes]].

== Career ==
Stokes began her career as MC Smooth, signing a record deal with the independent label Crush Music in 1990. She released her debut single "Smooth & Legit" that year, which peaked at #11 on the U.S. Rap chart. Her debut album ''[[Smooth & Legit]]'' followed on April 27, 1990 (peaking at #72 on the R&B/Hip Hop chart) and was produced by her brother Chris Stokes and [[Arabian Prince]]. Two singles "You Gotta Be Real" and "Where is the Money?" followed but did not garner much airplay. Three years later, she signed a major label deal with [[Jive Records]] and began work on her sophomore album, dropping the MC from her moniker. Her first single under the new deal, "Female Mac" garnered some airplay, and it was soon followed by the release of her second album ''[[You Been Played]]'' on August 24, 1993, which peaked at #77 on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The title track was released as the set's follow-up single. Soon after, she began work on her third studio album, releasing the first single "[[Mind Blowin' (Smooth song)|Mind Blowin']]" in 1995. The single began her breakthrough hit, hitting #7 on the Rap chart, #31 on R&B, and #75 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] (her first entry on that chart). Her [[Smooth (album)|self-titled]] third album was released on August 1, 1995, peaking at #35 on the R&B/Hip Hop albums chart and #17 on the Heatseekers chart. Four more singles would be released from the project: "Blowin' Up My Pager" "It's Summertime" "Love Groove" and "Undercover Lover" of which the latter three garnered her success in the UK.

Later that year, she collaborated with the R&B group [[IMx|Immature]] on their single "We Got It" which was released as a single in 1996 and became a hit, peaking at #37 on the Hot 100 and #11 on the R&B chart. She would later collaborate with them again on the song "Watch Me Do My Thing". She released a stand-alone single, "Love & Happiness" which had some airplay on the R&B stations.

In 1997, Smooth moved to [[Perspective Records]], a joint venture with [[A&M Records]] and reintroduced herself as a R&B singer with alternative influences. She released her first single under the label, "[[Strawberries (song)|Strawberries]]" that year, which became her biggest hit to date, peaking at #17 on R&B and #49 on the Hot 100. Her fourth album, ''[[Reality (Smooth album)|Reality]]'' was released on March 10, 1998. It would peak at #48 on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart and #32 on the Heatseekers. One more single, "He Thinks She Don't Know" was released.

In 2003, she rebranded herself once again, under the Needa S moniker. Two singles "Sensitive" and "Baby's Mama" were released, but her fifth studio album ''What?'' was eventually shelved.

In 2013, it was announced she has joined the upcoming [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] reality series ''Hip Hop Sisters'' which will focus on six female rappers' lives and their attempts to relaunch their careers. Other rappers confirmed to appear are [[MC Lyte]], [[Lady of Rage]], [[Monie Love]], [[Lil Mama]], and [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vibevixen.com/2013/06/bet-hip-hop-sisters-show/ |title=@VIBEVixen» BET Announces 'Hip Hop Sisters' and Jeanette Jenkins Reality Series » Madison Lafayette |publisher=Vibevixen.com |date= |access-date=August 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812211027/http://www.vibevixen.com/2013/06/bet-hip-hop-sisters-show/ |archive-date=August 12, 2014 }}</ref>

==Music career==
===Early work===
In 1986, at the age of 16, Ice Cube began rapping in the trio [[C.I.A. (band)|C.I.A.]] but soon joined the newly formed rap group [[N.W.A]]. He was N.W.A's lead rapper and main ghostwriter on its official debut album, 1988's ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]''. Due to a financial dispute, he left the group by the start of 1990. During 1990, his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', found him also leading a featured rap group, [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref name="chillin"/> Meanwhile, he helped develop the rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo Yo]].<ref name=":3" /><ref>Simon Glickman, [https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/yo-yo "Yo Yo"], Contemporary Musicians, ''[[Encyclopedia.com]]'', [[Cengage]], updated May 5, 2020.</ref>

===1986: C.I.A.===
With friend [[Sir Jinx]], Ice Cube formed the rap group [[C.I.A. (group)|C.I.A.]], and performed at parties hosted by [[Dr. Dre]]. Since 1984, Dre was a member of a popular DJ crew, the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]], which by 1985 was also performing and recording electro rap. Dre had Cube help write the Wreckin Cru's hit song "Cabbage Patch". Dre also joined Cube on a side project, a duo called Stereo Crew, which made a 12-inch record, "She's a Skag", released on [[Epic Records]] in 1986.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Johson|first=Bill|date=May 31, 2010|title=Ice Cube Reminisces On His Very First Gig And Single|work=The Urban Daily|url=http://theurbandaily.com/music/first-things-first-music/billjohnson/ice-cube-reminisces-on-his-very-first-gig-and-single/|access-date=February 21, 2011}}</ref>

In 1987, C.I.A. released the [[Dr. Dre]]-produced single "[[My Posse]]". Meanwhile, the Wreckin' Cru's home base was the Eve After Dark nightclub, about a quarter of a mile outside of the city of Compton in Los Angeles county. While Dre was on the turntable, Ice Cube would rap, often parodying other artists' songs. In one instance, Cube's rendition was "My Penis", parodying Run-DMC's "[[My Adidas]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Jake|title=Dr. Dre in the Studio: From Compton, Death Row, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, the Game, and Mad Money: the Life, Times, and Aftermath of the Notorious Record Producer, Dr. Dre|date=2006|publisher=Amber Books Publishing|isbn=9780976773559|location=London|page=6}}</ref> In 2015, the nightclub's co-owner and Wreckin' leader [[Alonzo Williams]] would recall feeling his reputation damaged by this and asking it not to be repeated.<ref name="Lonzo">[http://allhiphop.com/2015/08/24/world-class-wreckin-crus-lonzo-williams-dr-dre-gay-rumors-straight-outta-compton/ World Class Wreckin' Cru Founder Alonzo Williams Addresses Dr. Dre Gay Rumors & 'Straight Outta Compton'], Allhiphop.com, August 24, 2015</ref>

===1986–1989: N.W.A.===

At 16, Cube sold his first song to Eric Wright, soon dubbed [[Eazy-E]], who was forming [[Ruthless Records]] and the musical team [[N.W.A]], based in [[Compton, California]].<ref name="Jessie Carney Smith 2006" /> Himself from [[South Los Angeles|South Central Los Angeles]], Cube would be N.W.A's only core member not born in Compton.

Upon the success of the song "[[Boyz-n-the-Hood]]"—written by Cube, produced by Dre, and rapped by Eazy-E, helping establish gangsta rap in California—Eazy focused on developing N.W.A,<ref>Loren Kajikawa, ''Sounding Race in Rap Songs'' (Oakland: [[University of California Press]], 2015), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-x9BgAAQBAJ&dq=Boyz+Straight&pg=PA93 p 93].</ref> which soon gained [[MC Ren]]. Cube wrote some of Dre's and nearly all of Eazy's lyrics on N.W.A's official debut album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in August 1988.<ref name=":2" /> Yet by late 1989, Cube questioned his compensation and N.W.A's management by [[Jerry Heller]].<ref name="Ice Cube 2002">''Ice Cube: Attitude'' (McIver, 2002) {{ISBN|1-86074-428-1}}</ref>

Cube also wrote most of Eazy-E's debut album ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]''. He received a total pay of $32,000, and the contract that Heller presented in 1989 did not confirm that he was officially an N.W.A member.<ref name="Attitude70">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref> After leaving the group and its label in December, Cube sued Heller, and the lawsuit was later settled out of court.<ref name="Attitude70"/> In response, N.W.A members attacked Cube on the 1990 EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on N.W.A's next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]'', in 1991.<ref name=":122"/>

===1989–1993: Early solo career, ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', ''Death Certificate'', and ''The Predator''===
In early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with iconic rap group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team, [[the Bomb Squad]]. Arriving in May 1990, it was an instant hit, further swelling rap's mainstream integration. Controversial nonetheless, it drew accusations of misogyny and racism. The album introduces Ice Cube's affirmation of black nationalism and ideology of black struggle.

Cube appointed [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]], a female rapper and guest on the album, to be the head of his record label, and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. Also in 1990, Cube followed up with an [[Extended Play|EP]]—''[[Kill At Will]]''—critically acclaimed, and rap's first EP certified [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|title=Ice Cube – Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p48/biography|pure_url=yes}}|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|year=2007|website=Allmusic|access-date=February 13, 2008}}</ref>

His second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=David|date=October 31, 1991|title=Death Certificate – Ice Cube|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/death-certificate-r27942/review|access-date=April 11, 2012|website=AllMusic}}</ref> The album thought to as more focused, yet even more controversial, triggering accusations of anti-white, antisemitic, and misogynist content. The album was split into two themes: the Death Side, "a vision of where we are today", and the Life Side, "a vision of where we need to go". The track "[[No Vaseline]]" scathingly retorts insults directed at him by N.W.A's [[100 Miles and Runnin'|1990 EP]] and [[EFil4zaggin|1991 album]], which call him a traitor.<ref name=":122">Sacha Jenkins, Elliott Wilson, Jeff Mao, Gabe Alvarez & Brent Rollins, "Mo' beef, mo' problems: #7, N.W.A vs. Ice Cube", ''[[Ego Trip (magazine)|Ego Trip]]'s Book of Rap Lists'' (New York: [[St. Martin's Griffin]], 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sB3SAgAAQBAJ&dq=%22100+Miles%22&pg=PA238 p 238].</ref><ref>Vlad Lyubovny, interviewer, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdO7SJ5VGoQ "DJ Yella: All of NWA knew Ice Cube won with 'No Vaseline' "], ''VladTV''–''[[DJ Vlad|DJVlad]]'' @ YouTube "Verified" channel, August 22, 2015.</ref> Besides calling for hanging Eazy-E as a "house nigga", the track blames N.W.A's manager [[Jerry Heller]] for exploiting the group, mentions that he is a Jew, and calls for his murder.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":7" /> Ice Cube contended that he mentioned Heller's ethnicity merely incidentally, not to premise attack, but as news media mention nonwhite assailants' races.<ref name=":7" /> The track "Black Korea", also deemed racist,<ref name=":6" /> was also thought as foreseeing the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].<ref name="Allmusic"/> While controversial, ''Death Certificate'' broadened his audience; he toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992.<ref name=chillin/>

[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|left|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska]]
Cube's third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', was released in November 1992. Referring to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], the song "[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]" opens, "April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel." ''The Predator'' was the first album ever to debut at No. 1 on both the R&B/hip-hop and pop charts. Singles include "[[It Was a Good Day]]" and "[[Check Yo Self]]", songs having a "two-part" music video. Generally drawing critical praise, the album is his most successful commercially, over three million copies sold in the US. After this album, Cube's rap audience severely diminished, and never regained the prominence of his first three albums.<ref name=":5" />

During this time, Cube began to have numerous features on other artists' songs. In 1992, Cube appeared on [[Del the Funky Homosapien]]'s debut album ''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]'', on [[Da Lench Mob]]'s debut ''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', which he also produced, and on the [[Kool G Rap]] and [[DJ Polo]] song "[[Live and Let Die (album)|Two to the Head]]". In 1993, he worked on [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]]'s debut album, and collaborated with [[Ice-T]] on the track "Last Wordz" on [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]]'s album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]]''.

===1993–1998: ''Lethal Injection'' and forming Westside Connection===
Cube's fourth album, ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', came out in late 1993. Here, Cube borrowed from the then-popular [[G-funk]] popularized by [[Dr. Dre]]. Although not received well by critics, the album brought successful singles, including "[[Really Doe (Ice Cube song)|Really Doe]]", "[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]", "[[You Know How We Do It]]", and "What Can I Do?" After this album, Ice Cube effectively lost his rap audience.<ref name=":5" />

Following ''Lethal Injection'', Cube focused on films and producing albums of other rappers, including Da Lench Mob, [[Mack 10]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], and [[Kausion]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name="Allmusic" /> In 1994, Cube teamed with onetime N.W.A groupmate [[Dr. Dre]], who was then leading rap's [[G-funk]] subgenre, for the first time since Cube had left the group, and which had disbanded upon Dre's 1991 departure. The result was the Cube and Dre song "[[Natural Born Killaz]]", on the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, released by Dre's then-new label, [[Death Row Records]].

In 1995, Cube joined Mack 10 and [[WC (rapper)|WC]] in forming a side trio, the [[Westside Connection]]. Feeling neglected by East Coast media, a [[East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry|longstanding issue in rap's bicoastal rivalry]], the group aimed to reinforce West pride and resonate with the undervalued. The Westside Connection's first album, ''[[Bow Down]]'' (1996), featured tracks like "Bow Down" and "Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round" that reflected the group's objectives. The album was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by year's end. Interpreting rapper [[Common (rapper)|Common]]'s song "[[I Used to Love H.E.R.]]" as a diss of West Coast rap, Cube and the Westside Connection briefly feuded with him, but they resolved amicably in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 3, 2020|title=Ice Cube says beef with Common was a 'dark moment' in his career|url=https://www.bet.com/music/2020/02/03/ice-cube-says-beef-with-common-was-one-of-the-low-points-in-his-.html|access-date=June 11, 2020|publisher=[[BET]]}}</ref>

It was also at this time that Cube began collaborating outside the rap genre. In 1997, he worked with [[David Bowie]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]] singer [[Trent Reznor]] on a remix of Bowie's "[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]". In 1998, Cube was featured on the band [[Korn]]'s song "[[Children of the Korn]]", and joined them on their [[Family Values Tour 1998]].

===1998–2006: ''War & Peace Vol. 1 & 2'' and Westside Connection reunion===
In November 1998, Cube released his long-awaited fifth solo album ''[[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)]]''. The delayed sixth album, ''[[War & Peace - Volume 2 (The Peace Disc)|Volume 2]]'', arrived in 2000. These albums feature the [[Westside Connection]] and a reunion with his old N.W.A members Dr. Dre and MC Ren. Cube also received a return favor from Korn, as they appeared on his song "Fuck Dying" from ''Vol. 1''. Many fans maintained that these two albums, especially the second, were lesser in quality to his earlier work.<ref>{{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title="War & Peace, Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)" – Overview|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r465652|pure_url=yes}}|website=Allmusic|access-date=February 13, 2008}}</ref> In 2000, Cube also joined Dr. Dre, [[Eminem]], and [[Snoop Dogg]] for the [[Up in Smoke Tour]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=Four Hours of Swagger from Dr. Dre and Friends|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2DE123BF934A25754C0A9669C8B63|work=The New York Times |date=July 17, 2000|access-date=February 13, 2008}}</ref>

In 2002, Cube appeared on British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track "Get Em Up".

Released in 2003, Westside Connection's second album, ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'', fared well critically, but saw lesser sales. "Gangsta Nation" (featuring [[Nate Dogg]]), the only single released, was a radio hit. After a rift between Cube and Mack 10 about Cube's film work minimizing the group's touring, the Westside Connection disbanded in 2005.

In 2004, Cube featured on the song "[[Real Nigga Roll Call]]" by [[Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz]], the then leaders of rap's [[crunk]] subgenre.

===2006–2012: ''Laugh Now, Cry Later'', ''Raw Footage'', and ''I Am the West''===
In 2006, Cube released his seventh solo album, ''[[Laugh Now, Cry Later]]'', selling 144,000 units in the first week.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ice Cube – Billboard Albums|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p48/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}|website=Allmusic|year=2007|access-date=February 13, 2008}}</ref> [[Lil Jon]] and [[Scott Storch]] produced the lead single, "[[Why We Thugs]]". In October, Ice Cube was honored at VH1's Annual Hip Hop Honors, and performed it and also the track "Go to Church". Cube soon toured globally in the Straight Outta Compton Tour—accompanied by rapper WC from the Westside Connection—playing in America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.

Amid Cube's many features and brief collaborations, September 2007 brought ''[[In the Movies]]'', a compilation album of Ice Cube songs on soundtracks.<ref>Jeffries, David. [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1188999|pure_url=yes}} "In the Movies" – Overview]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved September 7, 2007.</ref>

Cube's eighth studio album, ''[[Raw Footage]]'', arrived on August 19, 2008, yielding the singles "[[Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It]]" and "[[Do Ya Thang (Ice Cube song)|Do Ya Thang]]". Also in 2008, Cube helped on [[Tech N9ne]]'s song "[[Killer (Tech N9ne album)|Blackboy]]", and was featured on [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]]'s song "[[LAX (album)|State of Emergency]]".

As a fan of the [[NFL]] football team the Raiders, Cube released in October 2009 a tribute song, "Raider Nation".<ref>{{cite web|title=Raider Nation!|url=http://icecube.com/news/5743/|publisher=Ice Cube|access-date=June 1, 2010}}</ref> In 2009, Ice Cube performed at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]], and returned to perform at the 2011 festival.<ref>{{youTube|5gKE67L97SA|2011 Gathering Of The Juggalos Infomercial}}</ref>

[[File:Ice cube c.jpg|thumb|right|Ice Cube performing at Metro City Concert Club in October 2010]]
On September 28, 2010, his ninth solo album, ''[[I Am the West]]'', arrived with, Cube says, a direction different from any one of his other albums. Its producers include West Coast veterans like [[DJ Quik]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[E-A-Ski]], and, after nearly 20 years, again Cube's onetime C.I.A groupmate [[Sir Jinx]]. Offering the single "I Rep That West", the album debuted at #22 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 22,000 copies in its first week. Also in 2010, Cube signed up-and-coming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, deemed likely to be either skipped or given the cookie-cutter treatment by most record companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ice Cube Blogs About "I Am The West", Mack 10 &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10858/title.ice-cube-blogs-about-i-am-the-west-mack-10|last=Jacobs|first=Allen|date=March 19, 2010|publisher=HipHop DX|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926011839/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10858/title.ice-cube-blogs-about-i-am-the-west-mack-10|archive-date=September 26, 2012|access-date=February 23, 2012}}</ref>

=== Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and allegations of Anti-semitism ===
At a 1991 press conference promoting his album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'', Cube endorsed the Nation of Islam's [[Pseudo-scholarship|pseudo-scholarly]] book ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'', which falsely claims that European Jews dominated the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last=Woldu |first=Gail Hilson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrUYZm3xZQgC |title=The Words and Music of Ice Cube |date=2008-10-30 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-08078-4 |pages=37 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Adler |first=Bill |date=2020 |title=An Open Letter to Ari Melber About Ice Cube |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/bill-adler-ice-cube-ari-melber |access-date=16 April 2023 |website=Tablet Magazine}}</ref> ''Death Certificate'' also contains the song "[[No Vaseline]]",<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":0" /> which uses racial slurs against the other former members of N.W.A and refers to the group's manager [[Jerry Heller]] as "white man", "white boy", "Jew", "devil", "white Jew", and "[[cracker (slur)|cracker]]".<ref name=":10">{{cite book|first=Soren|last=Baker|title=The History of Gangster Rap: From Schoolly D to Kendrick Lamar, the Rise of a Great American Art Form|publisher=[[Abrams Image]]|location=New York City|date=2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIFnDwAAQBAJ&q=Vaseline+Eazy+house+nigga+Heller+Jew|quote=...'No Vaseline', specifically its treatment of its two main targets, N.W.A's leader Eazy-E and N.W.A's manager Jerry Heller, whom Ice Cube depicts as teaming to financially molest N.W.A's other members.|isbn=9781683352358}}</ref><ref>[https://www.metrolyrics.com/no-vaseline-lyrics-ice-cube.html "Ice Cube—'No Vaseline' lyrics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801192648/https://www.metrolyrics.com/no-vaseline-lyrics-ice-cube.html |date=August 1, 2020 }}, ''[[MetroLyrics.com]]'', CBS Interactive Inc., 2020.</ref>  In response to accusations of racism and [[anti-Semitism]], Cube said in 2008, "I ain't got time to be fuckin' anti-Semitic, anti-this, anti-that, [[Anti-Korean sentiment|anti-Korean]]. I ain't got time for that shit. I'm too busy bein' pro-black, you know what I'm saying?"<ref name=":12" />

In 2015, Cube expressed regret at including the word "Jew" in the lyrics of "No Vaseline" and explained that he intended to attack only Heller and not "the whole Jewish race".<ref name=":10" /> However, that same year, he was sued for allegedly ordering the assault of a [[rabbi]].<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":0">JTA, [https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/rapper-ice-cube-scuffles-with-rabbi-outside-casino-hit-with-2ml-law-suit-404511 "Rapper Ice Cube scuffles with rabbi outside casino, hit with $2ml lawsuit"], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', JPost.com, Jpost Inc., May 30, 2015.</ref> During the assault, which he denied instigating, he reportedly uttered anti-Semitic slurs against the rabbi for wearing a [[yarmulke]].<ref name=":0"/>

In 2020, Marlow Stern wrote an article in the ''[[Daily Beast]]'' addressing Cube's "long, disturbing history" of anti-Semitism.<ref name=":7">{{cite web|first=Marlow|last=Stern|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/ice-cubes-long-disturbing-history-of-anti-semitism|title=Ice Cube's long, disturbing history of anti-Semitism|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=June 11, 2020}}</ref> The article was a response to Cube's day-long Twitter posting spree the day before,<ref name=":13">{{cite web|first=Joseph A.|last=Wulfsohn|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ice-cube-accused-anti-semitic-images-twitter|title=Ice Cube accused of sharing anti-Semitic images on Twitter|website=[[Fox News]]|date=June 11, 2020}}</ref> during which he promoted Nation of Islam leader [[Louis Farrakhan]]<ref name=":9" /> and posted an image of the allegedly anti-Semitic mural ''[[Freedom for Humanity]]'' with the caption "Fuck the new normal until they fix the old normal!"<ref>Jpost staff, "[[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] slams Ice Cube's antisemitic tweets", ''[[Jerusalem Post|JerusalemPost.com]]'', Jpost Inc., June 11, 2020, [https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/simon-wiesenthal-center-slams-ice-cubes-antisemitic-tweets-631195 reports], in part, "The original 2012 mural titled ''[[Freedom for Humanity]]'' was created by [[Kalen Ockerman]], better known as Mear One, and depicts [[Lord Rothschild]] and [[Paul Warburg]] sitting with other well-known people, such as English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], as they profit from the misery of others.

He ventured into a career of music in 2011 when he auditioned for ''[[The Glee Project]]''. A year later, he signed with record label Kiva House Lambroza and released an [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''Lazy Fair.'' Two years later, ''Night Circus'', another EP, was released. His debut album, ''Carnival'', was released on July 26, 2019, featuring the tracks "[[Drew Barrymore (Bryce Vine song)|Drew Barrymore]]" and "[[La La Land (Bryce Vine song)|La La Land]]", his first two songs to chart on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

== Early life ==
Bryce Ross-Johnson was born on June 16, 1988, in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to [[Tracey Ross]] and Brad Johnson. When Ross-Johnson was one, his mother moved them both to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], so she could pursue a career as an actress. Eleven years later, she got a part on the hit soap opera ''[[Passions]],'' which allowed Ross-Johnson to spend the majority of his youth in [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]]. When his father introduced him to '90s [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], he convinced his mother to buy him a [[guitar]] at the age of 13. He taught himself how to play the guitar.<ref name=LAWeekly/><ref name=MTV>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/bryce-vine/biography/|title=Bryce Vine Bio {{!}} Bryce Vine Career|website=[[MTV#Internet|MTV]]|accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>

== Career ==
A friend of Ross-Johnson's mother suggested that he send an audition tape to the [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] series, ''[[The Glee Project]]'', a reality series that served as an audition for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] show, ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. He became one of the twelve finalists, but was the first contestant to be eliminated from the show. He later stated that he was thankful, saying it "was not the right place for me."<ref name="LAWeekly" />

After ''The Glee Project'', Ross-Johnson left [[Berklee College of Music]]. It was at Berklee that he adopted his stage name, choosing Vine because it was short for vinyl.<ref name=":0" /> After meeting his now producer, [[Sir Nolan|Nolan Lambroza]], Ross-Johnson signed to Lambroza's label Kiva House Lambroza. On April 22, 2014, Ross-Johnson released his debut [[extended play|EP]], ''Lazy Fair'' (a play on the French phrase "laissez-faire," this also being the name of a boat owned by his parents) which spawned two minor online hits, "Sour Patch Kids" and "Guilty Pleasure."

Another EP, ''Night Circus'', was released on March 21, 2016, and in 2017, Ross-Johnson released the single, "[[Drew Barrymore (Bryce Vine song)|Drew Barrymore]]." The song peaked at 46 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2018-09-08|title=The Hot 100 Chart|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2 January 2013}}</ref> He released his debut album, ''Carnival,'' on July 26, 2019.<ref name="Carnival">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8514740/bryce-vine-carnival-release-date|title=Bryce Vine Announces Debut Album 'Carnival' Release Date|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Aniftos|first=Rania|date=June 5, 2019|accessdate=June 11, 2019}}</ref> "[[La La Land (Bryce Vine song)|La La Land]]," the second single from the album, peaked at 75 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/yg/chart-history/hsi/|title = YG|magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

== Artistry ==
Ross-Johnson is heavily influenced by [[Third Eye Blind]], saying that they write the type of music he aspires to write - "intelligent and honest lyrics with an infectious chorus."<ref name=LAWeekly/> Another heavy influence is rapper [[J. Cole]]. He says that he '"likes the storyteller aspect of him, as well as having a loud and clear message for listeners. Yet, he never takes himself too seriously."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/bryce-vine-tackles-serious-issues-comedic-spin-new-video-thug-song-2004121|title=Bryce Vine Tackles Serious Issues With A Comedic Spin In New Video For 'The Thug Song'|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=14 July 2015|author=Caitlyn Hitt|accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
In 2019, Seales was involved in a controversy where many people mistakenly reported that she had accused former NFL player and neurosurgeon resident [[Myron Rolle]] of sexually harassing several women.

In the weeks preceding [[Rodney Reed]]'s November 20, 2019, execution date, Seales publicly urged Texas Governor [[Greg Abbott]] to exonerate Reed or stay his execution.

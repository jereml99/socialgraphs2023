==Early life==

JHawk grew up in a cultured park of Los Angeles, [[Leimert Park]]. Both mother and father being musicians, mother being a local vocalist and father being a multi-instrumentalist. He is also the great nephew to [[The Chambers Brothers]], (Time Has Come Today),<ref>[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=9519 ''SongFacts'', Time has Come Today, January 12, 1969]</ref> often observing the band rehearse and play live shows for their great-grandmother. Shortly after receiving his first [[music sequencer]] software Hip Hop [[EJay]] from his father, he started making beats at the age of 11 and desired to become a [[music producer]]. Stating to Killerhiphophop's Quez, "I put out my 1st song on the internet when I was about 15-16, and I've just been going hard ever since".<ref>[http://www.killerhiphop.com/killerhiphop-exclusive-jhawk-interview/ ''Killerhiphop Jhawk Interview'', May 21, 2012]</ref>

==Music career==

===2008–present===

After 3 years and a junior at [[Daniel Murphy High School]], the [[Archdiocese]] decided to shut the school's doors. Jeremy, who'd been building a name for himself on campus by recording students in his bedroom studio at his grandmother's was forced to relocate senior year. Stating to KHH, " I went to a private school called Daniel Murphy. It got shut down actually. I had to complete my last year of High School at a new High School".<ref>[http://www.killerhiphop.com/killerhiphop-exclusive-jhawk-interview/ ''KHH Jhawk Interview'', May 21, 2012]</ref> After moving out of his grandmother's house, he moved in with his father. Gutting the garage and making a studio space in the spring of 2008. Often recording his cousin [[Left Brain]], who brought [[Tyler The Creator]], [[Hodgy Beats]], [[Casey Veggies]], of the year old collective [[Odd future]]. Recording and producing for the collective, [[The Odd Future Tape]], [[The Dena Tape]].<ref>[http://oddfuturetalk.com/forums/topic/3114-hodgy-beats-discography/''Hodgy Beats The Dena Tape'', 2009]</ref>

JHawk attended The Academy of Music and Performing Arts [[Alexander Hamilton High School (Los Angeles)]] in the summer of 2008. Due to a credit issue, he was required to attend a piano lesson class for admission and freshman PE class his senior year. Subsequently, adding an [[Electronic Music]] and [[Music History]] course, soon meeting friend [[Syd Tha Kyd]] in Hamilton's Mr. Bruning [[electronic music]] class. After being at [[Alexander Hamilton High School (Los Angeles)|Hamilton]] for months and remaining unnoticed he aggressively fought to gain attention. Garnering his [[Myspace]] page he began to send out beats, connecting with [[YG (rapper)]] on MySpace, the two collaborated on songs that would combine for over 3 Million plays.<ref>[https://myspace.com/yg400 ''The official MySpace account for Y.G'', 2009]</ref>

===Jerkin'===
With a heavy influence from then [[Hyphy]] movement, ([[Keak da Sneak]], [[Turf Talk]], [[E-40]]) and newfound fame from working with YG & ''The Pu$haz'' Jeremy started to collaborate with anyone, often his fellow students on campus. Slowly building recognition, kids on campus started to dance to the music, in all styles, but most notably a new style called [[Jerkin']]. Taking notice saying, "I never sought out to make a jerk beat. I always just did me. I did JHawk. People danced to my music and I kind of developed a formula to what they were grabbing off of my beats."<ref>[http://www.killerhiphop.com/killerhiphop-exclusive-jhawk-interview/ ''KHH Interview'', May 21, 2012]</ref> Eventually dance crews such as the Rangers formed on campus and videos were made with the music to match amassing tens of millions of hits on [[Myspace]] and the newly created [[YouTube]]. At the age of 17 and having worked with almost all of La's male youth, he longed to form a group. On the bleachers in the PE class he was succumbed to is when he met 6 female freshman who all rapped. The same day they quickly formed the name of the group ''Pink Dollaz''. After 2 months the music was streamed over 5 million times across [[Myspace]] and [[YouTube]] with radio spins from ''Dj Carisma''<nowiki/>'s [[KPWR|Power 106]].<ref>[http://hiphopnews24-7.com/profiles/blogs/artist-on-the-risepink-dollaz ''ARTIST ON THE RISE......PINK DOLLAZ " FEMALE RAP GROUP FROM LOS ANGELES " WITH ALMOST 3 MILLION MYSPACE HITS!!'', August 10, 2010]</ref>   A slew of relationships such as these formed by spring 2009. Another song titled 'Tippin' today amasses 14 million plays on one [[YouTube]] video alone.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j7YZhkVxsw ''Tippin on my dick youtube 14 million'',Aug 17, 2009]</ref> [[LA Weekly]]'s Jeff Weiss stating, "The wiry J-Hawk is the nexus that binds all of these groups together. After all, he's produced their hits, and to think it might not have happened if Daniel Murphy High hadn't shuttered last year, causing the 17-year-old Hawkins to transfer to Hamilton".<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/music/were-jerkin-starring-the-new-boyz-j-hawk-and-pink-dollaz-2160955 ''Starring the new boyz, JHawk and pink dollaz LA WEEKLY'', August 5, 2009]</ref> The genre, sound and culture exploded mainstream. Accidentally, JHawk was born. After amassing press mentions from ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/fashion/22jerking.html ''Hip-Hop's New Steps, New York Times Article''NOV. 20, 2009]</ref> [[LA Times]]<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/11/image/la-ig-jerking-20100411,''Jerkin' is workin' for 'em'', April 11, 2010]</ref> [[LA Weekly]]<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/music/jerkin-at-avalon-hollywood-a-dance-primer-on-a-budding-craze-2406234, ''jerkin-at-avalon-hollywood-a-dance-primer'', July 6, 2009]</ref> and a host of acts signed to major label deals.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/fashion/22jerking.html, ''"Jerking is very ground up," said Todd Moscowitz, the president of Asylum Records, who added the Rej3ctz, the New Boyz, the Bangz and the Cold Flamez to the label's roster this year'', NOV. 20, 2009]</ref> [[New Boyz]], [[The Rej3ctz]], ''Cold Flamez'', [[Audio Push]], ''The Bangz'', and [[YG (rapper)]]. JHawk stated, "I'm definitely fortunate for the movement and being one of the starters of it back in 2008".<ref>[http://www.killerhiphop.com/killerhiphop-exclusive-jhawk-interview/ ''KHH Interview'', May 21, 2012]</ref>

===Cat Daddy===
After a year and growing frustrated he re-connected with [[The Rej3ctz]] sharing similar emotions, "We were major contributors, but we felt we weren't getting our shine. So we wanted to start a new movement."<ref>[http://www.killerhiphop.com/killerhiphop-exclusive-jhawk-interview/ ''QuezKHH Exclusive'', May 21, 2012]</ref> In the spring of 2010 at JHawk's [[Home recording]] studio crafted, [[Cat Daddy]].

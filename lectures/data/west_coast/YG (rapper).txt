==Controversies==
YG was the subject of media attention and protests in October 2016 when it was reported that he had advocated for the targeted robbery of [[Asian Americans]] in his music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/10/15/chinese-americans-protest-yg-rap-song-glorifying-robberies-in-chinese-hoods/|title=Chinese-Americans Protest YG Rap Song Glorifying Robberies In Chinese Hoods|publisher=[[CBS Local]]|date=October 15, 2016|access-date=March 10, 2021}}</ref> YG's song "Meet the Flockers", from his 2014 debut album "My Krazy Life", was widely accused of racism against the Asian American community, especially Chinese Americans. In the song, YG raps "First, you find a house and scope it out / Find a Chinese neighborhood, cause they don't believe in bank accounts." Receiving little controversy when first released, the song drew renewed scrutiny in 2016 after an uptick in burglaries targeting Asian-Americans. YG has described "Meet the Flockers" as being representative of the culture he grew up in.<ref>{{cite news | last=Hawkins | first=Derek | title=Why some Asian Americans want to ban this rap song | newspaper=Washington Post | date=October 21, 2016 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/10/21/a-2-year-old-rap-song-has-drawn-criticism-from-asian-americans-whats-behind-the-push-to-ban-it/ | access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref>

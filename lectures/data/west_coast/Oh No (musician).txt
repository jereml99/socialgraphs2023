He grew up in a family that was predominantly focused towards music at a wide spectrum, being the younger brother of hip hop artist [[Madlib]], son of singer Otis Jackson, and nephew of jazz trumpeter [[Jon Faddis]].<ref name="stbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/ohno/|title=Oh No|publisher=[[Stones Throw Records]]|access-date=2009-06-29|archive-date=2016-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316220044/http://www.stonesthrow.com/ohno|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Wax Poetics">{{cite web|last=Ma|first=David|title=Oh No discovers foreign funk close to home|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2007/08/uncooked-symphonies|work=[[Wax Poetics]]|date=August 1, 2007|access-date=27 April 2014|archive-date=28 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428004148/http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2007/08/uncooked-symphonies|url-status=live}}</ref>

Oh No started performing with his group Kali Wild and was featured on his brother's group [[Lootpack]]'s album ''[[Soundpieces: Da Antidote]]''. Oh No was signed to Los Angeles-based [[Stones Throw Records]] who released his debut album, ''[[The Disrupt]]'', in 2004. Around this time he also performed on numerous singles by other artists, and began doing freelance production work for labelmates [[Wildchild (rapper)|Wildchild]], MED (Nickolas Rodriguez) and others. He has gone on to produce for [[Juggaknots]], [[De La Soul]], [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]] and various other artists.

In August 2006, Oh No released the album ''[[Exodus Into Unheard Rhythms]]'', exclusively sampling the music of [[Galt MacDermot]]<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r840773|pure_url=yes}}|title= Exodus into Unheard Rhythms – Oh No|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=2009-06-29}}</ref> and featuring appearances from numerous other rap artists, mostly in the Stones Throw family. The album was well received by critics and established Oh No as one of the leading underground producers in hip-hop. In 2007 he released ''[[Dr. No's Oxperiment]]'' to rave reviews. The album was entirely constructed using samples of Turkish, Lebanese, Greek and Italian music.

Oh No remains an avid gamer, even constructing an entire beat out of video game samples for the track "The Ride" off of ''[[The Disrupt]]''. In 2009, Oh No remixed several songs for the soundtrack of the U.S. limited edition version for [[Arc System Works]]' 2D fighting game ''[[BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger]]''. The same year, he released the album ''[[Dr. No's Ethiopium]]'', made entirely of samples of [[Ethiopia]]n music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2009/08/ohno-ethiopium-coming-to-stonesthrow-com|title=Oh No's Ethiopium coming exclusively to Stonesthrow.com|publisher=Stones Throw Records|date=2009-08-03|access-date=2009-08-04|archive-date=2016-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195259/http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2009/08/ohno-ethiopium-coming-to-stonesthrow-com|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2013, Oh No produced the original score for the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', in collaboration with [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], [[Tangerine Dream]] and [[Woody Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51411/the-music-of-grand-theft-auto-v-three-volume-digital-album-now-a.html |title=The Music of Grand Theft Auto V: Three Volume Digital Album Now Available on iTunes |publisher=Rockstar Games |date=2013-09-24 |access-date=2014-08-05 |archive-date=2017-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012150549/http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51411/the-music-of-grand-theft-auto-v-three-volume-digital-album-now-a.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

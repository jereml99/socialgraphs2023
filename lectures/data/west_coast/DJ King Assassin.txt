==Early life==
Venegas spent most of his early life in California traveling from San Jose, Vallejo, East Palo Alto and Sacramento, where he then relocated back to his native California lifestyle in the city of Los Angeles. As a kid, he won his school's spelling bee at Hillsdale Elementary and later went on to the district of Franklin Mckinley's spelling bee. He also learned to play drums in elementary school, and in eighth grade, how to make music. From that time, he became interested in music as well as breakdancing, in which he won trophies at local fairs and contests throughout the state of California.

Venegas' influences include long-time friend and collaborator [[2Pac]] and [[Eazy-E]], as he has grown up in [[California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopweekly.com/dj-king-assassin-presents-pac-ft-kokane-joe-young-big-hutch-law/|title=DJ King Assassin Presents 2Pac featuring Kokane |last=Young|first=Joe |date=2016-12-21 |work=Hip Hop Weekly }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highlightnation.com/news/slept-sundays-dj-king-assassin-man-behind-best-west/|title=SLEPT-ON SUNDAYS: DJ KING ASSASSIN – THE MAN BEHIND THE BEST OF THE WEST |last=Constantinou|first=Anton |date=2015-09-13 |work=HLN }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0b70DQT1HkC&q=dj+king+assassin&pg=RA2-PA28-IA3|title=Billboard Magazine: January 2011 Print Issue |last=|first= |date=2011-01-07 |work=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] }}</ref>

== Musical career ==

===1990s-2000s: Career beginnings===
Venegas moved where originally his parents are from, in Southern California, and began his career as a record disc jockey, in which he later produced for recording artists signed to Russell Simmons record label Def Jam. In the early part of his career, Venegas produced for several projects from [[Eazy-E]] at Kitchen Sync and Echo Sound studios. It was there where, Venegas, a rising producer, teamed up with Tupac Shakur in which he later established a close relationship with the West Coast rapper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisis50.com/profiles/blogs/tupacs-og-producer-dj-king |title=Meet Tupac's OG Producer: DJ King Assassin |last= |first= |date=2009-04-06 |work=ThisIs50 |access-date=2017-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923141654/http://www.thisis50.com/profiles/blogs/tupacs-og-producer-dj-king |archive-date=2016-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

While Tupac Shakur worked on "Me Against The World", Venegas began producing music with Shakur, later witnessing the creation and scratching on original version of "[[Dear Mama]]", one of Shakur's most successful hip-hop records. Venegas, thereafter, produced, mixed and mastered an inordinate number of records for hip-hop recording artists in the west coast of the US, influencing the unique funk sound established by rappers like Eazy-E and 2Pac.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2016/05/06/tupac-dear-mama-original-version-afeni-shakur-davis-tribute-listen/|title=Tupac's Original Version Of 'Dear Mama' Surfaces Days After Mother's Death |last=Brow|first=Jason |date=2016-05-06 |work=[[Hollywood Life]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://real923la.iheart.com/onair/dj-damage-56245/original-version-of-tupacs-dear-mama-14684243/ |title=DJ King Assassin - Original Version Of Tupac's 'Dear Mama' Surfaces |last= |first= |date=2016-05-08 |work=[[iHeartRadio]] |access-date=2017-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107004012/http://real923la.iheart.com/onair/dj-damage-56245/original-version-of-tupacs-dear-mama-14684243/ |archive-date=2017-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===2016—present: Original ''Dear Mama'' Recording & ''Makaveli'' Film===
In May 2016, following the passing of Afeni Shakur, Tupac Shakur's birth mother, Venegas was featured on [[TMZ]] and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine where he spoke on his affiliation and relationship with the Shakur estate and the release of the original version of Tupac Shakur's classic record "[[Dear Mama]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7357872/tupac-dear-mama-original-version-stream|title=Tupac's Original Version of 'Dear Mama' Surfaces |last=Stutz|first=Collin |date=2016-05-05 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref> In 2016, Venegas announced he will be producing and directing a film loosely based on Tupac Shakur's personal life and music career.

Selling 800,000 copies in its first week, ''Doggystyle'' was [[RIAA certification|certified]] quadruple-platinum in 1994 and featured the singles "[[What's My Name? (Snoop Doggy Dogg song)|What's My Name?]]" and "[[Gin and Juice]]". In 1994, Death Row Records released a soundtrack, by Broadus, for the short film ''[[Murder Was the Case]],'' starring Snoop. In 1996, his second album, ''[[Tha Doggfather]],'' also debuted at number one on both charts, with "[[Snoop's Upside Ya Head]]" as the lead single. The next year, the album was certified double-platinum.

After leaving Death Row Records in January 1998, Broadus signed with [[No Limit Records]], releasing three albums: ''[[Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told]]'' (1998), ''[[No Limit Top Dogg]]'' (1999), and ''[[Tha Last Meal]]'' (2000). In 2002, he signed with [[Priority Records|Priority]]/[[Capitol Records|Capitol]]/[[EMI]] Records, releasing ''[[Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss]]''.

In 2012, after a trip to [[Jamaica]], Broadus announced a conversion to [[Rastafari]] and a new alias, Snoop Lion. As Snoop Lion he released a [[reggae]] album, ''[[Reincarnated (album)|Reincarnated]],'' and a [[Reincarnated (film)|documentary film of the same name]], about his Jamaican experience, in early 2013.

Broadus would frequently rap in school. As he recalled: "When I rapped in the hallways at school I would draw such a big crowd that the principal would think there was a fight going on. It made me begin to realize that I had a gift. I could tell that my raps interested people and that made me interested in myself."<ref name=":0" />

As a teenager, Broadus frequently ran into trouble with the law. He was a member of the Rollin' 20s [[Crips]] gang in the [[Eastside, Long Beach, California|Eastside]] neighborhood of Long Beach;<ref name="Most Lovable Pimp">{{cite magazine|author=Toure|title=America's Most Lovable Pimp|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12676363/cover_story_americas_most_lovable_pimp/print| magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= December 14, 2006|url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621111652/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12676363/cover_story_americas_most_lovable_pimp/print| archive-date=June 21, 2008}}</ref> although in 1993 he denied the frequent police and media reports by saying that he never joined a gang.<ref name="NY Times 1993 Growl"/> Shortly after graduating from high school at [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]] in 1989, he was arrested for possession of [[cocaine]], and for the next three years, was frequently incarcerated, including at [[Peter J. Pitchess Detention Center|Wayside Jail]].<ref name="allmusicbio"/> With his two cousins, [[Nate Dogg]] and Lil' ½ Dead, and friend [[Warren G]], he recorded homemade tapes; the four called their group [[213 (group)|213]] after the [[area code]] of their native Long Beach at that time. One of Snoop's early solo [[freestyle rap|freestyles]] over "[[Hold On (En Vogue song)|Hold On]]" by [[En Vogue]] was on a [[mixtape]] that fortuitously wound up with [[Dr. Dre]]; the influential producer was so impressed by the sample that he called Snoop to audition in 1991 for his label [[Death Row Records]] (then known as Future Shock). Former [[N.W.A]] affiliate, American rapper Tracy Lynn Curry better known as [[The D.O.C.]], taught him to structure his lyrics and separate the themes into verses, hooks, and choruses.<ref name="Hip Hop Honours 2007">According to Snoop Dogg's memoirs, as told by himself in VH1 Hip Hop Honors 2007</ref>

==Music career==
===1992–1998: Death Row, ''Doggystyle,'' and ''Tha Doggfather''===
When he began recording, Broadus took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg. [[Dr. Dre]] began working with him, first on the theme song of the 1992 film ''[[Deep Cover]]'' and then on Dr. Dre's debut solo album ''[[The Chronic]]'' along with the other members of his former starting group, [[Tha Dogg Pound]]. This intense exposure played a considerable part in making Snoop Dogg's debut album, ''[[Doggystyle]],'' the critical and commercial success that it was.<ref name="allmusicbio"/>

[[File:Snoop dog-02.jpg|thumb|right|Snoop Dogg in 1998]]
Fueling the ascendance of [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] [[G-funk]] hip hop, the singles "[[Who Am I (What's My Name)?]]" and "[[Gin and Juice]]" reached the top ten most-played songs in the United States, and the album stayed on the Billboard charts for several months.<ref name= allmusicbio /> [[Gangsta rap]] became the center of arguments about censorship and labeling, with Snoop Dogg often used as an example of violent and [[misogynistic]] musicians.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=How Pop Music Lost the Melody|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3DD143CF930A35754C0A962958260&sec=&spon=|work=The New York Times|date=July 3, 1994|access-date=July 4, 2008|archive-date=December 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216124020/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3DD143CF930A35754C0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|url-status=live}}</ref> Unlike much of the harder-edged [[gangsta rap]] artists, Snoop Dogg seemed to show his softer side, according to music journalist [[Chuck Philips]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' music critic [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]] asserted that Snoop had a relatively soft vocal delivery compared to other rappers: "Snoop's vocal style is part of what distinguishes him: where many rappers scream, figuratively and literally, he speaks softly."<ref name="NY Times 1993 Growl"/> ''Doggystyle,'' much like ''The Chronic,'' featured a host of rappers signed to or affiliated with the Death Row label including [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Kurupt]], [[Nate Dogg]], and others.

In 1993, Broadus was charged with first-degree murder for the shooting of Philip Woldermariam, a member of a rival gang who was actually killed by Snoop's bodyguard, McKinley Lee, aka Malik.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/snoop-doggs-1993-murder-trial-to-be-adapted-into-starz-miniseries-from-50-cent/|title=Snoop Dogg's 1993 Murder Trial|date=December 13, 2021|access-date=February 12, 2022|archive-date=December 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211213231923/https://www.thewrap.com/snoop-doggs-1993-murder-trial-to-be-adapted-into-starz-miniseries-from-50-cent/|url-status=live}}</ref> Broadus was acquitted on February 20, 1996.

By the time Snoop Dogg's second album, ''[[Tha Doggfather]],'' was released in November 1996, the price of appearing to be a gang member "''living the gangsta'' ''life''" had become very evident. Among the many notable hip hop industry deaths and convictions were the death of Snoop Dogg's friend and labelmate [[Tupac Shakur]] and the [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] indictment of Death Row co-founder [[Suge Knight]].<ref name="allmusicbio"/> Dr. Dre had left Death Row earlier in 1996 because of a contract dispute, so Snoop Dogg co-produced ''Tha Doggfather'' with [[Daz Dillinger]] and [[DJ Pooh]].

This album featured a distinct change of style from ''Doggystyle,'' and the leadoff single, "[[Snoop's Upside Ya Head]]", featured a collaboration with  Charlie Wilson The album sold reasonably well but was not as successful as its predecessor. ''Tha Doggfather'' had a somewhat softer approach to the G-funk style. After Dr. Dre withdrew from Death Row Records, Snoop realized that he was subject to an ironclad time-based contract (i.e., that Death Row practically owned anything he produced for a number of years), and refused to produce anymore tracks for [[Suge Knight]] other than the insulting "Fuck Death Row" until his contract expired.<ref name="Most Lovable Pimp"/> In an interview with [[Neil Strauss]] in 1998, Snoop Dogg said that though he had been given lavish gifts by his former label, they had withheld his royalty payments.<ref>Strauss, Neil. ''Everyone Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys into Fame and Madness.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2011, p. 12-13</ref>

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that after ''Tha Doggfather,'' Snoop Dogg began "moving away from his gangsta roots toward a calmer lyrical aesthetic":<ref name="allmusicbio"/> for instance, Snoop participated in the 1997 [[Lollapalooza]] concert tour, which featured mainly alternative rock music.

While recording ''Doggystyle'' in August 1993, Broadus was arrested in connection with the death of a member of a rival gang who was allegedly shot and killed by Broadus's bodyguard; Broadus had been temporarily living in an apartment complex in the [[Palms, Los Angeles|Palms]] neighborhood in the [[Westside, Los Angeles|West Los Angeles]] region, in the intersection of Vinton Avenue and Woodbine Street{{emdash}}the location of the shooting.

In September 2006, Broadus was detained at [[John Wayne Airport]] in [[Orange County, California]], by airport security after airport screeners found a collapsible police [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]] in his carry-on bag.

On April 26, 2006, Broadus and members of his entourage were arrested after being turned away from [[British Airways]]' first class lounge at [[Heathrow Airport]] in London.

Snoop Dogg, after performing for a concert in [[Uppsala]], Sweden, on July 25, 2015, was pulled over and detained by Swedish police for allegedly using illegal drugs, violating a Swedish law enacted in 1988 which criminalized the recreational use of such substances – therefore making even being under the influence of any illegal/controlled substance a crime itself without possession. During the detention he was taken to the police station to perform a drug test and was released shortly afterwards. The rapid test was positive for traces of narcotics and he was potentially subject to fines depending on the results of more detailed analysis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20150731/snoop-doggs-initial-drug-test-positive-swedish-police |title=Snoop Dogg's initial drug test positive say police |website=TheLocal.se |date=July 31, 2015 |access-date=August 8, 2015 |archive-date=August 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803023459/http://www.thelocal.se/20150731/snoop-doggs-initial-drug-test-positive-swedish-police |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Snoop Dogg Arrested in Sweden on Drug Suspicions, Alleges Racial Profiling|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6642085/snoop-dogg-arrested-in-sweden-on-drug-suspicions-alleges-racial|date=July 26, 2015|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=May 16, 2020|archive-date=February 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227043405/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6642085/snoop-dogg-arrested-in-sweden-on-drug-suspicions-alleges-racial|url-status=live}}</ref> Although final results "strongly" indicated drug use the charges were ultimately dropped because it could not be proven that he was in Sweden when he consumed the substances.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20160108/snoop-dogg-wont-face-drug-charges-in-sweden |title=Snoop Dogg won't face drug charges in Sweden |newspaper=The Local Sweden |date=January 8, 2016 |access-date=September 15, 2020 |archive-date=October 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023063213/https://www.thelocal.se/20160108/snoop-dogg-wont-face-drug-charges-in-sweden |url-status=live }}</ref> The rapper uploaded several videos on the social networking site [[Instagram]] criticizing the police for alleged [[racial profiling]]; police spokesman Daniel Nilsson responded to the accusations, saying: "we don't work like that in Sweden."

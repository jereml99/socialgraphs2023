'''Kossisko Konan''' (1991/1992–present), known [[mononymous person|mononymously]] as '''Kossisko''' and formerly known as '''100s''', is an American singer/rapper and songwriter from [[Berkeley, California]]. In 2012, Kossisko, as rapper 100s, released his debut mixtape ''Ice Cold Perm''. He was signed to [[Fool's Gold Records]] in June 2013. Following the release of the single "Ten Freaky Hoes", it was announced that he would be releasing his second mixtape, an [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''Ivry'', which was released on March 7, 2014, via Fool's Gold. It featured a greater [[g-funk]] and [[Disco music|disco]] influence than his debut mixtape. He is also well known for his song "Life of a Mack", which appeared on the [[The Music of Grand Theft Auto V|soundtrack]] of the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''. At the start of 2015, he retired the 100s persona and now performs under the name Kossisko (which is his birth name). As Kossisko, he released his first single "[[This May Be Me (single)|This May Be Me]]" on February 17, 2015. The track was premiered by [[The Fader]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Byrd |url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/02/17/100s-reinvents-himself-as-kossisko-on-this-may-be-me |title=100s Reinvents Himself As Kossisko On "This May Be Me" |publisher=thefader.com |date=2015-02-17 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref> Later that year, Kossisko released his debut EP, ''[[Red White N Cruel]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Byrd |url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/premiere-kossisko-across-the-room |title=Drench In The Post Sex Afterglow of Kossisko's "Across The Room" |publisher=noisey.vice.com |date=2015-11-06 |accessdate=2015-12-28}}</ref> In 2016, Kossisko launched a crowdfunding campaign to help fund his work on a short horror film titled '2037.'<ref>{{cite web|title=Short Film "2037"|url=https://www.gofundme.com/2037shortfilm|website=[[GoFundMe]]|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Kossisko was born to a Jewish mother and African father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14497-brick-ell-phone/ |title=100s: "Brick $ell Phone" &#124; Tracks |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2012-10-25 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Cooper |first=Wilbert L. |url=https://www.vice.com/read/pimp-rap-has-a-new-prince-and-his-name-is-100s |title=Pimp Rap Has a New Prince and His Name Is 100s &#124; VICE United States |publisher=Vice.com |date=2012-10-19 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> He was raised in [[Berkeley, California]]. At age 16, due to disciplinary issues, he was sent by his father to a remote boarding school in [[Abidjan]], inside the [[Ivory Coast]]. Kossisko was told that the Africa trip was a vacation, but he was left at the school indefinitely. At the boarding school, he lived in a three-bedroom house with 15 people. He contracted [[malaria]] five times. At one point, Kossisko ran away from the boarding school and fled to the local American embassy. Despite his pleas, his parents refused to allow him to return to the U.S., and because he was under the age of 18, he had to remain in [[Ivory Coast]]. After his attempt at escape, he was sent to the small town of [[Bouaflé]] where he lived with his uncle. Not long after, he and his uncle's family moved to [[Yamoussoukro]]. While in [[Ivory Coast]], he learned to speak [[French language|French]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Kossisko returned to the United States in late 2010.

== Cultural influence ==
[[Marvel Comics]] honored the artistry of Kossisko as 100s by remixing the cover of ''IVRY'' as a marketing tool for the comic book studios latest project.

==Musical career==
Kossisko wrote his first song in 2008 and recorded for the first time in early 2010.<ref>{{cite web |author=Byrd |url=http://metrojolt.com/100s-interview |title=100s Interview |publisher=Metrojolt.com |date=2013-02-05 |accessdate=2014-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407175348/http://metrojolt.com/100s-interview |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}</ref> He began to take rapping seriously in 2011 at the age of 19.<ref name="uproxx1">{{cite web |author=TSSCrew |url=http://smokingsection.uproxx.com/TSS/2013/04/100s-interview |title=Fifteen Minutes With 100s &#124; The Smoking Section |publisher=Smokingsection.uproxx.com |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2014-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063754/http://smokingsection.uproxx.com/TSS/2013/04/100s-interview |archive-date=2014-04-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Following his stay in the Ivory Coast, Kossisko moved back to Berkeley where he began recording his debut mixtape as 100s titled, ''Ice Cold Perm''.<ref>{{cite web |author=TSSCrew |url=http://smokingsection.uproxx.com/TSS/2013/04/100s-ice-cold-perm |title=Ice Cold Island: Introducing 100s &#124; The Smoking Section |publisher=Smokingsection.uproxx.com |date=2013-04-03 |accessdate=2014-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063956/http://smokingsection.uproxx.com/TSS/2013/04/100s-ice-cold-perm |archive-date=2014-04-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On September 5, 2012, 100s released ''Ice Cold Perm'', which was produced largely by Joe Wax. The cover artwork was inspired by the cover of [[Snoop Dogg]]'s ''[[Tha Doggfather]]'', which he called a classic album.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> On the mixtape he also collaborated with [[Main Attrakionz]] and [[Ryan Hemsworth]].<ref name="uproxx1" /> Brandon Soderberg of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' commented on it saying, "This is snarling, no-nonsense pimp-rap, celebrating exploitation and preemptively lashing out at everyone trying to get anything over on 100s, but it finds a way to complicate those regressive, retro sensibilities".<ref>{{cite web|last=Soderberg |first=Brandon |url=http://www.spin.com/blogs/rap-release-of-the-week-100s-ice-cold-perm/ |title=Rap Release of the Week: 100s' 'Ice Cold Perm' |publisher=SPIN |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> On October 18, 2012, the Noisey subsidiary of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' premiered the music video for "Brick Sell Phone".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/ja/music-video-premieres/100s |title=100S - "BRICK $ELL PHONE" (OFFICIAL VIDEO) &#124; MUSIC VIDEO PREMIERES &#124; NOISEY |publisher=Noisey.vice.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>

In an interview with ''Vice'' later that month, Kossisko said his next project would be titled ''Sex Symbols'', which he had already started recording. He described it as different saying, "It's more influenced by R&B. I've got some singers on there. It's going to be more funky, too. What I wanted to do, as best as I could, was have a fusion between [19]90s mack-rap and late [19]80s pop and soul. Something like [[Bobby Brown]] or [[Rick James]]."<ref name="autogenerated1" /> On January 23, 2013, ''Ice Cold Perm'' was released for [[Music download|digital download]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/ice-cold-perm/id592221708 |title=iTunes - Music - Ice Cold Perm by 100s |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2013-01-29 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> In early 2013, he went on the Group Hug Tour with [[Kreayshawn]], then performed five shows at 2013's [[SXSW]].<ref name="uproxx1" />

On February 26, 2014, 100s released the song "Ten Freaky Hoes" and revealed that he would be releasing a free [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''Ivry'', replacing the previously announced ''Sex Symbols''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/new-music-100s-ten-freaky-hoes |title=New Music: 100s 'Ten Freaky Hoes' |publisher=Vibe |date=2014-02-26 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> "Ten Freaky Hoes" is a "melodic G-funk jam that adds a dose of Californian psychedelia to his formerly frozen atmospherics."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/02/27/100s-ten-freaky-hoes-fools-gold-ivry-ep/ |title=West Coast rapper 100s drops 'Ten Freaky Hoes' featuring Redinho on talkbox – FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music |publisher=Factmag.com |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> ''Ivry'' was subsequently set for a March 2014 release. "Ten Freaky Hoes", is also most notably the song that ended the existence of 100s, with a short letter from the artist placed at the end of the music video saying, "To the 100s fans, I appreciate each and everyone of you but its now time for me to count my journey.

'''Mark Julian Felder'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/mark_julian_felder_born_1983_15800805|title=Mark Julian Felder|website=www.californiabirthindex.org}}</ref> (born July 21, 1983), more commonly known as '''Bizzle''', is an American [[Christian hip hop]] recording artist and entrepreneur.

In January 2010, Bizzle released "You Got Some Explaining to Do". The song criticizes rapper [[Jay-Z]] for negative references towards Jesus and Christianity in his music. Bizzle released his first mixtape, ''The Messenger'', in March 2010. Shortly after the release, he founded God Over Money Records in Houston, Texas. Bizzle released his debut album, ''[[Tough Love & Parables]]'', on June 21, 2011. It debuted at No. 15 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Gospel Albums chart. ''[[The Good Fight (Bizzle album)|The Good Fight]]'' was released on May 7, 2013 and debuted at No.&nbsp;2 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Gospel Albums chart, No.&nbsp;7 on [[Christian Albums]], and No.&nbsp;11 on [[Top Rap Albums]]. In 2013, Bizzle won Kingdom Choice Awards for Rap Single of The Year, Hip Hop Album of The Year, and Music Video of The Year.

Bizzle received media attention in 2014 when he released "Same Love (A Response)" in reaction to the pro-gay rights single "[[Same Love]]" by [[Macklemore]] and [[Ryan Lewis]]. The song was controversial because it expressed opposition to homosexuality.

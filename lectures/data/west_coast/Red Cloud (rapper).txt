He toured with [[KRS-One]], [[Immortal Technique]], [[Evidence (musician)|Evidence]], [[Tech N9ne]], and [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]], among others.

After splitting with Syntax Records in 2010, he formed the independent 1491 Nations record label and released his underground mix tape, ''1491 Nation Presents: MC RedCloud'' (2011). The following year, RedCloud subsequently redefined his music with the help of collaborators [[Crystle Lightning]] and DJ Hydroe, creating a performance crew known for its electro-house/hip hop fusion featuring RedCloud’s underground spit. Called LightningCloud, Sam Slovik of the L.A. Weekly called the crew, "a near-earth object inventing new realms of the Electro-House-Hip-Hop revolution on the planet. Urban futurist[s], MC RedCloud and Crystle Lightning are L.A.’s subterranean Bonnie and Clyde." Their self-titled debut (2012) is an eclectic mix of straight hip hop (“Burn It Down”), the digital groove of [[electro house]] dance styles (e.g. “Zoom,” or “Gravitron”), hip hop inflected French [[yé-yé]] (“Hang It Up Daddy”), with a twist of B-movie slasher flick [[tango (music)|tango]] (“Zombie Love”). He travels North America as a performance artist and is known for songs that travel the globe in geography, message, and experience. His collaborative LightningCloud album (2012) features the work of time-honored collaborators, including [[Pigeon John]], DJ Wise, and producer Greg “DJ Ei8ht” Leonti. The ''LightningCloud'' album received recognition from the [[Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards]] (APCMA) for Best Hip Hop Album in November 2012.

In 2013, RedCloud battled against MCs across Southern California to win the “Who’s Next: Battle for the Best” contest on the number one hip hop station in the United States, [[Power 106]].<ref>[http://whosnext.power106.com/bftb2013#page=1] (February 25, 2012). ''Who's Next @ 2''. Retrieved March 12, 2012.</ref> As winners, his LightningCloud crew received a cash prize, a performance with [[Kendrick Lamar]], and represented west coast hip hop against [[WQHT|Hot 97’s]] Brooklyn-based, east coast representative [[Radamiz]] in a freestyle battle in Austin, Texas on March 15, 2013. After winning that MC battle,<ref>[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/03/18/lightning-cloud-win-battle-best-south-southwest-148235] (March 19, 2013). ''LightningCloud Win Best of the Best at South By Southwest''. Retrieved March 18, 2013.</ref> LightningCloud received the opportunity to use a beat produced with [[Timbaland]] for a subsequent track called ''Sake Bombs.''

RedCloud’s rhyme connects to [[Native American hip hop]], a musical genre popular with American and Canadian Indigenous peoples. Like comparable MCs old and new (including [[Litefoot]], [[RezOfficial]], [[Joey Stylez]], and [[War Party (band)|War Party]], among many others), RedCloud raps about Native issues, politics, and social consciousness. He also fuses traditional Native musics to contemporary hip hop style and provides workshops and performances to raise the Indigenous consciousness of Tribal youth.

In 2014, RedCloud broke the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for freestyle rapping that was previously set at 17 hours, and he went 18 hours one minute and 14 seconds.<ref name="HIPHOPDX">{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.31750/title.red-cloud-breaks-guinness-world-record-for-longest-freestyle-rap|title=Red Cloud Breaks Guinness World Record For Longest Freestyle Rap|first=Karina|last=Dominguez|publisher=[[HipHopDX]]|accessdate=March 1, 2015|date=December 14, 2014}}</ref>

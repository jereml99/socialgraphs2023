'''Damian Alexander Hess''' (born December 3, 1973), better known by his [[stage name]] '''MC Frontalot''', is an American rapper and web designer.
Hess began releasing music as MC Frontalot in 1999. His first successes came through [[Song Fight!]], an online songwriting and recording competition, where he became known for consistently beating opponents. Throughout his history at Song Fight!, he has never lost a competition as MC Frontalot, although he has entered only seven entries in that name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfight.org/artistpage.php?key=mc_frontalot&sortkey=date |title=MC Frontalot song archive |access-date=2007-01-30 |work=[[Song Fight!]] }}</ref> In one such song fight, entitled "Romantic Cheapskate", he likens Song Fight! to a neglected lover who favors him regardless of how he treats her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frontalot.com/index.php/content.php?page=lyrics&lyricid=29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104235325/http://frontalot.com/index.php/content.php?page=lyrics&lyricid=29 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-01-04 |title="Romantic Cheapskate" lyrics |access-date=2007-02-05 }}</ref> The song went on to garner a total of 614 votes, while the next closest song ended the round with 28.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfight.org/songpage.php?key=romantic_cheapskate |title="Romantic Cheapskate" competition |date=2004-02-13 |access-date=2007-01-30 |work=Song Fight! }}</ref>

==Career==

===Early days===
In 2000, Frontalot released the song "Nerdcore Hiphop". The song became an immediate hit in the [[geek]] and [[nerd]] communities. The [[Hip hop music|rap]] subgenre of [[nerdcore hip hop|nerdcore]], which had already been in development by various performers, embraced the title and has since been expanding rapidly.{{by whom|date=April 2018}}

Many consider Hess the founder of nerdcore. However, he has pointed out on his information webpage that many artists came before whom he considers his peers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://frontalot.com/info.html|title=MC Frontalot &#124; FAQ}}</ref>

Hess released his first [[studio album]] on August 27, 2005. Entitled ''[[Nerdcore Rising]]'', the album contained six new songs, along with 10 remixed versions of past tracks. Some of the new tracks are produced by popular online musicians from Song Fight!, including [[indie rock]] and hip hop artist Doctor Popular.

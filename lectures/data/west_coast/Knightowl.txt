'''Knightowl''' (sometimes styled as '''Mr. Knightowl''') (May 13, 1966 – February 11, 2022), born '''Ramon Corona''', was a Mexican-born American  [[rapper]]. He began recording in 1993. His fame came with the hit singles ''Daddy I'm In Love With a Gangsta'' and ''Here Comes  The Knightowl''.

== Career ==
Knightowl originally signed with [[Columbia Records]], but quickly decided to start his own record label, calling it "Sawed Off Records." His own label gave him the [[artistic freedom]] to do what he wanted. His first artist he brought on board was Mr. Shadow.

In 1994, [[Eazy-E]], founder of Ruthless Records and member of [[N.W.A|NWA]] was going to sign Knightowl, [[DJ Mikeski]] and [[Mr. Lil One]] from [[South San Diego]] as a weapon against [[DeathRow Records]], [[Suge Knight]] and [[Dr. Dre]]. Due to the sudden death of Eazy-E, this did not happen.

Knightowl, one of the biggest names in [[Chicano rap]], worked with prominent artists throughout his career: [[Big Syke]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Kid Frost]], Eazy-E, [[Lil Rob]], [[Mr Criminal]], David Salas.

Knightowl raps in [[Caló (Chicano)]] and [[Spanglish]], although English is the most prominent language in his raps. In 2000, Knightowl formed a duo with "Mr. Lil' One" for the Hollow-point collaborative venture, which released ''The Little & The Owl'' album. He was considered one of the West Coast's top [[gangsta rappers]]. He changed his name to Mr. Knightowl in 2004.<ref name="Birchmeier">Birchmeier, Jason "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:j9fpxqwhldhe~T1 Knightowl Biography]", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref>

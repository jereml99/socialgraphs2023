==Musical career==

=== 1995 – 2005: Early career and successes with Drunken Tiger ===
In 1995, Tiger JK's first solo album, ''Enter The Tiger,'' was released in Korea by Oasis Records, a connection Tiger JK had made because his father was friends with the company's CEO. The album got little airplay due to its perceived explicit content.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" />

Tiger JK returned to the United States and teamed up with [[DJ Shine]] to form the group [[Drunken Tiger]] in 1998. The group debuted in Korea and, despite the explicit content of their lyrics and the group's rejection of mainstream music trends, they achieved popularity with their first album, ''Year of the Tiger'', which included the hit songs, "I Want You" and "Do You Know Hip-hop."<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

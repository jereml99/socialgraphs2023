== Career ==
Tre Hardson began his career in the entertainment industry as a dancer and choreographer under the moniker Two for Two with his two high school friends Bootie Brown and Imani. Two for Two made numerous appearances in music videos, but had its most notable exposure with a short stint on the television show ''[[In Living Color]]''.

As a member of The Pharcyde, he has contributed to ''[[Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde]]'', as well as its follow-up release ''[[Labcabincalifornia]]''. He also worked on the third album ''[[Plain Rap]]'' with the two remaining members of The Pharcyde after [[Fatlip]]'s departure. After the release of ''Plain Rap'', Tre also decided to leave the group to pursue a solo career.

Since his departure from The Pharcyde, Tre would also go by birth name of "Tre Hardson" as well as "Slimkid3". He has also formed the band Faqawi which has accompanied him with his solo career.

In 1996, he produced [[Brian Austin Green]]'s debut album, ''[[One Stop Carnival]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/04/the-50-worst-hip-hop-fails/slim-kid-tre-brings-90210-actor-to-the-pharcyde|title=38.

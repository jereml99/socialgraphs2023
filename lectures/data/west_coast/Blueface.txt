Originally moving back to Los Angeles after leaving [[Fayetteville State University]], he was invited to his friend Laudiano's music studio to retrieve a phone charger, and after being challenged to rap over a beat, Blueface began to work to release his first song, "Deadlocs", produced by Laudiano, onto [[SoundCloud]].<ref name="laudiano">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3108334/blueface-laudiano-producer-interview/|title=Blueface Is One Of 2019's Most Promising Stars â€" His Producer Tells Us How He Got Here|website=MTV News|access-date=January 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> In June 2018, he released his first full-length project, ''[[Famous Cryp]]''.

'''Johnny Reed McKinzie Jr.''' (born March 31, 1985), better known by his stage name '''Jay Rock''', is an American rapper and songwriter. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, he signed to indie label [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] (TDE), in 2005.<ref name="MTV" /> Under TDE, Rock secured a record deal in 2007 with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and later [[Asylum Records]], but mergers fell through and Rock departed from the label shortly after. He then signed with fellow American rapper [[Tech N9ne]]'s [[Strange Music]], in a [[joint-venture]] deal with TDE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopmoneymagazine.com/top-dawg-entertainment-making-its-mark-tde/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203023434/http://hiphopmoneymagazine.com/top-dawg-entertainment-making-its-mark-tde/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |title=Top Dawg Entertainment Making {{sic|I|t's|nolink=y}} Mark……..TDE |publisher=Hiphopmoneymagazine.com |date=October 27, 2012 |access-date=August 25, 2013}}</ref>

Since 2006, Rock has amassed several TDE-released [[mixtape]]s and first gained major recognition following his 2008 commercial debut single, "[[All My Life (In the Ghetto)]]" (featuring [[Lil Wayne]] and [[will.i.am]]). In 2011, after signing his deal with Strange Music, Rock's often-delayed debut album, ''[[Follow Me Home (album)|Follow Me Home]]'', was released in July of that year. The album was supported by the aforementioned single, as well as "[[Hood Gone Love It]]" (featuring [[Kendrick Lamar]]). His second album ''[[90059]]'' was released in September 2015 and was supported by the singles "[[Money Trees Deuce]]" (featuring [[Lance Skiiiwalker]]), "Gumbo" and the title-track. In June 2018, Rock released his third album ''[[Redemption (Jay Rock album)|Redemption]]''. 

Apart from his solo career, Rock is also known for being a member of the hip hop supergroup [[Black Hippy]], alongside fellow [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast rappers]] and TDE label-mates [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Schoolboy Q]] and [[Ab-Soul]]. In 2019, Jay Rock received his first [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance]] for "[[King's Dead]]".

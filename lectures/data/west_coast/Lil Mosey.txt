=== Alleged incident ===
Upon being contacted by the [[Morton, Washington|Morton]] Police Department on January 6, 2020, the alleged victim told a detective that she attended the party with a friend and [[Blackout (drug-related amnesia)|blacked out]] after drinking [[White Claw Hard Seltzer|White Claw]] alcoholic beverages and [[champagne]] provided at the party. The woman stated that she could not clearly remember the events of the rest of the night, and could only remember walking in her underwear to an upstairs bedroom, being told by individuals that she had sex, and being told that there was video recording of the intercourse. However, she had no memory of the rape. She stated that upon waking up the following morning, she and the friend she came with left the cabin.<ref name=":4" />

On January 9, 2020, the Morton Police Department interviewed the woman's friend, who stated that she had consensual sex with Echols in his car, during which she felt a pain in her legs. She stated that she had a "fuzzy" memory of what happened afterwards, but that the next thing she remembered was multiple men forcing themselves onto her, including a man identified as Francisco P. Prater saying "wake up, wake up, suck this dick, bitch." Prater was also charged with one count of second-degree rape, in tandem with Echols' rape charge.<ref name=":8">{{Cite news|last=The Chronicle Staff|date=April 22, 2021|title=Arrest Warrants Issued for Two Men Accused of Raping Woman at Party in Randle|work=The Chronicle|url=https://www.chronline.com/stories/arrest-warrants-issued-for-two-men-accused-of-raping-woman-at-party-in-randle,262871|access-date=April 23, 2021}}</ref> She also claimed that she had bruises on her arm, neck, and inner knee that she did not know the origin of.

== Musical style ==
Yeat began making music that had [[Auto-Tune]]-infused vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Liam McCarthy|date=15 February 2022|title=Yeat is an 18-year-old rapper from Portland with a suffocating grip on catchy melodies|url=https://elevatormag.com/yeat-is-an-18-year-old-soundcloud-rapper-from-portland-with-a-suffocating-grip-on-catchy-melodies/|url-status=live|access-date=15 February 2022|website=Elevator|archive-date=February 20, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220220195631/https://www.elevatormag.com/yeat-is-an-18-year-old-soundcloud-rapper-from-portland-with-a-suffocating-grip-on-catchy-melodies}}</ref> In 2021, he adopted a more aggressive and synth-based sound, joining a growing group of rappers that used "[[rage rap|rage beats]]", a sound that became a [[SoundCloud]] staple influenced by the lively vocal deliveries and [[Electronic dance music|EDM]]-influenced beat selections of artists such as [[Playboi Carti]], specifically on ''[[Whole Lotta Red]]'' (2020).<ref name="Pierre2021b" /> His vocal style has drawn comparisons to [[Playboi Carti]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]], and [[Young Thug]].<ref name=Pierre2021b /> Yeat has stated the latter two are some of his biggest inspirations. He also cited American rapper [[T-Pain]] as one of his biggest influences growing up, calling him "The GOAT of Auto-Tune".<ref name=OGM2021 /> Yeat's signature vocal preset is based on a vocal chain given to him by frequent collaborator and fellow musician [[Weiland (musician)|Weiland]].<ref name="McKinney2022" />

Yeat has also been noted to employ a [[Ad libitum|unique lingo]] in his music, coming up with [[Ad libitum|ad-libs]] and phrases such as "twizzy", "krank", and "luh geeky", and often referring to luxury SUVs as "[[Tonka]] trucks" or "Tonkas" in his lyrics.<ref name=McKinney2022 /> His father was one of the inspirations for him creating these unique words, as he himself would make up his own words when Yeat was a child.<ref name="McKinney2022" />

Certain aspects of Yeat's music have led him to be associated with various [[Internet meme]]s and trends, especially the frequent use of bell sounds in his music.<ref name=Diaz2022/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/the-genius-communitys-50-best-songs-of-2021|title=The Genius Community's 50 Best Songs Of 2021|website=[[Genius (company)|Genius]]|date=29 December 2021|accessdate=6 July 2022|archive-date=December 31, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211231013911/https://genius.com/a/the-genius-communitys-50-best-songs-of-2021|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Alexander|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/internet-money-teams-up-with-yeah-on-the-hypnotic-single-no-handoutz-new-song.1994535.html|title=Internet Money Teams Up With Yeah On The Hypnotic Single "No Handoutz"|work=HotNewHipHop|date=22 April 2022|accessdate=6 July 2022|archive-date=July 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220707003902/https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/internet-money-teams-up-with-yeah-on-the-hypnotic-single-no-handoutz-new-song.1994535.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=de Luna|first=Elizabeth|url=https://mashable.com/article/minion-memes-tiktok-twitter|title=Minions shatters box-office records because Gen Z is obsessed with it|work=[[Mashable]]|date=5 July 2022|accessdate=6 July 2022|archive-date=July 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220707003902/https://mashable.com/article/minion-memes-tiktok-twitter|url-status=live}}</ref>

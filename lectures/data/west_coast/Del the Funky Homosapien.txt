'''Teren Delvon Jones''' (born August 12, 1972),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/del-the-funky-homosapien-mn0000194875/biography|title=Del the Funky Homosapien – Biography – AllMusic|author=Greg Prato|work=AllMusic|access-date=November 20, 2014}}</ref> better known by his stage name '''Del the Funky Homosapien''' (sometimes stylized as '''Del tha Funkee Homosapien''') or '''Sir DZL''', is an American rapper.

==Music career==
===1988–1997: Early life and beginnings===
Born in [[Oakland, California]], he is the cousin of seminal West Coast rapper [[Ice Cube]], and began his career writing lyrics for Ice Cube's group [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref name="Hiero">{{cite web|url=http://ensim.hieroglyphics.com/artists/del/|title=Del tha Amazing Homosapien|access-date=September 5, 2007|publisher=Hieroglyphics|author=Hieroglyphics|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814112553/http://ensim.hieroglyphics.com/artists/del/|archive-date=August 14, 2007}}</ref> In 1991, with the help of Ice Cube, Del released his first solo album, ''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]'',<ref name="Hiero"/> at the age of 19. The album was a commercial success largely due to the popularity of the hit single "[[Mistadobalina]]". Ultimately Del, who was not pleased with the limited musical range of the album, severed his production-artist relationship with Ice Cube for his next album, ''[[No Need for Alarm]]''.

''No Need for Alarm'' saw the introduction of the Oakland clique [[Hieroglyphics (group)|Hieroglyphics]],<ref name="Hiero"/> whose original members included [[Souls of Mischief]] (Opio, A-Plus, Phesto and Tajai), Casual, Pep Love, Del, and producer Domino. ''No Need for Alarm'' helped to expose both the regional Oakland sound of hip hop, as well as the freestyle based, "golden era 90s" style of hip hop being expanded at the time.

=== 1998–2006: Middle era ===
Del would not produce another album for five years. About a month before the release of his third album, ''[[Future Development]]'', Del received a letter from his label, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], stating that his contract had been terminated.<ref name="Hiero"/> Together with his crew, Del established his own independent record label, [[Hieroglyphics Imperium Recordings]], which primarily consists of an expanded Hieroglyphics roster and a few other artists with whom the group collaborates on a regular basis.  ''Future Development'' became available in 1998 and was only available on the Hieroglyphics website in tape form<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=118}}</ref> but was re-released in 2002 on the Hieroglyphics Imperium label. Del also released another collaborative work with the Hieroglyphics crew in 1998, which was also the Hieroglyphics crew's first album, ''[[3rd Eye Vision]]''.

[[File:Del the Funky Homosapien.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Del performing in [[Red Deer, Alberta]] in 2006]]

Two years later, Del released his fourth solo album, ''[[Both Sides of the Brain]]'', as well as ''[[Deltron 3030 (album)|Deltron 3030]]'' which was a collaborative work with artists [[Dan the Automator]] and [[Kid Koala]]. With Nakamura and Koala, Del was also a guest performer for [[Gorillaz]]'s [[Gorillaz (album)|eponymous 2001 album]]. He appeared on the singles "[[Clint Eastwood (song)|Clint Eastwood]]" and "[[Rock the House (Gorillaz song)|Rock the House]]". 2003 saw the release of ''[[Full Circle (Hieroglyphics album)|Full Circle]]'', the second full-length album from the Hieroglyphics crew.

In 2004, Elektra released ''[[The Best of Del tha Funkee Homosapien: The Elektra Years]]'' without Del's approval. The CD only includes songs from his first two albums, along with a handful of B-sides from that era. Del was not pleased and advised people to not buy the CD, saying it was just Elektra trying to make money off of him due to his newfound fame.

=== 2006–present: Recent years ===
On March 11, 2008, Del released ''[[Eleventh Hour (Del the Funky Homosapien album)|Eleventh Hour]]'' through [[Definitive Jux]]. On March 31, 2009, Del's next album ''[[Funk Man (The Stimulus Package)]]'' was made available for free download on the internet. The album is available at his page on [[Bandcamp]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delthefunkyhomosapien.bandcamp.com |title=Del The Funky Homosapien |publisher=Delthefunkyhomosapien.bandcamp.com |access-date=January 19, 2012}}</ref>  though he gave away some hard copies on his supporting Funk Man tour. In September of the same year, he released a new album, ''[[Automatik Statik]]'', for an unfixed rate with a minimum of $3.

Del released his next album ''[[It Ain't Illegal Yet]]'' on August 6, 2010. There is no fixed price for the album, allowing listeners to pay whatever they wish for the album. Paying certain prices for the album will give certain incentives, including opportunities for personal collaborations with Del. Del released the album ''[[Golden Era (Del the Funky Homosapien album)|Golden Era]]'' on April 19, 2011, in a three-disc set including ''[[Funk Man (The Stimulus Package)]]'' and ''[[Automatik Statik]]''.

Del shared a free LP entitled ''[[Iller Than Most]]'' on January 2, 2014. He uploaded the record to [[SoundCloud]] under the username Zartan Drednaught COBRA. He described the project as "lyrically ill but fun to listen to, nothing super heavy." Del handled the production on the project as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53474-listen-del-the-funky-homosapien-shares-free-lp/|title=Listen: Del the Funky Homosapien Shares Free LP|work=Pitchfork|date=January 2, 2014|access-date=November 20, 2014}}</ref>

In February 2016, Del, [[Black Thought]], [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]] and [[Fashawn]] recorded a new track called "Rise Up" for the video game ''[[Street Fighter V]]''.

Del the Funky Homosapian, Murs, Fashawn, Quest Love, Black Thought & Domino  |publisher=youtube.com |date=February 15, 2016 |access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref>

In October 2018, Deltron 3030 collaborated with the [[Cartoon Network]] animated series ''[[Craig of the Creek]]'', with Del making an appearance in the episode "The Kid from 3030" as Deltron. The episode featured original songs by Deltron 3030 made just for the episode of the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/watch-del-the-funky-homosapien-guests-on-craig-of-the-creek-oct-1/|title=Watch: Del The Funky Homosapien Guests on 'Craig of the Creek' Oct. 1|last=Milligan|first=Mercedes|date=September 28, 2018|website=Animation Magazine|access-date=October 8, 2018}}</ref> Deltron briefly returns in the Season 3 finale singing "Positive Contact" from Deltron 3030's debut album of the same name.

He has also made cameo appearances in films, such as [[Ted Demme]]'s directorial debut ''[[Who's the Man?]]'', as a teen with two members of [[Da Youngsta's]] and an uncredited [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]], and [[Jonah Hill]]'s directorial debut ''[[Mid90s]]'', as a homeless bum alongside [[Chad Muska]].

He made an guest appearance as a rapper named "Old Skool" (paying homage to Del's prominence in the 1990s) on the [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Middlemost Post]]'' on the episode "The Same Ol' Same".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/clip-del-funky-homosapien-guests-old-skool-middlemost-post|title = CLIP: Del the Funky Homosapien Guests as Old Skool in 'Middlemost Post'}}</ref>

==Collaborations==
In 1993, Del collaborated with the band [[Dinosaur Jr.]] to create the song "Missing Link", featured on the [[Judgment Night (soundtrack)|''Judgment Night'' soundtrack]].
In 1999–2000, Del collaborated with [[Kid Koala]] and [[Dan the Automator]] as the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Deltron 3030]] whose [[Deltron 3030 (album)|debut self-titled album]] was released in May 2000. Exposure from the 3030 project helped to expand Del's fan base—the 3030 project worked well as a marketing move because the CD capitalized on the growing interest of computer technology, incorporating motifs of science fiction, telling stories about life and hip hop based in the year 3030, and infusing much of the popular internet terminology and culture in circulation at the time.
A follow-up album, "Event II", was released in 2013.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150458809360030&set=a.460770785029.244985.187211000029&type=3&theater Facebook Wall Photos – Automator and I] "The album is done, Kid Koala put the final scratches/touches on it. Will probably be out sometime next year once the logistics are all figured out. Peace"</ref>  In 2005 Del worked with the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and their affiliates on the collaboration album ''[[Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture]]''.

Del collaborated with the virtual band [[Gorillaz]] on two songs on their debut album, "[[Clint Eastwood (song)|Clint Eastwood]]" and "[[Rock the House (Gorillaz song)|Rock the House]]", both of which became singles and videos and achieved chart success. Del was not, however, originally selected to collaborate on these songs. By the time Del came onto the project, the album was already finished, and British hip-hop group Phi Life Cypher had already recorded verses for "Clint Eastwood". But when Del finished making ''Deltron 3030'' with [[Dan the Automator]], Dan asked if he could stay in the studio a little longer to record new verses for the Gorillaz songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madeyoulookradio.com/del-the-funky-homosapien-interview|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130411072554/http://www.madeyoulookradio.com/del-the-funky-homosapien-interview|url-status=dead|title=Del The Funky Homosapien Interview « Made You Look Radio|date=April 11, 2013|archive-date=April 11, 2013}}</ref> For the purposes of the music videos and the Gorillaz storyline canon, Del performed under the identity of "Del the Ghost Rapper", who was said to be a spirit that was hiding from death within the band's drummer, [[Russel Hobbs]]. Del later commented in an interview on the success of "Clint Eastwood" by saying that he actually wrote the song with the book ''How to Write a Hit Song'', a book that he bought with a coupon his mother gave him. After the song went platinum he gave the plaque to his mother.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/04/19/del-the-funky-homosapien-gorillaz-clint-eastwood-rap/ |title=Del the Funky Homosapien Hit the Books for Famous Gorillaz Rap |publisher=Spinner |date=April 19, 2010 |access-date=January 19, 2012 |archive-date=September 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916213947/http://www.spinner.com/2010/04/19/del-the-funky-homosapien-gorillaz-clint-eastwood-rap/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> As part of Russel Hobbs' back-story, the character of Del was one of Russel's friends that was gunned down in a drive-by shooting, whose ghost [[Spirit possession|possessed]] Russel.<ref>{{cite book |last = Brown |first = Cass |author-link = Cass Browne |author2=Gorillaz |title = [[Rise of the Ogre]] |date = November 2, 2006 |publisher = Penguin |location = United Kingdom |isbn = 1-59448-931-9 |pages = 24–25 }}</ref>

In March 2010, Del collaborated with independent pop/funk duo Modern Science on a track called "Do It Right Now" that is available on the band's Bandcamp website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://modernscience.bandcamp.com/track/do-it-right-now |title=Do It Right Now &#124; Modern Science |publisher=Modernscience.bandcamp.com |date=March 1, 2011 |access-date=January 19, 2012}}</ref> Del collaborated on the track "Smoke Rings" with [[Dirty Heads]] on their 2012 album ''[[Cabin by the Sea]]''. In August 2012, Del appeared on the track "The Ride" from the EP ''Thrift Store Halos'' by [[¡Mayday!]].

In September 2013, Del appeared on two tracks from [[Figure (musician)|Figure]]'s ''Horns of the Apocalypse'' EP: "Beast Mode" and "War Call".

In April 2017, Del appeared (along with Carnage The Executor) on the track "Lone Wolves" from Cas One Vs Figure's "So Our Egos Don't Kill Us". In 2017, Del was a guest artist on the debut album of Halo Orbit (a band featuring [[Juan Alderete]], ex-[[The Mars Volta]] and [[Mark Guiliana]]) on the track "One Of These Days". He also appeared on the track "Pizza Shop Extended" from the album ''IWASVERYBAD'' by [[IDK (rapper)|Jay IDK]].

Using his [[Deltron 3030|Deltron]] persona, Del guests on the track "3030 Meets the Doc, Pt. 1" from [[Dr. Octagon]]'s ''Moosebumps: An Exploration Into Modern Day Horripilation''. Released on streaming services April 6, 2018, the album reunites [[Kool Keith]] with [[Dan the Automator]] and [[DJ Qbert]].<ref name="MoosebumpsRelease2018">{{cite web|last1=Mojica|first1=Nick|title=Dr. Octagon Drop New Album 'Moosebumps'|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/04/dr-octagon-moosebumps-album/|website=Xxlmag.co|date=April 6, 2018 |access-date=April 17, 2018}}</ref>

On July 7, 2018, as he was appearing with Gorillaz during the final act of the [[Roskilde Festival#2018|2018 Roskilde Festival]], Del fell off the stage during a performance of "Clint Eastwood". He was unable to get back up, and it was decided to cut the performance short. Although he was at first thought to have suffered only minor injuries, it later transpired that he had fractured seven ribs and punctured one of his lungs. He was still hospitalized in [[Roskilde]] four days after the accident.<ref name="RoskildeIncident">{{cite web|last1=Sodomsky|first1=Sam|title=Damon Albarn Says Del the Funky Homosapien Fractured Ribs, Punctured Lung in Gorillaz Stage Fall|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/damon-albarn-says-del-the-funky-homosapien-fractured-ribs-punctured-lung-in-gorillaz-stage-fall|website=Pitchfork.com|date=July 11, 2018|access-date=July 12, 2018}}</ref> According to his Facebook page and official website, Del was back out touring in September 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.facebook.com/OfficialDELTRON/|title=Deltron 3030|website=M.facebook.com|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref>

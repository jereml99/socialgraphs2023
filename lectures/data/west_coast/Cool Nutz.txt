'''Terrance Scott''' (born May 11, 1972),<ref name="Hip Hop in America">Hess, 2009 p. 303.</ref> better known by his stage name '''Cool Nutz''', is an American rapper, radio personality, entrepreneur, tour manager and record label owner.
He was born and raised in the [[Woodlawn, Portland, Oregon]] neighborhood. Growing up in Northeast Portland, he gained knowledge by the gangs and violence around him.

== Music career ==
Cool Nutz is most known for his involvement and promotion of the Portland, OR and [[San Francisco Bay Area]] hip-hop scene.<ref name="Spinner Interview">{{cite web|last=Morales|first=Margarita|title=Cool Nutz Interview: SXSW 2010|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/03/07/sxsw-2010-cool-nutz/|publisher=Spinner|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> He co-founded Jus Family Records in 1992 with Bosko Kante. His musical style originally used primarily [[G-funk]] synthesizer elements but has evolved to the addition of vocal and instrumental samples in his tracks.

In 1995, Scott co-founded the Portland Oregon Hip-Hop (POH-Hop) Festival.<ref name="This is Portland">{{cite web|last=Shepherd|first=Julianne|title=This is Portland Hiphop|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/this-is-portland-hiphop/Content?oid=30406|publisher=The Portland Mercury|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> He has worked very hard to create and maintain the hip-hop scene in Portland and has worked with many rappers from the bay area, most notably "[[E-40]]" and "[[Yukmouth]]." In 1997, he signed the group [[G-Ism]], made up of fellow Portland rappers Ray Ray and Young Randall to his label, Jus Family Records. They released their debut album, "[[On a Mission (G-Ism featuring Cool Nutz album)|On a Mission]]" in 1998, under Jus Family Records. [[G-Ism]] disbanded in 2001 following the tragic and untimely passing of Young Randall.

Cool Nutz is the radio host of the Breakout Show on [[KXJM]] JAM'N 107.5.<ref name="JAM'N 107.5">{{cite web|title=The Breakout Show|url=http://jamn1075.com/onair/the-northwest-breakout-show-35616/|publisher=Clear Channel Media Entertainment|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> The show airs Sunday nights from 9 p.m. to midnight.

Along with fellow Jus Family Records affiliate, Maniac Lok, Cool Nutz is featured on Track 11, "Pussy Loud," from the 2012 [[E-40]] album [[The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 3]].

Scott managed the 2012 [[Group Hug Tour]] for [[Kreayshawn]] to promote her debut album, [[Somethin' 'Bout Kreay]], released on [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="Oregon Live">{{cite web|last=White|first=Ryan|title=Cool Nutz celebrates 'Bars' on Saturday at Ash Street Saloon|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/music/index.ssf/2013/05/cool_nutz_celebrates_bars_on_s.html|publisher=Oregon Live|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref>

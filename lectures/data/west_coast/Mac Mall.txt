=== 1993 ===
In 1993, Mac Mall released his debut album ''[[Illegal Business?]]'' on Young Black Brotha Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sfbayview.com/2009/10/mac-to-the-future-an-interview-wit%E2%80%99-bay-area-rap-kingpin-mac-mall-part-1/|title=Mac to the Future: an interview wit' Bay Area rap kingpin Mac Mall, Part 1|publisher=Bayview National Black Newspaper|date=October 10, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Mac Mall owes career success to Vallejo raising |url=https://www.timesheraldonline.com/2014/03/30/mac-mall-owes-career-success-to-vallejo-raising/ |access-date=6 August 2023 |work=[[Vallejo Times Herald]] |date=30 March 2014}}</ref> Entirely produced by [[Khayree|Khayree Shaheed]], the album featured [[Ray Luv]] and [[Mac Dre]]. ''Illegal Business?'' moved over 200,000 units independently, a major feat for an independent artist and record label. He met Tupac Shakur shortly after the album's release, who after praising Mac's music offered to direct a video for the single "Ghetto Theme".<ref name="KQED 2023"/> In 1995 he contributed a verse to [[E-40]]'s "Dusted and Disgusted" and [[8Ball & MJG|Eightball & MJG]]'s "Friend or Foe". In 1996 he signed a record deal with [[Relativity Records]], which released his second, and most commercially successful album, ''[[Untouchable (Mac Mall album)|Untouchable]]''.<ref name="Shapiro" /><ref name="Birchmeier">Birchmeier, Jason "[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p100345|pure_url=yes}} Mac Mall Biography]", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref>

=== 1996 ===
In 1996, he appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s [[compilation album]], [[America Is Dying Slowly]], alongside [[Biz Markie]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], and [[Fat Joe]], among many other prominent hip hop artists.  The album, meant to raise awareness of the [[AIDS]] epidemic among African American men, was heralded as "a masterpiece" by [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] magazine.<ref>{{cite web |title=AMERICA IS DYING SLOWLY 1996 |url=https://redhot.org/project/america-is-dying-slowly/ |website=[[Red Hot Organization]] |access-date=19 September 2023}}</ref>

=== 1999 ===
In 1999, he started his own label, Sesed Out Records. The label's first release was the [[Compilation album|compilation]] ''[[Mallennium|Mac Mall Presents the Mallennium]]'', followed by his first solo album on the label and third overall, ''[[Illegal Business? 2000]]'' a year later. Though no longer on a major label, he still managed to achieve success on ''Illegal Business? 2000'', which spawned what is perhaps his most well known single, "Wide Open".<ref name="Shapiro" /><ref name="Birchmeier" /> ''[[Immaculate (album)|Immaculate]]'' followed in 2001, which would find him once again reuniting with longtime collaborator Khayree Shaheed. After 2002's ''Mackin Speaks Louder Than Words'', he took a 4-year hiatus from solo albums, instead focusing on collaborative efforts with JT the Bigga Figga and Mac Dre. He began work on an album with Mac Dre, which would be called ''Da U.S. Open''. Unfortunately, Dre passed before the album was released, and it ended up being some of Dre's final recordings.<ref name="Azpiri">Azpiri, John "[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r520523|pure_url=yes}} ''Immaculate'' Review]", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref>

=== 2006 ===

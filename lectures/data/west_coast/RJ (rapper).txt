==Musical career==
=== 2013–present: ''O.M.M.I.O.'' series and collaborations ===
In 2013, RJ released his debut mixtape ''O.M.M.I.O'' (which stands for ''On My Mama I'm On''). The mixtape was hosted and largely produced by [[DJ Mustard]]. The first song from this mixtape, "Ride Wit Me" was included and released, as the single. RJ then appeared on the songs; "Thank God (Interlude)" and "When I Was Gone" from [[YG (rapper)|YG]]'s debut album, ''[[My Krazy Life]]'' (2014). In July 2014, RJ released his second mixtape ''Takin Niggas Beats'', featuring local rappers; Shoota300, JaywhiteT, and [[Vince Staples]] (on a contrary to his first mixtape). Unfortunately disagreements between them erupted, which led to RJ dropping their names from the project entirely. The beats on this mixtape were solely from made-up beats from the other rappers that were remixed by RJ. On the same year, DJ Mustard released his debut album ''[[10 Summers]]'', where RJ appeared on the tracks; including "Low Low", "Throw Your Hood Up" and "No Reason".<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/10-summers/id909085414 10 Summers by DJ Mustard on Apple Music]. Itunes.apple.com (August 25, 2014). Retrieved on 2016-10-29.</ref> 

At the beginning of 2015, RJ collaborated with Choice to release a critically acclaimed mixtape, ''Rich Off Mackin''. Additionally, RJ appeared on the DJ Mustard's mixtape, titled ''Ketchup'', as well as one of YG's mixtapes ''Just Re'd Up 2''.<ref>[http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/dj-mustard-ketchup-mixtape.84550.html DJ Mustard – Ketchup | Download & Listen [New Mixtape&#93;].

The song "Get Rich" (with Choice featuring [[Iamsu!]]) was included and released as the lead single. Both of these singles; his 2013's single, "Ride Wit Me" and his 2015's single, "Get Rich", did not chart, both songs received radio airplay throughout the West Coast. He also contributed to the soundtrack for the ''[[NBA 2K16]]''{{'s}} video game by being featured in the original song "You Don't Want It" with frequent collaborator and 10 Summers Records founder [[DJ Mustard]].

RJ also released TNB 2 (Takin Niggas Beats) on October 11, 2016.<ref>[http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2016/06/rj-interview-the-break/ The Break Presents: RJ – XXL]. Xxlmag.com.

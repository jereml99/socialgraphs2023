== Career ==

=== 2008–2013: Career beginnings ===
{{Quote box|quote="I was hanging out with drug dealers and thieves and the pretty girls that were popular. The kids thought I was kind of bad. Not reckless, but a badass. A lot of people really look up to me. I kind of represent them. It's like, they'll stand behind me, but they won't stand beside me."|source=ILoveMakonnen in an interview with journalist Naomi Zeichner from ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' magazine in August 2014.<ref name="bf1" />|align=right|width=30%|style=padding:12px}}

Makonnen started making songs on his computer and uploading them to [[MySpace]]. On this website, he met rising musicians, such as [[Adele]]. Makonnen also created a blog, where he would post interviews with musicians such as [[Lil B]] and [[Soulja Boy|Soulja Boy Tell'em]].<ref name="bf1">{{cite web|last1 = Zeichner|first1 = Naomi|title = Meet ILoveMakonnen, The Eccentric Rapper Drake And Miley Cyrus Want To Be Down With| date=August 13, 2014 |url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/naomizeichner/who-is-ilovemakonnen#436q2cz|publisher = BuzzFeed|access-date = August 31, 2014}}</ref>

After a period under house arrest following the accidental fatal shooting of a friend,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/i-love-makonnen/id485530148|title = Itunes biography|access-date = November 10, 2014|website = Itunes|publisher = Apple}}</ref> he enrolled in a [[cosmetology]] school and became a part of a group called Phantom Posse.<ref name="bf1" /><ref>{{cite news| author = Skinny Friedman| title =Everybody Loves Makonnen| quote =I was on house arrest and was going to cosmetology school.

However, because of Mike Will's busy schedule, the two were not able to meet often, and soon were separated from each other.<ref name="vice2" />

=== 2014: Rise to prominence ===
In March 2014, [[record producer]] Mike Will Made It would reply to Makonnen and brought him to the DTP studios, where he played some of his songs towards a fellow producer [[Metro Boomin]]. Metro instantly liked Makonnen and stayed in touch with him. Later, after recording six songs together, Metro brought these fellow Atlanta producers [[Sonny Digital]] and [[808 Mafia]], who were all unusually impressed with him. Two days later, Makonnen recorded the song, titled "Don't Sell Molly No More" with Sonny Digital, which would later launch his music career. Sonny Digital introduced him to the other Atlanta producers such as DJ Spinz, [[Dun Deal]] and St. Louis producer Cammy Recklezz. He started gaining local fame within the community with songs such as "Living on the Southside", "Sneaky Lady" and "My New Friend".<ref name="xxl1-2">{{cite news|last1=Diep|first1=Eric|title=The Come Up: iLoveMakonnen (page 3)|newspaper=XXL Mag|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/2014/08/the-come-up-ilovemakonnen/3/|publisher=XXL|access-date=August 31, 2014}}</ref> Makonnen was then featured on Mike Will's mixtape, titled Ransom.

In July 2014, the singer released his self-titled EP ''[[ILoveMakonnen (EP)|iLoveMakonnen]]'', which included the singles "Tuesday" and "I Don't Sell Molly No More".<ref name=vice1>{{cite web|last1=Sundermann|first1=Eric|title=MAKONNEN EXPLAINS THE DRAKE REMIX: "IT'S THE BEST TUESDAY EVER!"|date=August 12, 2014 |url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_au/blog/makonnen-drake-club-goin-up-interview|publisher=Vice|access-date=August 31, 2014}}</ref> The latter reached pop singer [[Miley Cyrus]], who shared it on her Instagram.

How could you not have a good time listening to this song?

In August 2014, after hearing "Tuesday", [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] asked one of the song's producers, Sonny Digital, if he could remix the song. Makonnen agreed to send it to Drake, but didn't think much of it. However, two days later Drake released a remix.<ref name=mtv1>{{cite web|last1=Fleischer|first1=Adam|title=ILOVEMAKONNEN Wept When He Heard Drake's 'Club Goin' Up On A Tuesday' Remix|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1905320/ilovemakonnen-cried-tears-of-joy-drake-club-goin-up-on-a-tuesday-remix/|publisher=MTV|access-date=August 31, 2014}}</ref> Makonnen later commented: "Yeah, I surprised. Shocking. Drake listens to Makonnen. It was great. I was excited. Surprised, shocked. Just overwhelmed."<ref name="xxl1" /> The remix, simply titled "Tuesday" went viral and led to increased media interest in iLoveMakonnen.<ref name="vice1" /><ref name=pf1>{{cite web|last1=Camp|first1=Zoe|title=Drake Jumps on iLoveMakonnen's "Tuesday"|date=August 12, 2014|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/56274-drake-jumps-on-ilovemakonnens-tuesday/|publisher=Pitchfork Media|access-date=August 31, 2014}}</ref>

In August 2014, Makonnen was featured in ''[[XXL Magazine|XXL]]''{{'}}s The Come Up section, which focuses on new artists.<ref name="xxl1" /> He later stated he was not looking for a major label deal and instead planned to go touring and record music independently: "I'm not too thirsty to sign a deal. Cause a label will really just take all your free music down and you have to be somebody's bitch." On September 1, 2014, it was announced that Makonnen had signed to Drake's label [[OVO Sound]], which is distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name=billboard1>{{cite web|last1=Brandle|first1=Lars|title=ILoveMakonnen Signs To Drake's OVO Sound|date=September 2014|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6236546/ilovemakonnen-signs-to-drakes-ovo-sound|publisher=Billboard|access-date=September 1, 2014}}</ref>

=== 2015–2016: OVO Sound and ''I LOVE MAKONNEN 2'' ===
In an interview with ''[[The Fader]]'' in December 2015, more than a year after signing to [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]{{'}}s [[OVO Sound]], Makonnen said the label delayed tracks from ''I LOVE MAKONNEN 2'' from coming out. The song "Second Chance," for example, was finished in January 2015 and intended for a summer release,<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title = Damn, Makonnen|url = http://www.thefader.com/2015/12/03/makonnen-interview-ilovemakonnen-2-ovo|website = The FADER|access-date = January 22, 2016}}</ref> but ended up being self-released by Makonnen in November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title = iLoveMakonnen Shares DJ Mustard-Produced "Second Chance", Announces iLoveMakonnen 2|url = http://pitchfork.com/news/62116-ilovemakonnen-shares-dj-mustard-produced-second-chance-announces-ilovemakonnen-2/|website = Pitchfork|date = November 15, 2015|access-date = January 22, 2016}}</ref> Makonnen said, "Second Chance was supposed to be that summer banger this summer. That was supposed to be out, touching people and hitting them this summer. By the time next year they'll be ready for something else. It's all late. People are doubting me, doubting what the fuck I said when I made the fucking song. You wait a year later and it's whatever. Hopefully, it's worked right. The song is structured properly. Everything is all there for proper radio play to just spin it over and over to people. Who knows? I don't know what the fuck they want."<ref name=":0" />

Makonnen also claimed "extra bullshit in the industry" stopped "Teach Me How To Whip It" and "No M'aam" from getting radio play. When asked if he still talked to Drake, Makonnen responded, "Here and there. By the time this comes out, I'll probably see him six more times or no more times. I don't know. I just wish everybody well in all that they do and I just go on and live my life and try to uplift motherfuckers. At the end of the day I'm tired of uplifting people. I just gotta uplift myself now because everything else is a waste of time."<ref name=":0" />

Makonnen also described the music scene: "There's not even any money here anymore. It's all lies. The money's gone and everybody is now keeping up this front as if there's money there."<ref name=":0" />

On February 8, 2016, it was announced that alongside [[Travis Scott (musician)|Travis Scott]] and [[Vic Mensa]], Makonnen would be part of the "WANGSQUAD", an [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/travis-scott-vic-mensa-makonnen-to-be-featured-in-new-alexander-wang-campaign-news.20050.html|title=Ilove Makonnen part of Wang Campaign|last=Smith|first=Trevor|work=Hotnewhiphop|date=February 8, 2016|access-date=February 8, 2016}}</ref>

=== 2016–present: Departure from OVO Sound ===
On April 18, 2016, Makonnen parted ways with Drake's label [[OVO Sound]], saying the "choice to be solely on [[Warner Bros. Records]] was the right thing for me and for my best interest."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/64930-ilovemakonnen-parts-ways-with-ovo-sound/|title=iLoveMakonnen Parts Ways With OVO Sound {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|date=April 19, 2016|access-date=May 3, 2016}}</ref> On May 7, 2016, Makonnen announced he would be retiring from music to focus on acting but released a new song shortly after, with confirmation of a new project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1876713/ilovemakonnen-says-hes-retiring-from-rap-then-releases-new-song/mp3s/|title=ILoveMakonnen Says He's Retiring From Rap, Then Releases New Song|website=stereogum.com|date=May 12, 2016|access-date=May 14, 2016}}</ref>

In the late summer of 2017, Makonnen collaborated on an album with [[Lil Peep]] in London. The album was scrapped after Makonnen leaked it online in May 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://hitsdailydouble.com/news&id=310941|title=HITS Daily Double : Rumor Mill – PEEP THIS|work=HITS Daily Double|access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref> On August 17, 2018, Makonnen announced a single he co-wrote titled "[[Falling Down (Lil Peep and XXXTentacion song)|Falling Down]]", a reworking of "[[Falling Down (Lil Peep and XXXTentacion song)#"Sunlight on Your Skin"|Sunlight On Your Skin]]" that he recorded with Peep during the sessions in London.

== Biography ==

Reece grew up on the 35th block of [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|East Oakland]] in a neighborhood known for dealing drugs and a high crime rate.<ref name="laweekly1">{{cite web|last=Haithcoat|first=Rebecca|title=V-Nasty as She Wants to Be|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2011-11-10/music/v-nasty-as-she-wants-to-be/|publisher=[[LA Weekly]]|accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref> She was born to a [[white people|white]] mother and a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] father.<ref name="complex_bio">{{citation |last=Ahmed|first=Insanul|title=Who Is V-Nasty?|url= http://www.complex.com/music/2011/12/who-is-v-nasty|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|access-date=August 9, 2013}}</ref><ref name="xxl1" /> Reece had a rough childhood – she was skipping classes, stealing alcohol, and was in and out of jail. She attended [[Skyline High School (Oakland, California)|Skyline High School]] before dropping out of ninth grade. While in sixth grade, both of her parents were arrested. During her teen years, Reece has had various jobs, including working in a chocolate factory called Grand Avenue Chocolates.<ref name=laweekly2>{{citation |last=Haithcoat|first=Rebecca|title=V-Nasty on Jail, Being Pregnant at 15, and Why Oakland Is Not Where It's At|url= http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2011/11/v-nasty_interview.php|publisher=[[LA Weekly]]|access-date=August 9, 2013}}</ref> At 15, she gave birth to the first of her two children.<ref name="laweekly1" /> Reece was inspired by her cousin and her child's father to start rapping. She started [[freestyle rap|freestyling]] around 2009, and later, after gaining some popularity, realized she could pursue a career in music.<ref name="complex_bio" />

In January 2010, Reece was caught committing a robbery at a [[Pick-n-Pull]] store. During a chase with the police, her car's transmission broke and would only go in reverse. She was arrested on robbery charges. She was released after a short prison sentence but was arrested again after committing another robbery in July.<ref name="laweekly2" /> She was then sentenced to serve six months in [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] [[Santa Rita Jail]]. Reece was released from jail in December 2010, while remaining on probation.<ref name="laweekly1" />

Reece met rapper [[Kreayshawn]], after confronting her following rumors that she had made Reece's cousin start taking drugs. After the rumors turned out to be false, the two became friends and started performing together. They created the group [[White Girl Mob]], together with [[Lil Debbie]]. In April 2011, Reece released her debut mixtape, ''Don't Bite, Just Taste,'' recorded in one day and consisting entirely of freestyles.<ref name="complex_bio" /> Reece was arrested again later in 2011. Shortly after, Kreayshawn started a campaign "Free V-Nasty" in support of her fellow rapper.<ref name="complex_bio" /> When Kreayshawn's video for "[[Gucci Gucci]]" became popular, Reece's alias V-Nasty gained fame, because of the lines: "I'm yelling 'Free V-Nasty' 'til my throat is raspy."<ref name=xxl1>{{citation |last=Fleisher|first=Adam|title=V-Nasty: "If I Can't Say the N-Word, Then Nobody Should Say It"|url= http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2011/12/v-nasty-if-i-cant-say-the-n-word-then-nobody-should-say-it/|publisher=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|access-date=August 9, 2013}}</ref>

In 2011, Reece was contacted by Atlanta rapper [[Gucci Mane]] who offered her to collaborate on an album. Before the release of the project, she was approached by several record labels, who offered to sign her, but she declined, feeling not ready for a major deal at the time.<ref name="xxl1" /> Her debut studio album with Gucci Mane, titled ''[[BAYTL]]'', was released on December 13, 2011, through [[Vice Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]]. ''BAYTL'' was produced almost entirely by Gucci Mane's frequent collaborator [[Zaytoven]] and features guest appearances by [[Mistah F.A.B.]], [[Taylor Gang Records|Berner]] and Slim Dunkin among others.<ref name="complex_bio" /> Gucci Mane called it "by far ... my most controversial mixtape to date" and commented that many people would be surprised by it.<ref>{{citation |title=Gucci Mane and V-Nasty Collaborate For 'BAYTL' Street Album, Release First Single|date= November 23, 2011|url= http://www.vibe.com/article/gucci-mane-and-v-nasty-collaborate-baytl-street-album-release-first-single|publisher=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|access-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref> The album was preceded by the single "Whip Appeal", which premiered on November 2, 2011, and was released officially on November 18.<ref>{{citation |title=Whip Appeal (feat.

The latter got in an altercation with [[rapper]] Young Vito and a fight broke out, resulting in Dunkin being shot dead. The video shoot was cancelled, and Vito was arrested on murder charges. He was later acquitted of murder but convicted of aggravated assault and gun possession charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison.<ref>{{citation |last=Kaufmann|first=Gil|title=Young Vito Acquitted Of Slim Dunkin Murder|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1702624/young-vito-slim-dunkin-murder.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Young Vito Indicted for Slim Dunkin Murder|date=March 22, 2012|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/young-vito-indicted-for-slim-dunkin-murder-20120322|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Hyden|first=Steven|title=Atlanta rapper Slim Dunkin murdered before a video shoot|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/atlanta-rapper-slim-dunkin-murdered-before-a-video,66764/|website=[[The A.V.

On March 2, 2012, Reece released her second mixtape ''Doin' Number$'', featuring guest appearances from Mistah F.A.B., Roach Gigz and Erk Tha Jerk.<ref name="complex2">{{citation |last=Martin|first=Andrew|title=Mixtape: V-Nasty "Doin' Number$"}}</ref> In March 2013, Reece performed at the [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) Festival. In April, after parting ways with Kreayshawn, she signed to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]-based independent label Pinnacle Records in a highly publicized $750,000 deal. She also started working with ''[[American Idol]]'' host [[Ryan Seacrest]] on her reality TV show.<ref name="laweekly3" />

On her 24th birthday, she released a new [[Mixtape]] titled "11Lem", along with a new single titled "Tweekin". On February 16, 2015, she posted a short clip of the music video which has yet to be released.

== Personal life and influence ==

Reece has stated she is influenced by [[Too $hort]], [[3X Krazy]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Gucci Mane]], [[Webbie]], [[Lil Boosie]] and [[Mac Dre]], and listens to a lot of [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] music.<ref name="complex_bio" /> Producer [[Zaytoven]] compared her style to that of [[Gucci Mane]], saying "she'll get in trouble, she don't care about what she say, she just bein' free."<ref>{{cite web|last=Stovall|first=Calvin|title=Zaytoven: V-Nasty Reminds Me of a Young Gucci Mane|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2012/02/01/zaytoven-v-nasty-reminds-me-of-a-young-gucci-mane.html|publisher=[[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]|access-date=August 11, 2013}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
Reece has been criticized for the use of the word "[[nigga]]" in her songs, although she defended it as being used in a friendly way and part of her city's culture.<ref name="xxl2">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2011/11/v-nasty-defends-her-use-of-the-n-word/|title=V-Nasty Defends Her Use of the N-Word|publisher=XXL|access-date=August 9, 2013}}</ref> Rapper [[David Banner]] released a song condemning her actions,<ref name="xxl1" /> while [[Mistah F.A.B.]] came to her defense, stating that Oakland has a culture of its own and claimed Reece and her group White Girl Mob are a product of that environment.<ref name=xxl3>{{cite web|title=Mistah F.A.B.

In November 2012, Reece accused [[Soulja Boy]] of being a "fake ass industry rapper" and compared him unfavorably to his girlfriend [[Diamond (rapper)|Diamond]] of [[Crime Mob]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ugwu|first=Reggie|title=V-Nasty Takes Aim at Soulja Boy on Twitter|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2012/11/27/v-nasty-takes-aim-at-soulja-boy-on-twitter.html|publisher=BET|access-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref> Soulja Boy refused to engage in a [[Hip hop feud|beef]] commenting: "What would I look like fighting with a girl?"<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogulewski|first=Charley|title=Soulja Boy Takes the High Road in V-Nasty Beef|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/soulja-boy-takes-high-road-v-nasty-beef|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|access-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref> Her ongoing feud with her alleged ex-boyfriend Magneto Dayo seemed to have been over when they collaborated on a song entitled "Hate u"<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/device/mp3/store/album/B00E5XNXPW#album/B00E5XNXPW "Hate u"]</ref> (the breakup) but the fire was once again lit when she threatened him in an interview saying, "I'll kick his ass" and denying ever lying about the paternity of her child. Magneto Dayo retaliated with a song called "OJ Simpson" in which he claimed she turned her back on him and others that were there for her before her fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2013/05/v-nasty_magneto_dayo_oj_simpson.php |title=V-Nasty's Alleged Ex Fires Back With Song Referencing OJ Simpson - Los Angeles - Music - West Coast Sound |website=blogs.laweekly.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510092542/http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2013/05/v-nasty_magneto_dayo_oj_simpson.php |archive-date=2013-05-10}}</ref>

'''Thebe Neruda Kgositsile''' (born February 24, 1994), also known by his stage name '''Earl Sweatshirt''', is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Kgositsile was originally known by the moniker '''Sly Tendencies''' when he began rapping in 2008, but soon changed his name when [[Tyler, the Creator]] invited him to join his [[music collective|alternative hip hop collective]] [[Odd Future]] in late 2009.

He gained recognition and critical praise for his debut [[mixtape]], ''[[Earl (mixtape)|Earl]]'', which he released in March 2010, at the age of 16. Shortly after its release, his mother sent him to a boarding school in [[Samoa]] for at-risk teens for a year and a half. He was unable to record music during his stay there, but returned to Los Angeles in February 2012, just before his eighteenth birthday. Kgositsile rejoined Odd Future and started producing new music, releasing his debut studio album, ''[[Doris (album)|Doris]]'', in August 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Huynh|first=Davis|date=2013-08-15|title=Earl Sweatshirt - Doris (Album Stream)|url=https://hypebeast.com/2013/8/earl-sweatshirt-doris-album-stream|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-19|website=HYPEBEAST}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Coulston|first=John Connor|date=2013-08-27|title=Earl Sweatshirt flexes his lyrical muscle on debut album 'Doris' {{!}} Album Review|url=https://mtsusidelines.com/2013/08/27/earl-sweatshirt-flexes-his-lyrical-muscle-on-his-debut-album-doris-album-review/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-19|website=Sidelines|language=en-US}}</ref>

His second album, ''[[I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside]]'', followed in March 2015, and his third, ''[[Some Rap Songs]]'', released in November 2018. His projects have all received widespread critical praise. He is currently signed to his independent label Tan Cressida, which was formerly distributed by [[Columbia Records]]. On November 1, 2019, Kgositsile released an [[extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Feet of Clay (EP)|Feet of Clay]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/feet-of-clay/1483686252|title=FEET OF CLAY by Earl Sweatshirt|author=thebe|date=November 1, 2019|website=iTunes|language=en|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref> Earl released the deluxe version of ''Feet of Clay'' a few months after and then took a year off from music to start working on his next album. In late 2021, Earl released the single "2010" and then released two more singles before releasing his fourth studio album ''[[Sick!]]''.

== Early life ==
Thebe Neruda Kgositsile was born on February 24, 1994, in [[Chicago, Illinois]], to [[Cheryl Harris]], a law professor and [[Critical race theory|critical race theorist]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and [[Keorapetse Kgositsile]], a South African poet and political activist. Harris and Kgositsile separated when Thebe was six years old.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} His father is often mentioned in Kgositsile's music and was called a "complicated figure" by [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]. He was presented as a person that was often absent in Kgositsile's life,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-01-03 |title=Earl Sweatshirt's Father, Poet Keorapetse Kgositsile, Dead at 79 |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/earl-sweatshirts-father-poet-keorapetse-kgositsile-dead-at-79/ |access-date=2023-04-16 |website=Pitchfork |language=en-US}}</ref> due to him living in South Africa while Kgositsile lived in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Kgositsile stated that "Me and my dad had a relationship that's not uncommon for people to have with their fathers, which is a non-perfect one, talking to him is symbolic and non-symbolic, but it's literally closure for my childhood. Not getting to have that moment left me to figure out a lot with my damn self."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-11-20 |title=Earl Sweatshirt Releasing New Album Some Rap Songs Next Week, Shares "The Mint": Listen |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/earl-sweatshirt-shares-new-song-the-mint-listen/ |access-date=2023-04-17 |website=Pitchfork |language=en-US}}</ref> Kgositsile attended the [[UCLA Lab School]] in Los Angeles and New Roads Middle School & High School in [[Santa Monica, California]].

{{Main|Earl (mixtape)}}
In 2009, fellow rapper [[Tyler, the Creator]] discovered Kgositsile via his [[MySpace]] account after he reached out to Tyler to tell him he was a fan of his work. Kgositsile later changed his pseudonym to Earl Sweatshirt and eventually joined Tyler's rap group [[Odd Future]].

His debut mixtape, ''[[Earl (album)|Earl]]'', was self-released on March 31, 2010, for free digital download on the Odd Future website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oddfuture.tumblr.com/post/486144881/earl-sweatshirt-earl |title=OFWGKTA: Earl Sweatshirt – EARL|publisher=Oddfuture.tumblr.com|date=March 31, 2010|access-date=February 27, 2011}}</ref> Most of the mixtape was produced by Tyler, the Creator.

Despite positive reactions from both critics and fans, various sources indicated that Kgositsile had stopped making music with Odd Future.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2010-10-14/music/the-future-is-odd/2/|last=Caroline|first=Ryder|title=The Future Is Odd – Page 2 – Music – Los Angeles|newspaper=[[LA Weekly]]|date=October 14, 2010|access-date=February 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oddfuture.tumblr.com/post/2480741386/fuck-watching-this-video-kills-us-inside-we-miss|title=OFWGKTA: FUCK!

Kgositsile later expressed in an interview that his mother sent him to [[Samoa]] due to getting into trouble with friends. Kgositsile attended Coral Reef Academy, a therapeutic retreat school for at-risk boys, located outside of the Samoan capital of [[Apia]].<ref name="backfromwilderness"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Rosenberg Radio|author-link=Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|title=Interview with Peter Rosenberg|via=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8SU097uOPA |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/s8SU097uOPA |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|date=March 20, 2012|access-date=October 7, 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref> At Coral Reef Academy, Kgositsile worked to earn back privileges and the opportunity to return home.

Kgositsile's hiatus from making music led to a movement known as "Free Earl", which stemmed from a post on Odd Future's [[Tumblr]]. Chants of the phrase would ensue at the group's shows, and would appear throughout several songs by both the collective and its individual members – leading to media coverage of the movement itself.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eichler |first1=Alex |title=Earl Sweatshirt Wants You to Knock Off the 'Free Earl' Stuff |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2011/05/earl-sweatshirt-wants-you-knock-free-earl-stuff/350723/ |website=The Atlantic |date=May 16, 2011 |publisher=The Wire Media |access-date=7 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Sanneh |first1=Kelefa |title=Where's Earl? |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/23/wheres-earl |magazine=The New Yorker |date=May 16, 2011  |access-date=7 January 2022}}</ref>

Kgositsile appeared on the song "Oldie" from Odd Future's debut album ''[[The OF Tape Vol.&nbsp;2]]''. This was Earl's return to official Odd Future releases and his first appearance on an Odd Future Records release.

On April 28, 2015, a ten-minute track named "Solace" was released via YouTube and has gained much attention; gaining more than 100,000 views on YouTube in 24 hours. He stated to NPR that he was making an album called "Solace" inspired by his mother; however, many believe it is instead an extended play. The project has not been addressed fully.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3q_0UP6sck |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/d3q_0UP6sck |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title = solace|website=[[YouTube]] |date=April 28, 2015|access-date=August 9, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> It was widely debated if Kgositsile left Odd Future or not. He seemingly confirmed he had left through his Twitter on May 28, 2015, by tweeting "No sympathy for male virgins who're in their feelings about Tyler pointing out and solidifying the obvious" after Tyler, the Creator tweeted what everyone thought was the disbandment of Odd Future, although Tyler denies an Odd Future disbandment. Earl did not appear at Camp Flog Gnaw 2015 on November 14, 2015. Many speculated that Tyler, the Creator did not invite Earl to perform at the Carnival because of a feud or conflict between the two. However, Tyler tweeted the day after the carnival "Thebe and I are fine by the way".

In August 2023, a hyperlink titled "hahaha" was added to Kgositsile's website that led to the Gala Music site that would update with new puzzles everyday, teasing a new project.

== Career ==
Aston's career began as a roadie for bands Boot Party, [[AFI (band)|AFI]], and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]].<ref name="gwhatchet">{{cite web|url=https://www.gwhatchet.com/2002/12/05/interview-rob-aston-you-know-that-kid-who-plays-with-tim-armstrong-and-that-kid-from-blink-182/|title=INTERVIEW: Rob Aston, you know, that kid who plays with Tim Armstrong and that kid from blink-182|first=Andrew|last=Phillips|publisher=[[GW Hatchet]]|date=December 5, 2002}}</ref> He eventually started a solo career, releasing the song "Show Me". He became involved in the [[Transplants (band)|Transplants]] when [[Tim Armstrong]] asked for lyrics to the songs Aston had been writing. The two started jamming in Armstrong's basement. They eventually invited [[Travis Barker]] of [[Blink-182]] to provide drum tracks, instead of using drum-loops as originally planned.

At the end of the 2005 [[Vans Warped Tour]], [[Transplants (band)|Transplants]] took a hiatus and Rob and Travis joined [[Houston]] rapper [[Paul Wall]], who [[chopped and screwed]] the Transplants' ''[[Haunted Cities]]'' album, to form a new group called [[Expensive Taste]]. He has been interviewed by [[Nardwuar the Human Serviette]], along with Travis. As of January 2010, according to drummer [[Travis Barker]], the [[Transplants (band)|Transplants]] are active again and currently planning a third album.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/trvsbrkr/status/7287434312 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120730012325/http://twitter.com/trvsbrkr/status/7287434312 | url-status = dead | archive-date = July 30, 2012 | title = Get ready for new TRAN$PLANT$ music | publisher = Twitter | date = January 1, 2010 | access-date = January 13, 2010}}</ref> As of  2021, it has indeed been released.

Aston sang on the track "Red Hot Moon" about his sister, from [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]'s ''[[Indestructible (Rancid album)|Indestructible]]'' album and participated in the music video. Aston also credited as additional background vocalist for [[Death by Stereo]]'s third album ''[[Into the Valley of Death]]'' and [[Travis Barker]] & [[Yelawolf]]'s collaborative [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Psycho White]]''. In 2006 Aston has made extra performance in stop motion-animated, musical independent film directed by [[John Roecker]] "''[[Live Freaky! Die Freaky!]]''".

==Musical style and culture==
[[File:MC LARS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|MC Lars at the [[Vans Warped Tour]] 2013.]]
Originally releasing tracks under the name Lars Horris, and then MC Lars Horris, Nielsen eventually dropped Horris (which later became the name of his record label), becoming MC Lars.  Lars plays with a laptop and occasionally a punk rock band to back him up, which he refers to as "post-punk laptop rap". [[Sampling (music)|Samples]] from bands such as [[Supergrass]], Piebald, [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]], Fugazi, and Iggy Pop play a key role in MC Lars's music.  Hearts That Hate, whose song "Cry Tonight" is sampled in Lars' "Signing Emo", is a fictional group created by the rapper. The Grammy-nominated Texan band Bowling for Soup performed as Hearts That Hate when MC Lars has supported them on tour. A full version of "Cry Tonight" is available as a [[B-side]] to the UK "Signing Emo" single.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2005/03/curry/|title=Adam Curry Wants to Make You an iPod Radio Star|first=Annalee|last=Newitz|date=March 1, 2005|website=Wired.com}}</ref>

MC Lars has also shown an interest in using lyrics and song titles based on [[English literature|English]] and [[American literature]]. "Rapbeth" references [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', while "Mr. Raven" is inspired by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Raven]]".  "Ahab" is about the novel ''[[Moby Dick]]'' and "Hey There Ophelia" on ''This Gigantic Robot Kills'' retells the story of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]''.

The term "[[Generation Y|iGeneration]]", coined by Lars in 2003, was used to describe the generation born primarily in the mid-to-late 1980s, was used in his song of the same name and given out for free to [[Facebook]] users in August 2006 in conjunction with iTunes.  In early 2006, his song "Download This Song" was featured on the pop-culture [[CBC Radio]] show ''Definitely Not The Opera''.

==Intellectual property activism==
In 2006, he released the single "[[Download This Song]]", which entered the [[Australian Singles Chart]] at number 29, while working with the Canadian independent record label [[Nettwerk|Nettwerk Records]] to release ''[[The Graduate (MC Lars album)|The Graduate]]''. Following this release, Lars toured extensively throughout the US, then he toured UK and did shows in Japan,<ref name="Full Effect Magazine">{{cite news|url=http://www.fulleffectmagazine.com/node/136|title=Spotlight Artist: MC Lars|date=2006-03-16|access-date=2007-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423132452/http://www.fulleffectmagazine.com/node/136|archive-date=2006-04-23|publisher=Full Effect Magazine}}</ref> and Australia. Not long after the album was released on [[iTunes]], Lars received an [[e-mail]] from a 15-year-old fan Elisa Greubel on his web forum saying she identified with "Download This Song" since her family was one of many being sued by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. This led to Nettwerk executive [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]] and a team of major-label artists managed by Nettwerk to support the Greubels with their case.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thornton |first1=Stuart |title=Already ambitious MC Lars further expands his sound. |url=https://www.montereycountyweekly.com/entertainment/music/already-ambitious-mc-lars-further-expands-his-sound/article_5b2ca7f8-7cf4-5715-ac20-0b2895a74d59.html |publisher=Monterey County Herald}}</ref> MC Lars returned to the UK in October 2006.  

In April 2007, MC Lars and Nettwerk made the component tracks for his single "[[White Kids Aren't Hyphy]]" available for remix under a [[Creative Commons license|by-nc-sa]] [[Creative Commons]] license on the Jamglue online mixing site as a contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamglue.com/contests/mclars|title=Jamglue.com has shut down|website=Jamglue.com}}</ref>

==Carnegie Hall performance and TEDx Talks==
After releasing the "Edgar Allan Poe EP", MC Lars performed at [[Carnegie Hall]] as part of the [[Scholastic Art & Writing Awards]] National Ceremony.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baden |first1=Morgan |title=Video spotlight: MC Lars is "Never Afraid" when books are around! |url=https://oomscholasticblog.com/post/video-spotlight-mc-lars-never-afraid-when-books-are-around |website=Scholastic}}</ref> Subsequently, he delivered a [[TEDx talk]] at the [[University of Southern California]] on the ties between literature and rap, in collaboration with the [[Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ucYtOk_8Qo|title=The hip-hop of Shakespeare: MC Lars at TEDxUSC}}</ref>  He later gave another TEDx talk in Homer, Alaska.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOIppi_j5C4|title=Education Through Rap and Hip Hop- MC Lars - TEDxYouth@Homer}}</ref>

== Horris Records ==
Following 2004's [[the Laptop EP]], Lars continued to grow his [[independent record label]] Horris Records.  Horris served as an imprint of [[Nettwerk]] and [[Oglio Records|Oglio]] before becoming self-distributed.<ref name="hatchettv">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8-MjPyX1Ok  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/A8-MjPyX1Ok |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|title=MC Lars and Weerd Science interview Part 1 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=30 June 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In 2008, Horris signed a two-record distribution deal with Crappy Records, founded by [[Jaret Reddick]], from the American rock band [[Bowling For Soup]].<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Mc larsBang.jpg|thumb|right|MC Lars performing with Australian band Wherewolves at Bang! Nightclub in Melbourne, May 2009.]]
In 2008 and 2009, Lars worked with [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], [[Wheatus]], the Rondo Brothers, Nick Rowe and Mike Kennedy of [[Bloodsimple]], [[Daniel Dart]] of [[Time Again]], [[Pierre Bouvier]] of [[Simple Plan]], [[the MC Bat Commander]] of [[the Aquabats]], [[Suburban Legends]], [[Worm Quartet]], [[Gabe Saporta]] of [[Cobra Starship]], [[Brett Anderson (American musician)|Brett Anderson]] of [[the Donnas]], [[MC Frontalot]], [[Jesse Dangerously]], Jaret Reddick of [[Bowling for Soup]], Linus Dotson of [[Size 14]], [[Parry Gripp]] of [[Nerf Herder]], [[Jonathan Coulton]], Aesias Finale, Sebastian Reynolds, Joe Ragosta of [[Patent Pending (band)|Patent Pending]] and classical musician [[Walt Ribeiro]] to complete his album ''This Gigantic Robot Kills''.

In 2011, Horris signed [[Josh Eppard|Weerd Science]].<ref name="hatchettv" /> Having his own label allowed Lars to experiment creatively.<ref name="MC Lars Kickstarter Site">{{cite web|title=MC Lars Kickstarter Site|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/horrisrecords/mc-lars-lars-attacks|website=Kickstarter.com}}</ref>  ''[[Lars Attacks!]]'' was a return to basics, with less punk elements and more standard hip-hop stylings, funded by Kickstarter, featuring cameos from [[KRS-One]], [[Sage Francis]] and [[Mac Lethal]].<ref name="MC Lars Kickstarter Site"/>  MC Lars used Kickstarter to fund a "Greatest Hits" album on vinyl, which also included his "Edgar Allan Poe EP".<ref>{{cite web|title=MC Lars Kickstarter Site|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/horrisrecords/mc-lars-greatest-hits-on-vinyl-and-edgar-allan-poe|website=Kickstarter.com}}</ref> On November 6, 2015, Lars released [[the Zombie Dinosaur LP]], his fourth official album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mclars.bandcamp.com/album/the-zombie-dinosaur-lp-available-nov-6th|title=The Zombie Dinosaur LP - AVAILABLE NOV. 6th!|author=MC Lars|work=[[Bandcamp]]|access-date=30 September 2015}}</ref> After releasing various musical projects via [[Bandcamp]] and [[Patreon]] in the years that followed, Lars used [[Kickstarter]] to fund his fifth album “Blockchain Planet” in 2021. The name Horris Records is derived from a cartoon character Lars created in middle school which also served as the basis for Lars' original stage name, MC Lars Horris, named after a character from [[Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman]].<ref name=hatchettv/>

==Live accompaniment==
In May, MC Lars toured the UK on the third installment of the Good To Go Tour, making friends with [[Wheatus]] front man Brendan B. Brown.  In July Lars and Brown recorded new songs, two of which would later appear on [[This Gigantic Robot Kills]]. In November, Lars returned to the UK on tour with pop-punk band Last Letter Read who performed their own set and then on stage with Lars, debuting Lars' new song "Hey There Ophelia".

On stage, Lars has been joined by [[Wheatus]], [[Bowling for Soup]], [[Simple Plan]], [[the Matches]] and [[Failsafe (UK band)|Failsafe]].  While supporting [[Zebrahead]] in the UK and Europe in 2010, Ed Udhus, Greg Bergdorf and tour manager Bobby Conner joined Lars on stage. In 2019 MC Lars took to the stage with Newcastle-based unsigned alt rock outfit Ruled By Raptors as his backing band in the UK as part of his 10-year anniversary celebrations for This Gigantic Robot Kills. On the tour, MC Lars mentioned this was the first time that he had performed with a band without any form of backing track, instead relying on the band to recreate everything instrumentally or with samples and triggers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/mclars/posts/10155534736336650 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/11463491649/10155534736336650 |archive-date=2022-02-26 |url-access=limited|title=MC Lars|website=Facebook.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

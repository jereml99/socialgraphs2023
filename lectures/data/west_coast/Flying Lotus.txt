== Musical career ==
===2006–2007: Adult Swim, ''1983'' and Warp Records===
In 2006, while at his mother's house, Ellison saw an advertisement on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] programming block asking for song submissions. He sent some in, under the name Flying Lotus (a moniker inspired by [[lucid dreaming]]) and was accepted.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rnamk6/evolution-of-flying-lotus|title=The Evolution of Flying Lotus|last=Zadeh|first=Joe|date=September 26, 2014|access-date=July 30, 2019|magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]}}</ref>

Around this time, he was [[intern]]ing at the pioneering hip hop label [[Stones Throw Records]]. He released his debut studio album [[1983 (album)|''1983'']] on October 3, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9740-1983/|title=Pitchfork: Album Reviews: Flying Lotus: 1983 |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=January 10, 2007|access-date=July 30, 2019}}</ref>

In 2006, Ellison participated in that year's annual [[Red Bull Music Academy]], which took place in [[Melbourne, Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/about/alumni |title=Alumni: Melbourne 2006 |access-date=April 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418205543/http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/about/alumni |archive-date=April 18, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2007, he announced on CSU-Fullerton's Titan Radio that he signed with [[Warp Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugonemag.com/2007/02/24/flying-lotus-signs-with-warp |title=Flying Lotus signs with Warp &#124; Plug One |website=Plugonemag.com |date=February 24, 2007 |access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref> He released his debut [[Extended play|EP]], the six-track ''[[Reset (Flying Lotus album)|Reset]]'' on October 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/2qdp|title=Flying Lotus - Reset EP - Review|work=[[BBC]]|first=Sarah|last=Nyman|date=2007|access-date=July 30, 2019}}</ref> Soon afterwards, he became one of the label's cornerstone artists and released his second studio album, ''[[Los Angeles (Flying Lotus album)|Los Angeles]]'' on June 10, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/los-angeles-mw0000788516|title=Los Angeles – Flying Lotus|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 30, 2019|last=Lymangrover|first=Jason}}</ref>

===2008–2009: ''Los Angeles'' and Brainfeeder===
In 2008 Flying Lotus released ''[[Los Angeles (Flying Lotus album)|Los Angeles]]'', a 17-track album dedicated to his home city. Telling Quietus on the subject of [[J Dilla]]'s influence on his music: "I love Dilla and who knows where this beat thing would be without him."

2008 saw Ellison enter a stage of hyper-productivity, as he followed up the Los Angeles record with collaborative tracks with [[Samiyam]] and [[Gonjasufi]], a limited white label run of remixes ("[[Los Angeles (Flying Lotus album)|Camel]]", "[[Donuts (album)|Lightworks]]", [[R2-D2]] sound effects, "[[Madvillainy|Shadows of Tomorrow]]" and "[[Promiscuous (song)|Promiscuous]]") called Shhh!, and a series of LA inspired EPs. Each of the La EPs features remixes and unreleased tracks from his Los Angeles Album. The third in that series (titled L.A. EP 3 X 3), marked a new atmospheric style in his sound. The same year, Flying Lotus also remixed "Reckoner" from ''[[In Rainbows]],'' an album by [[Radiohead]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thiessen|first=Brock|title=Flying Lotus Preps Second LA EP|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/flying_lotus_preps_second_la_ep|publisher=[[Exclaim!

===2010–2011: ''Cosmogramma'' and collaborations===
His third studio album, ''[[Cosmogramma]]'', was released in the UK on May 3, 2010, and in the US on May 4, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cosmogramma |url=https://www.amazon.com/Cosmogramma-Flying-Lotus/dp/B003ATUFSK/ |title=Cosmogramma: Flying Lotus: Music |website=Amazon.com |access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref> In January 2011, ''Cosmogramma'' won in the Dance/Electronica Album category in the 10th Annual [[Independent Music Awards (IMAs)|Independent Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/imanominee/10th/Album/Dance-Electronica |title=Nominees : Album : Dance/Electronica |publisher=The Independent Music Awards |access-date=October 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012102342/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/imanominee/10th/album/dance-electronica |archive-date=October 12, 2012 }}</ref> The multi-award-winning [[Cosmogramma]] was a hard-hitting [[Afrofuturism|afrofuturistic]] shrine to soul, hip-hop, jazz and IDM but, with more emphasis on a lyrical message than ever before. The album was accompanied by live instrumentation ([[Thundercat (musician)|Thundercat]] on bass, [[Miguel Atwood-Ferguson]] on strings, Rebekah Raff on harp) and live vocalists ([[Thom Yorke]], [[Laura Darlington]]) – all picked to help communicate the spiritual musical lineage of Ellison's family ([[Ravi Coltrane]], himself, played tenor sax). Stephen Bruner, aka Thundercat, who is featured extensively on Cosmogramma, would later become a large part of future albums by Flying Lotus.

In 2010, Flying Lotus collaborated with the [[Ann Arbor Film Festival]] in the performance of a live scoring of the 1962 [[avant-garde]] film ''[[Heaven and Earth Magic]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aafilmfest.bside.com/2010/films/flyinglotusplaysheavenearthmagic_aafilmfest2010_aafilmfest2010 |title=Ann Arbor Film Festival 2010 : Flying Lotus plays Heaven & Earth Magic |website=Aafilmfest.bside.com |access-date=February 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708101624/http://aafilmfest.bside.com/2010/films/flyinglotusplaysheavenearthmagic_aafilmfest2010_aafilmfest2010 |archive-date=July 8, 2011 }}</ref> In a post-viewing interview with the audience, Flying Lotus said that he was unsure whether or not a recording of the performance (or a recreation of it) would be publicly released, but he would be enthusiastic towards similar projects in the future. He was chosen by [[Battles (band)|Battles]] to perform at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP Nightmare Before Christmas]] festival that it co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England, UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/nightmare2011.php |title=ATP Nightmare Before Christmas|website=Atpfestival.com|access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>

In September 2010, Flying Lotus released "[[Pattern+Grid World]]", an 8 track EP featuring Thundercat on bass & art by Theo Ellsworth. The Track ''Camera Day'' was used in the [[Killer Mike]] song ''Swimming'', which was released as part of the [[Adult Swim]] Singles Series.

In January 2011, Flying Lotus won the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards for his video "MmmHmm" in the Short-Form Video category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima/artist/flying-lotus |title=Flying Lotus |website=Independentmusicawards.com |access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>

It was reported in 2011 that Flying Lotus would be collaborating with R&B singer [[Erykah Badu]] on new material for her next album,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes |first=Josiah |url=http://exclaim.ca/News/flying_lotus_working_with_erykah_badu |title=Flying Lotus Collaborating with Erykah Badu • News |website=Exclaim.ca |date=April 12, 2011 |access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref> and planned to remix one of Radiohead's songs from ''[[The King of Limbs]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Josiah|title=Flying Lotus Planning Remix of Radiohead's 'King of Limbs'|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/flying_lotus_planning_remix_of_radioheads_king_of_limbs|publisher=[[Exclaim!

[[File:Flying Lotus, Bonnaroo 2012 (7373612680).jpg|thumb|Flying Lotus performing at the [[2012 Bonnaroo Music Festival]]]]

With an appreciation for hip hop, but no established work, artists like [[Odd Future]] (also aficionados of Adult Swim), [[ASAP Mob|A$AP Mob]], [[SpaceGhostPurrp|Spaceghostpurrp]] and [[Shabazz Palaces]] inspired him to directly participate, and he began production work for Odd Future's [[Hodgy Beats]]' [[Untitled Hodgy Beats EP|Untitled EP]]. This led to the moment in which he decided to produce more in the genre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/49132-flying-lotus-gives-first-interview-about-captain-murphy-working-on-new-material/|title = Flying Lotus Gives First Interview About Captain Murphy, Working on New Material|website = [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date = January 12, 2013}}</ref> Throughout the summer of 2012, Captain Murphy began to make more appearances, dressed in Luchadore Ensemble.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In August 2012, Flying Lotus announced a multimedia project with filmmaker [[Miwa Matreyek]], which is to be titled ''The Mapping of Countries Yet to Come''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Andrew|title=Flying Lotus Working On Multimedia Project, 'The Mapping Of Countries Yet To Come'|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/flying-lotus-working-on-multimedia-project-the-map/55545/|access-date=September 17, 2012}}</ref>

Flying Lotus produced rapper [[Mac Miller]]'s song "SDS'" for his album ''[[Watching Movies with the Sound Off]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=MAC MILLER – "S.D.S." P.

Behind closed doors, though, the work for his fourth album ''[[Until the Quiet Comes]]'' was pretty much done. A year prior, Ellison had worked with Ann Arbor Festival to live score a surreal and [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] 50s animation Heaven and Earth Magic, and a fascination with dreamlike states had continued into this record. Until The Quiet Comes continued his creative relationship with Radiohead's [[Thom Yorke]], as well as [[Jonny Greenwood]], Niki Randa, [[Erykah Badu]], [[Laura Darlington]] and, of course, Thundercat, and was cinematically captured in a short film by filmmaker [[Kahlil Joseph (filmmaker)|Kahlil Joseph]].

In late 2012, less than two months after the release of his last record, a website started circulating online: www.captainmurphy.xxx. Press speculated who the rapper was, with guessing being centered around the Odd Future Crew. The site hosted ''Duality'', a 34-minute short film mixtape, that comprised both new material and tracks that had been leaking all summer.

In April 2013, Flying Lotus announced that he has his own radio station called FlyLo FM in the [[video game]] ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', saying there would be "a ton of new songs and information, including rapping a new Captain Murphy song produced by [[Hudson Mohawke]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=GTA 5: Flying Lotus to Get His Own Radio Station|url=http://www.gameranx.com/updates/id/14237/article/gta-5-flying-lotus-to-get-his-own-radio-station/|website=Gameranx.com|date=April 24, 2013}}</ref> The radio station includes songs from [[Clams Casino (musician)|Clams Casino]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Hudson Mohawke]], [[Tyler, the Creator]], [[Dabrye]], Thundercat, [[Machinedrum]], [[Outkast]], [[DJ Rashad]] and [[Simon Neale|Shadow Child]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Flying Lotus Has A Grand Theft Auto Radio Station|url=https://www.redbull.com/us-en/flying-lotus-grand-theft-auto-radio-station|website=[[Red Bull]]|last=Sharp|first=Elliott|date=August 28, 2013|access-date=August 28, 2013}}</ref> In November 2014, Flying Lotus collaborated with [[MF DOOM]] on the track "Masquatch" for the reissued copy of the video game.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.stereogum.com/1720440/flying-lotus-masquatch-feat-doom/mp3s/|title = Flying Lotus – "Masquatch" (Feat.

'''Theresa Beth''' (born January 18, 1965),<ref name=Allmusic /> known professionally as '''Tairrie B''' (pronounced "Terry"), is an American rapper and singer. She first established herself as a rapper under the tutelage of [[Eazy-E]]. After releasing her debut album, ''[[Power of a Woman (Tairrie B album)|Power of a Woman]]'' (1990) on [[Ruthless Records]], she formed the [[rap metal]] band Manhole (later [[Tura Satana (band)|Tura Satana]]). She would further established herself in metal with the band [[My Ruin]]. Since 2015, she has primarily released rap albums.

==Career==
She started her music career as part of the female dance group [[Bardeux]]. After the release of their debut single, "Three-Time Lover", in 1987, she left the group. Under the tutelage of [[Eazy-E]], she was later signed to his label [[Ruthless Records]] (under a new imprint called Comptown Records) and released her first album, ''[[Power of a Woman (Tairrie B album)|Power of a Woman]]'', which, unlike usual Ruthless fare, was distributed by [[MCA Records]].<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tairrie-b-mn0000157953 |title=Tairrie B. – Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date=January 18, 1965 |access-date=February 20, 2013}}</ref> Tairrie B alleges she was assaulted by [[Dr. Dre]] at the 1990 [[Grammy Awards]] for not collaborating with him on her first album:

"Everyone with NWA – like [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]] and [[The D.O.C.]] – whenever they do an album, all of the guys appear on the last track. So they were going to do that with me at one point and Ice Cube was gonna write lyrics to a track called 'I Ain't Your Bitch'."{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} She refused, and rewrote the track as a diatribe against her labelmates. When Dr. Dre heard the track, he turned up at the awards ceremony party, where he punched Tairrie "twice – once in the mouth and once in the eye. He hit me like Tyson, but I took it – I don't know how."<ref>''[[Record Mirror]]'' – December 1, 1990 issue</ref>

It turned out to be the only Comptown Records album release. Tairrie B later began working on her second full-length album ''Single White Female'', but before releasing it decided to change her musical direction away from rap. After being released from her contract by Eazy-E, just a few weeks before his 1995 death, she then formed Manhole (later renamed [[Tura Satana (band)|Tura Satana]]),<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=333}}</ref> initially a [[rap metal]] band inspired by [[Ice-T]]'s band [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]].<ref name=Everley>{{cite web |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/tairrie-b-interview-manhole-tura-satana-my-ruin |title="The music industry is filled with liars, con artists and assholes": a no-bullsh*t interview with Tairrie B  |last=Everley |first=Dave |date=May 17, 2021 |work=Metal Hammer |access-date=2023-05-21}}</ref> She later formed [[My Ruin]]. In December 2008, Tairrie B married her long-time partner and guitarist of My Ruin, [[Mick Murphy (guitarist)|Mick Murphy]]. She stated in the band's [[Myspace]] blog that she had changed her last name to Murphy, but would continue to use the name Tairrie B in music.

In August 2015, Tairrie B returned to her rap roots with her third studio rap album ''[[Vintage Curses]]''. On October 30, 2015, cult director [[John Waters]] commented on Tairrie B's rap career and legacy in his interview with [[Iggy Pop]] on BBC Radio 6 just before playing "Ruthless Bitch" saying, "..she was very much a part of the story, she was the first white girl rapper I remember."<ref>{{Cite web|title = A Special Halloween Confidential with John Waters, Iggy Pop – BBC Radio 6 Music|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06khln6|website = BBC|access-date = November 15, 2015}}</ref>

On October 20, 2020, Tairrie B released a new album, ''Feminenergy'', with 12 songs that she described as "socially conscious, politically reflective, hardcore tracks of hip hop, rock & resistance."<ref name="Feminenergy, by TAIRRIE B">{{Cite web|title=Feminenergy, by TAIRRIE B|url=https://tairrieb.bandcamp.com/album/feminenergy|access-date=October 21, 2020|website=TAIRRIE B}}</ref> The album addresses racism, social injustice, sexism, and contains tributes to the passing of civil rights icon [[John Lewis]] and United States Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. The album features [[Mick Murphy (guitarist)|Mick Murphy]] (My Ruin), Paul Catten (Dead Sheeran, Barrabus, Murder One, Lazarus Blackstar, Medulla Nocte), and Spokane DJ, GrandMixer GMS (KFOX Nightbeat & Global Frequency).<ref name="Feminenergy, by TAIRRIE B"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Album Review: Tairrie B – Feminenergy|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-tairrie-b-feminenergy/|access-date=2021-08-01|website=Kerrang!|date=November 2020 }}</ref>

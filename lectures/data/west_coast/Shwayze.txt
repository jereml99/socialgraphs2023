==History==
===''Self-Titled'' album (2008)===

After recording several tracks with [[Cisco Adler]], the duo was signed to [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] and a self-titled album was produced. Adler helped with songwriting, production, and backup vocals. "[[Buzzin' (Shwayze song)|Buzzin']]" was released on August 19, 2008, as the first single off the album, which was entitled ''[[Shwayze (album)|Shwayze]]''.<ref>"Shwayze Biography", ''Ace Show Biz'', September 24, 2012.</ref> The single "[[Corona and Lime (song)|Corona and Lime]]" soon followed. "Buzzin'" shot up the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, reaching No. 46; "Corona and Lime" reached No. 23. The album debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard and sold 47,000 copies in its first week while receiving mixed reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044342/jonas-brothers-begin-second-week-at-no-1 |title=Jonas Brothers Begin Second Week At No. 1 |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=March 9, 2012}}</ref> Despite being all but ignored in the hip hop community, ''Buzzin''' gained its popularity in the pop world. It was featured in [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] commercials. The misadventures of Shwayze and Cisco Adler appeared to marketers as a successful advertising campaign.<ref name="nytimes.com">Caramanica, Jon. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/arts/music/10shwa.html "Multitasking to the Music: Texting, Kissing, Dancing"], ''The New York Times'', October 10, 2008.</ref> Shwayze and Adler were the focus of a [[reality television]] series on [[MTV]], '' [[Buzzin' (TV series)|Buzzin']]'', which debuted on July 23, 2008.

===''Let It Beat'' (2009)===

Their second studio album, ''Let It Beat'' was initially announced on February 4, 2009. The album's first single, "Get U Home", was released on June 28, 2009. After the lack of success from the reality TV series, ''Buzzin''' that accompanied the first album, Shwayze was hopeful that he would gain greater music credibility. Rather than being famous for "Buzzin'", both Shwayze and Cisco Adler wanted to become more of a career band.

Adler was quoted saying he wanted to make the sound "bigger" on ''Let It Beat'' than it had been on ''Shwayze'', their debut album. In an attempt to change the sound, the first single off the album, "Get U Home," has more of a rhythmic club feeling. "Crazy For You," a collaboration with the [[Ric Ocasek]] and [[Darryl Jenifer]], sounds more like a rock track, while "Heart and Soul," with [[Roy Bittan]], is a ballad. [[Snoop Dogg]] is also featured on "Livin' It Up" and the Knux is on "Dirty Little Girl".<ref>Graff, Gary.

===Music mix tapes (2008–2010)===
Shwayze and Cisco Adler released a mixtape, ''Rich Girls'', on November 24, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/buzzin/series.jhtml |title=Buzzin' |access-date=July 14, 2008  |year=2008 |work=MTV.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=In Brief |url=http://www.fresnobee.com/262/story/715438.html |work=The Fresno Bee |date=July 7, 2008 |access-date=July 15, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724143008/http://www.fresnobee.com/262/story/715438.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = July 24, 2008}}</ref>

On September 7, 2010, as Aaron Smith, Shwayze released ''Love Stoned'', a free mixtape. Shwayze promoted the mixtape throughout the summer.

Shwayze's song "Get U Home" was featured in the horror films, ''[[Sorority Row]]'' and ''[[Piranha 3D]]''.

In 2010, Shwayze was featured in a sketch on ''[[Nick Swardson's Pretend Time]]''.

===''The W's'' free mini-album (2011)===
In January 2011, Cisco Adler and Shwayze announced a new free "miniature album" ''The W's''.  The title is a reference to the song "High Together" from Shwayze's first album in which he says "I live by the W's: Weed, and Women". More info on the mini album was released during "Cisco's House", a weekly webcast from Cisco Adler on Justin.TV.

===Name clarification===
The name ''Shwayze'' had, up until August 30, 2011, been the name of the duo Aaron Smith and Cisco Adler. However, after some confusion and a change of attitude, the duo decided that ''Shwayze'' should refer to Smith, and the duo would be known as Shwayze & Cisco Adler.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Graff |first1=Gary |title=Shwayze & Cisco Adler Learning from Jimmy Buffett's Business Savvy |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/468558/shwayze-cisco-adler-learning-from-jimmy-buffetts-business-savvy |magazine=Billboard |access-date=August 11, 2018 |date=August 3, 2011}}</ref> This change in name was the precursor to the release of their third album ''Island in the Sun.'' The album was the first on their new label Bananabeat Records which was distributed by the Orchard.

===''Island in the Sun'' (2011)===
Shwayze and Cisco planned to release their third studio album, ''Island in the Sun'' in mid-2011. The album's single, "You Could Be My Girl" hits a similar vibe as several songs from their debut album, Shwayze, unlike "Let It Beat", which had a more club, mainstream vibe. The album was released on September 13, 2011, it included features from [[Kendrick Lamar]], Sophie Stern, Nikko Gray and Sky Blu of [[LMFAO (group)|LMFAO]].<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/island-in-sun-bonus-version/id457924215 "Island in the Sun – by Shwayze & Cisco]. iTunes.com. Retrieved September 13, 2011.</ref>

Leading up to the album, the duo established the [[web series|internet show]] ''Cisco's House'', as well as a weekly "Island on Web Concept", which they used to release new tracks. "Butterfly" and "You Could Be My Girl" were debuted on this special.

Adler was quoted saying that he hopes Bananabeat Records will launch a "lifestyle-based movement" that will form partnerships with [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]] and [[New Era Cap Company|New Era]]. He cited [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s empire and business model as an inspiration.<ref>Graff, Gary.

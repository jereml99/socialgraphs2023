His debut album, ''[[Domino (Domino album)|Domino]]'', spawned two major hits in the United States,<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p38455|pure_url=yes}} Domino] at [[Allmusic]]</ref> including the Top 10 hit "Getto Jam", which reached No. 7 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]]. Several further albums were released, and Domino continued to score hits on the R&B charts into the 2000s (decade).

In 1996, Domino appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation CD, ''[[America is Dying Slowly]]'', alongside [[Biz Markie]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], and [[Fat Joe]], among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as "a masterpiece" by the ''[[The Source|Source]]'' magazine. He also performed on many soundtracks, including ''[[The Show (1995 film)|The Show]]'', ''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]'', ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', ''[[Blankman]]'', ''[[Tales From the Hood]]'' and ''[[Spooky House]]''.

While his self-titled debut album was critically and commercially well-received, many were quick to point out that his style was similar to that of fellow Long Beach resident and up-and-coming Dr. Dre protégé, [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Doggy Dogg]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r173135|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( Domino > Overview )))|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=October 16, 2008}}</ref> Three years later, Domino released his second album, ''[[Physical Funk]]'', which failed to become as successful as its predecessor.  The video for title track "Physical Funk" was a No. 1 video on MTV but the album was delayed{{clarify|date=September 2011}} before its release due to Def Jam (Russell Simmons record label) dropping Outburst Records (the record label Domino was released on) before the album was released.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}
He is a born again Christian.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ogdomino.com/interview.html |title = Interview}}</ref>

'''Christopher Wong Won''' (May 29, 1964{{spaced ndash}}July 13, 2017), better known by his stage name '''Fresh Kid Ice''', was a [[Trinidadian and Tobagonian Americans|Trinidadian-American]] [[rapper]]. He was a co-founder of the rap group [[2 Live Crew]], appearing on all of the group's albums from 1985 to 1998. Wong Won was born and spent his early childhood in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], before emigrating to the United States. In his early twenties, Wong Won was in the [[United States Air Force]] and he co-founded [[2 Live Crew]] while he was stationed in California. Early 2 Live Crew singles gained so much traction in Florida that they relocated there. By 1986, the group released the single "Throw The 'D{{'"}}; it is now considered the blueprint of [[Miami bass]].

Later in 1986, 2 Live Crew released their debut album, ''[[The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are]].'' The album established the group's signature style of comical [[Pornography|sexually explicit]] lyrics. After a slew of successful releases the group met with considerable controversy as a [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida|U.S. district court]] ruled the album legally obscene. They were prosecuted, but all later acquitted. Wong Won is the only 2 Live Crew member to appear in the all their subsequent albums.

Wong Won was the first prominent [[Asian hip hop|Asian]] and [[Asian American hip hop|Asian American rapper]], releasing his first solo album, ''[[The Chinaman (album)|The Chinaman]]'', in 1992. In the 2000s, he continued touring and releasing singles with 2 Live Crew. Wong Won's last projects, before his death in 2017, were his autobiography ''My Rise 2 Fame'' (2015) and the compilation ''Breaking Glass Ceilings Volume 1'' (2017).

== Early life ==
Wong Won was born in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] on May 29, 1964. His family is of [[Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Chinese]] and [[Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Afro-Trinidadian]] ancestry, with his Asian heritage originating primarily in [[Hong Kong]]. Wong Won and his family were [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-10-10 |title=Chatting with The Chinaman: 2 Live Crew's Fresh Kid Ice On Being Trini + Miami Bass |url=https://www.largeup.com/2014/10/10/2-live-crews-fresh-kid-ice/ |access-date=2022-11-01 |website=LargeUp |language=en-US}}</ref>

According to Wong Won, he joined the [[United States Air Force]] in 1982, while stationed in [[March Air Reserve Base|March Air Force Base]] near [[Riverside, California]]. Wong Won met fellow Airmen Yuri Vielot (Amazing Vee) and David Hobbs ([[Mr. Mixx]]), with whom he formed the rap group [[2 Live Crew]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wong Won|first=Christopher "Fresh Kid Ice"|title="My Rise 2 Fame": The Tell All Autobiography of a Hip Hop Legend|publisher=Iconic Three Media Group|year=2015|pages=487–493|chapter=4.

In 1985, 2 Live Crew released the single "The Revelation", which became popular in Florida, so much so that they relocated to [[Miami]], minus Vielot who left the group, at the behest of local [[Tour promoter|concert promoter]] [[Luther Campbell]], after Wong Won and Hobbs were discharged from the Air Force.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-fresh-kid-ice-obit-20170713-story.html|title=2 Live Crew's 'Fresh Kid Ice,' pioneer for Asian rappers, dies at 53|last=Kennedy|first=Gerrick D.|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413225718/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-fresh-kid-ice-obit-20170713-story.html|archive-date=April 13, 2019|access-date=April 13, 2019}}</ref>

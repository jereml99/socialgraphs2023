==Biography==

===Before 2003: Early life and career beginnings===
Curtiss King grew up as a shy child, particularly while attending Curtiss Middle school, he found ways to combat his insecurities by listening to music and getting lost in 90s sitcoms; giving him his stage name Curtiss King.
From the beginning, with the help of a high school friend, [[YouTube]], and a library card, Curtiss King set out to teach himself how to produce, engineer and write his own records, edit his own videos, design his own album covers, script his own websites, and build his brand from the ground up.<ref name="Featured Musician: Curtiss King">[http://www.bangstyle.com/2012/03/curtiss-king-bangstyle-featured-musician/ Featured Musician: Curtiss King] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508015800/http://www.bangstyle.com/2012/03/curtiss-king-bangstyle-featured-musician/ |date=2012-05-08 }}</ref>

===2003–2008: ''Notorious Scholars'' and ''The Storm On Mars''===

Shortly after graduating High School in 2003, Curtiss began creating and circulating numerous mixtapes to his Cerritos college classmates. After joining Myspace in 2005, he began to gain local popularity for his self pressed projects. In 2007 his production demand got a huge boost when he got a placement on the [[Vans]] Downtown Showdown Skate DVD as well as TDE artist [[Ab-Soul (rapper)|Ab-Soul]]’s first project ''Longterm'' with the song “Watch Yo Lady" ft. K-Dot ([[Kendrick Lamar]]). Later that same year Curtiss King signed to Rocstarr Entertainment, an up-and-coming independent label run by producer [[Tae Beast]] and producer/engineer/songwriter Starr Lab based out of [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]. Under the imprint he released two well received street albums ''Notorious Scholars'' and ''The Storm On Mars'' which boasted features from Ab-Soul and Young Rook as well as production from Tae Beast. After a few years Curtiss and Rocstarr Entertainment parted ways, and once again he found himself having to grind it out alone.<ref name="Unsigned Hype: Curtiss King">[http://urbansteez.com/featured-artist/unsigned-hype-curtiss-king Unsigned Hype: Curtiss King] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422120830/http://urbansteez.com/featured-artist/unsigned-hype-curtiss-king |date=2012-04-22 }}</ref>

While working a part-time job, King soon began to attend [[Orange Coast College]] in [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]] where he eventually earned his Entry Level Marketing Certificate. Shortly after his collegiate accomplishments, he lost both of his grandparents to Cancer. Seeking a brand new start, Curtiss eventually moved to the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]] with his mother. From spitting acapellas at local poetry venues to entering beat contests, he made it a point to engage himself in this vibrant music scene.

===2009– 2010: Black Cloud Music, ''Snick @ Nite'' and ''Jet Pack On E''===

In 2009, he saw his fanbase and production demand skyrocketed after collaborating with and producing for highly acclaimed artist [[Noa James]] on his ''Sounds of A Monster'' and Ab-Soul’s ''Longterm 2''. Shortly after these collaborations, King’s work eventually caught the attention of engineer/producer/rapper Jynxx, who approached King about signing to his independent label, [[Black Cloud Music]]. Under the [[Black Cloud Music]] imprint Curtiss began to gain nationwide exposure as an artist with the release of projects such as ''Snick @ Nite'',<ref name="GUEST STAR: I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE IT A CORNY PROJECT WHERE I'M THE BLACK DOUGs">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sohh.com/2011/08/i_didnt_want_to_make_it_a_corny_project.html# |title=GUEST STAR: "I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE IT A CORNY PROJECT WHERE I'M THE BLACK DOUG" |access-date=2012-06-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120162406/http://www.sohh.com/2011/08/i_didnt_want_to_make_it_a_corny_project.html# |archive-date=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and ''Jet Pack On E''.<ref name="Ab-Soul - Longterm 2: Lifestyles Of The Broke & Almost Famous">[http://www.djbooth.net/index/mixtapes/entry/ab-soul-longterm-2/ Ab-Soul – Longterm 2: Lifestyles Of The Broke & Almost Famous]</ref>

In 2010, King’s production began to take on a world wide exposure when he was invited to compete in the [[Red Bull]] Big Tune Beat Battle. Curtiss would also see additional exposure when he scored his first major label placement on Glasses Malone and Mack 10’s album ''Money Music''.<ref name="Glasses Malone's Top Five Cash Money Albums

In late 2011, King was given the rare opportunity to produce for a live action video game trailer for the popular computer game [[APB: All Points Bulletin|"APB: Reloaded"]].<ref name="APB Reloaded Trailer Exclusive: Music by Chaundon & Curtiss King">[http://komboacreations.com/blog/2011/11/9/apb-reloaded-trailer-exclusive-music-by-chaundon-curtiss-kin.html APB Reloaded Trailer Exclusive: Music by Chaundon & Curtiss Kingy]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
 
After putting together a 97-day campaign to get on the lineup for the 2012 [[Paid Dues|Paid Dues Festival]], King was officially invited by hip hop artist [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]] to perform on the Dues Paid Stage at the festival, ending a successful campaign. Shortly after performing at [[Paid Dues]] in April 2012, King made more noise a month later after producing Ab-Soul's single, "A Rebellion", featuring Alori Joh, from his highly anticipated album ''[[Control System]]'', which went on to be number one on the [[iTunes]] Hip Hop Charts.<ref name="Producer-Emcee Curtiss King Takes A Minute To Chat About Music And Marijuana">[http://www.hailmaryjane.com/producer-emcee-curtiss-king-takes-a-minute-to-chat-about-music-and-marijuana/ Producer-Emcee Curtiss King Takes A Minute To Chat About Music And Marijuana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413133401/http://www.hailmaryjane.com/producer-emcee-curtiss-king-takes-a-minute-to-chat-about-music-and-marijuana/ |date=2012-04-13 }}</ref><ref name="SAN BERNARDINO: Paid Dues festival set for Saturday">[http://www.pe.com/iguide/music/music-headlines/20120404-san-bernardino-paid-dues-festival-set-for-saturday.ece SAN BERNARDINO: Paid Dues festival set for Saturday]</ref><ref name="Ab-Soul Control System Album Review">{{Cite web |url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/ab-soul-control-system/ |title=Ab-Soul Control System Album Review |access-date=2012-06-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530190804/http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/ab-soul-control-system |archive-date=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

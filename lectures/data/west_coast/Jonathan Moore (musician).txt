==Early life==
Moore grew up in the [[Columbia City, Seattle|Columbia City]] neighborhood of Seattle and attended [[Roosevelt High School (Seattle)|Roosevelt High School]]. After he graduated in 1987, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia to attend Morehouse College.<ref name=":8" /> Moore worked at Sevananda, a natural grocery store while he attended [[Morehouse College]]. When he moved back to Seattle after college in Atlanta, he rented a house in the Central District with his brother, designer Upendo Tookas (a.k.a. Negus I), and friend, DJ Kamikaze, who also changed the hip-hop game in Seattle.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/music/mohai-exhibit-celebrates-seattle-hip-hop/|title=MOHAI exhibit celebrates Seattle hip-hop|date=September 18, 2015|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
Moore, Tookas and Kamikaze began performing at [[Langston Hughes Performing Arts Center]] in the Central District as Source of Labor (SOL) in 1989.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/source-of-labor-mn0000001662|title=Source of Labor {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestranger.com/music/2017/02/01/24836598/why-should-i-give-a-fuck-about-the-ghetto-chilldren|title=Why Should I Give a Fuck About the Ghetto Chilldren?|work=The Stranger|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

SOL (with Derrick Brown (a.k.a. Vitamin D) replacing Kamikaze in 1997), began the music label, Jasiri Media Group, although Jasiri began as a collective in 1993.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /> Also in '93 more popular venues and clubs downtown were booked with [[grunge]] shows and [[Gangsta rap|gangster rap]] was big at that time, making it a challenge for SOL to gain footing.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" /> As Wordsayer, Moore was known for his politically conscious verse and life.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yUEAAAAMBAJ&q=word+sayer+source+of+labor&pg=PA176|title=Vibe|last=Group|first=Vibe Media|date=April 13, 2017|publisher=Vibe Media Group|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.kexp.org/2017/03/10/r-i-p-jonathan-moore/|title=R.I.P. Jonathan Moore|last=KEXP|website=The KEXP Blog|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref> SOL and Jasiri were the center of Seattle's second wave of hip hop in the early 90s, the first wave being Nastymix Recording artist [[Sir Mix-a-Lot|Sir-Mix-a-Lot]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/a-source-for-seattle-hiphop/Content?oid=16952|title=A Source for Seattle Hiphop|last=Mudede|first=Charles|website=The Stranger|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

Moore is credited with bringing hip-hop into the mainstream in Seattle and bringing notoriety to the city's hip hop scene.<ref name=":1" /> Not only did he move hip hop into downtown Seattle, but to help sustain his effort, he also began booking and promoting other nationally notable acts for the same downtown clubs. He brought such artists as [[The Roots]] in 1995, [[Blackalicious]] and [[Saul Williams]] (for whom Moore managed a national tour in 2001).<ref name=":4" />

Moore also fought for all-ages venues in Seattle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20001001&slug=4045571|title=Business {{!}} Hip-hop enthusiasts stage peaceful protest {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref> The Teen Dance Ordinance of the early 1990s required a venue have one million dollar liability insurance and hire two off duty police officers in order to put on a show, making it nearly impossible for under aged kids to see music live. Moore was part of the movement to overturn that law in part by hosting ''Sure Shot Sundays'' at a local café/laundromat where [[Macklemore]] first performed at age 15.<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/memories-of-moore/|title=Remembering Jonathan Moore {{!}} Seattle Weekly|date=March 15, 2017|work=Seattle Weekly|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/2013/03/5-classic-hip-hop-albums-according-macklemore-and-ryan-lewis/|title=5 Classic Hip-Hop Albums… According to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis|date=March 20, 2013|website=Vibe|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/03/10/25016258/a-brief-hiphop-history-of-the-now-late-great-jonathan-moore|title=A Brief Hiphop History of The (Now) Late, Great Jonathan Moore|work=The Stranger|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

Moore met [[I Self Devine|Chaka Mkali]] while visiting his alma mater and connected him to the scrappy and burgeoning Seattle hip-hop scene which led to national attention and touring groups for the city.<ref name=":0" /> In 2000 Source of Labor played a show with [[Mos Def]] and local groups, Black Anger and Beyond Reality for [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s birthday at the [[University of Washington]]'s Hub Ballroom co-hosted by Student Hip-Hop Organization of Washington (the SHOW).<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/up--coming/Content?oid=3007|title=Up & Coming|website=The Stranger|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyuw.com/article_98b7def5-dca8-5001-baf3-809f07fe8738.html|title=Sleepin' in Seattle|last=Daily|first=The|work=The Daily of the University of Washington|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

Source of Labor disbanded in 2004 to focus on individual projects. Moore continued managing other emerging artists to provide them what he missed when he was new to the scene.<ref name=":4" /> He managed many third wave Seattle hip hop groups such as [[THEESatisfaction]] and [[Shabazz Palaces]].<ref name=":7" />

[[KUBE (FM)|KUBE 93]], Seattles mainstream pop station featured Moore and DJ Hyphen co-hosting ''Sunday Night Sound Sessions.<ref name=":6" />''<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=http://theflvr.com/moore-than-words/|title=Moore than Words – The FLVR|date=March 27, 2017|work=The FLVR|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

Moore worked until the end of his life. He was working on the video for rapper [[Brother Ali]]'s "Own Light (What Hearts Are For)" in which Moore's sister, Jen, dances in celebration of his life (filmed the day after he passed away). The video is dedicated in his memory.<ref name=":5" />

==Personal life==
Moore taught creative writing at [[Franklin High School (Seattle)|Franklin High School]].<ref name=":2"/> Upendo Moore, his oldest son, whom he had with his ex partner in life and music, Erika Kylea White (MC Kylea of Beyond Reality), began following in his parents' musical footsteps at 18 months old, playing the drums, and at 4, onstage with the Roots.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kuow.org/post/making-seattle-beats-he-was-8-years-old|title=Making Seattle Beats Since He Was 8 Years Old|last=Charles|first=DioMari|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref> His younger son, Miles, he had with his ex partner, Caitlin Brower.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/03/09/25014099/seattle-hiphop-pioneer-jonathan-moore-dies-at-47|title=Seattle Hiphop Pioneer Jonathan Moore Dies at 47|work=The Stranger|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

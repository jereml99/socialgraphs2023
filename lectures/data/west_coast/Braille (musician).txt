'''Bryan "Braille" Winchester''' (born 1981) is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artist. He has been writing and recording hip-hop music since he was 13 years old. For a short time, Bryan and his family relocated to the [[Marlton, New Jersey|Marlton]] section of [[Evesham Township, New Jersey]] where he attended [[Eastern Regional High School]] in [[Voorhees Township, New Jersey|Voorhees Township]]. Fully focused on music, Bryan Winchester adopted the stage name Braille Brizzy and headed back to experience the Portland music scene. The MC originally named himself "Reflection" and released one very narrowly distributed demo under the name, but later changed it to Braille.

The concept behind the name Braille relates to "Helping People Understand the things they can't see."<ref>[http://www.jedidiahusa.com/music/suser/17 Name Reference at Jedidiah Community Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821073621/http://www.jedidiahusa.com/music/suser/17 |date=August 21, 2008 }}</ref> He has worked with a host of premier hip hop recording acts including his group Lightheaded, with rapper-producer [[Ohmega Watts]] and rapper Othello.

In 2012 Braille collaborated with Odd Thomas and Courtland Urbano to form the group [[Beautiful Eulogy]]. David Kincannon of Rapzilla stated, "This musical triumvirate is responsible for some of the most creative hip hop of the last few years, and ''[[Satellite Kite]]'' does nothing but add to that resume. From the concepts to the beats to the lyrics to the delivery, everything about this album is on point. There is a working relationship between these three men that is obvious by listening to this album. There is also a shared creative spirit that is obvious, and it's that creativity that makes ''Satellite Kite'' great."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/reviews/4625|title=Review - Beautiful Eulogy 'Satellite Kite'|author=David Kincannon|work=Rapzilla|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref>

'''Jerry Buddy Long Jr.''' (born March 10, 1971), better known by his stage name '''Kokane''', is an American rapper and singer best known for his distinctive vocal style and numerous [[guest appearance]]s,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.47208/title.kokane-says-hes-the-most-featured-artist-in-the-world-with-over-4k-collabs|title=Kokane Says He's "The Most Featured Artist In The World" With Over 4K Collabs|last=Eustice|first=Kyle|date=June 9, 2018|work=[[HipHopDX]]|access-date=September 9, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> such as on [[Snoop Dogg]]'s ''[[Tha Last Meal]]''.

==Early life==
Long Jr. was born on March 10, 1969, in [[the Bronx]], New York City, the son of [[Motown]] composer Jerry B. Long Sr. and singer Debra Long. His family soon relocated to [[Pomona, California]], where he would grow up surrounded by his father's work and later joined the gang 357 Gangster [[Crips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unitedgangs.com/357-crips/ |title=357 Crips (Pomona) |website=Unitedgangs.com |date=October 6, 2014 |access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref>

He started his career at [[Eazy-E]]'s [[Ruthless Records]] in 1989, co-writing songs for [[N.W.A]] and [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]], before releasing his first album, ''[[Addictive Hip Hop Muzick]]'', in 1991.

==Career==
He began his career as a vocalist in the mid-1980s before eventually signing to [[Eazy-E]]'s [[Ruthless Records]] label in late 1989. His debut album, ''[[Addictive Hip Hop Muzick]]'', was released in 1991, on which he was credited as "Who Am I?" to avoid infringing on laws which forbade the use of his usual moniker.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hiphopdx.com/videos/id.25578/title.kokane-dives-into-birth-of-90s-gangsta-rap-g-funk-in-first-episode-of-the-preview|title=Kokane Dives Into Birth Of '90s Gangsta Rap & G-Funk In First Episode Of "The Preview"|date=December 30, 2016|work=[[HipHopDX]]|access-date=September 9, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> His first solo single, "Nickel Slick Nigga", appeared on the [[Deep Cover (soundtrack)|''Deep Cover'' soundtrack]]. In addition to co-writing "[[Appetite for Destruction (song)|Appetite for Destruction]]" for [[N.W.A]]'s ''[[Niggaz4life]]'', Long also contributed to other West Coast [[gangsta rap]] albums such as [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]]'s ''[[Black Mafia Life]]''.

For his second album, 1994's ''[[Funk Upon a Rhyme]]'', Long drastically changed his style, incorporating a great deal of singing and an eccentric form of G-funk. He would leave Ruthless Records shortly after Eazy-E's death in 1995. He was supposed to be on [[Tupac Shakur]]'s ''One Nation'' collaboration album, alongside others, before Shakur's murder in 1996 cut plans for the album short. He continued to make guest appearances until releasing his third solo album through Eureka Records in 1999, entitled ''[[They Call Me Mr. Kane]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kokane-mn0000775626/biography|title=Kokane {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref>

It was on the Los Angeles [[posse cut]] "Some L.A. Niggaz", from [[Dr. Dre]]'s ''2001'' album, that Long's career found a second wind. While Long had been involved with [[West Coast hip hop]] since the dawn of gangsta rap, he had been unable to secure any substantial success for himself. This changed after his work on ''2001'', through which Long developed a relationship with [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Tha Eastsidaz]]. He soon became involved in [[Tha Eastsidaz (album)|Tha Eastsidaz' debut album]], and went on to play a significant role in the success of Snoop Dogg's ''[[Tha Last Meal]]''. Long spent the next few years signed to [[Doggy Style Records|Dogghouse Records]], working on ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Kane''.

He later signed with [[Entertainment One Music|Koch Records]], forming a new group, The Hood Mob, comprising himself and fellow rappers Cricet and Contraband. They released their only self-titled album ''[[The Hood Mob]]'' on July 3, 2006.

His eighth solo studio album, ''The Legend Continues'', peaked at number 196 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/kokane|title=Kokane|work=[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]|access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref>

Over the course of his career Long has worked with artists such as Above the Law, [[Bad Azz (rapper)|Bad Azz]], [[C-Bo]], [[Cypress Hill]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Doggy's Angels]], [[E-40]], Eazy-E, [[Goldie Loc]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Kurupt]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], [[Nipsey Hussle]], [[Roscoe (rapper)|Roscoe]], [[Brotha Lynch Hung]], Snoop Dogg, [[Spice 1]], [[Suga Free]], [[The Alchemist (musician)|Alchemist]], [[Big Tray Deee]], [[Too Short|Too $hort]], [[WC (rapper)|WC]], Weazel Loc, [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Ras Kass]], [[Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E.]], [[Ab-Soul]], [[Young Buck]], [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], [[Tony Yayo]] and many others.

== Personal life ==
Long married Alicia Long in 1991. The couple has eight children, including Aanisah C. Long, who is a singer signed to Bud E Boy Entertainment, a record label owned by Kokane.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kokane Videos|title=Kokane Presents – The 2k's Preview – Episode 2|date=February 19, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPSFyqscGsg |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/qPSFyqscGsg |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|access-date=September 9, 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

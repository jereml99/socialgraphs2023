'''Todd Anthony Shaw''' (born April 28, 1966),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790001/|title=Too $hort|website=IMDb.com}}</ref><ref name="starpulse1" /><ref name="allmusic1" /> better known by the stage name '''Too Short''' (stylized as '''Too $hort'''), is an American rapper and record producer. He became famous in the [[West Coast hip hop]] scene in the late 1980s, with lyrics often based on [[pimping]] and [[promiscuity]], but also drug culture and street survival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/hip-hop-media-training/too-short-mother-finding-dirty-rap-book-hip-210350674.html|title=Too Short On Mother Finding His Dirty Rap Book And "The Hip Hop Dance Experience" Video Game|date=November 8, 2012|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> This is respectively exemplified in his most popular songs "[[Blow the Whistle (song)|Blow the Whistle]]" and "[[The Ghetto (Too Short song)|The Ghetto]]".

A pioneer of [[West Coast hip hop]],<ref name="starpulse1" /><ref name="allmusic1" /><ref>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/couples_therapy/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=15722 "Couples Therapy: Cast: Todd "Too Short" Shaw And Monica Payne"]. VH1. Retrieved October 10, 2012.</ref> Shaw began recording in 1983, cultivating a large following in his native [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. In 1987, his fourth album ''[[Born to Mack]]'' attracted the attention of [[Jive Records]], who signed him and distributed the album nationally. His subsequent 1988 album ''[[Life Is...Too Short]]'' was highly successful, going double [[RIAA certification#List of certifications|platinum]], and he remained prominent into the 1990s.

== Early life ==
Shaw was born and raised in Los Angeles. In 1980, he and his family moved to Oakland. He was a drummer in the band at [[Fremont High School (Oakland, California)|Fremont High School]] in Oakland.<ref>{{cite news| first= Chip | last= Johnson | url= http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/johnson/article/Too-hort-singing-a-new-tune-2464821.php | title= Too $hort singing a new tune | work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date= December 26, 2006 }}</ref>

== Career ==
In the mid-1980s, Shaw along with a high school friend Freddy B, produced custom songs (called "special requests") locally on cassette for people in Oakland and the Bay Area. In 1983, Too Short started his solo career and released his debut album, ''[[Don't Stop Rappin']]'' on Oakland record label 75 Girls Records And Tapes which, along with four 12" releases, featured raw, simple drum beats from a [[LinnDrum]] [[drum machine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/51352-Too-Short|title=Too Short|website=Discogs.com}}</ref>  This was also one of the first hip hop records to use the word "[[bitch (insult)|bitch]]" – a word which became one of the rapper's trademarks and was the focus of subsequent raps such as "Ain't Nothin' but a Word to Me".

In the early 1990s, his self-produced beats came from mostly a [[TR-808]] and from mid-to-late 2000s, a [[TR-909]] was used. In 1985, Too Short and Freddie B. formed the label Dangerous Music to regionally distribute his music, and with others formed rap group [[the Dangerous Crew]].<ref name="amg">Bush, John. [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p132295|pure_url=yes}} Too Short – Biography]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved September 16, 2007.</ref> Dangerous Music became Short Records, and then Up All Nite Records. With his 1988 release, ''[[Life Is...Too Short]]'', he began using replayed established [[funk]] riffs (rather than samples) with his beats.

Subsequent work was primarily collaborative, including work with [[Tupac Shakur]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]], and [[Pimp C]]. One of his notable collaborations during this period was on the track "The World Is Filled..." on the Notorious B.I.G. album ''[[Life After Death]]''; he comes in on the third verse after Diddy and Biggie. Being featured on the album introduced him to a wider audience as well, due to his typical style contrasting greatly with the Mafioso theme of the album. He also appeared on TWDY's hit single "Player's Holiday" from their 1999 debut album ''[[Derty Werk]]''<ref>[{{AllMusic |class= song|id= t3234194| pure_url=yes}} TWDY – "Player's Holiday"], AllMusic.</ref> as well as the [[Priority Records]] compilation ''Nuthin but a Gangsta Party''.<ref>Wilson, MacKenzie. [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r487431|pure_url=yes}} "Nuthin' but a Gangsta Party" – Overview], AllMusic.</ref> After these appearances, he began working on his eleventh album, ''[[Can't Stay Away]]''.  The album included guest appearances by [[8Ball & MJG]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Sean Combs]], [[E-40]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Soopafly]], [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] and [[B-Legit]].<ref name="mtv.com">[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427330/19990629/puff_daddy.jhtml Too $hort Adds Puffy Track To Upcoming LP]. [[MTV]]: June 29, 1999.</ref>

Too Short relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1994, but he did not begin working with a more diverse variety of Southern artists until 2000, when he collaborated with [[Lil Jon]]. With the 1999 release of ''[[Can't Stay Away]]'', Too Short came out of retirement, continuing his sexually explicit, relaxed style of rap.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/cant-stay-away-mw0000602388|title=Can't Stay Away – Too $hort &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> New albums released 2000–2003 were ''[[You Nasty]]'' (2000), ''[[Chase the Cat]]'' (2001), ''[[What's My Favorite Word?]]'' (2002), and ''[[Married to the Game]]'' (2003).  These albums all charted fairly well, as they all were in the top 71 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], but they did not do as well as Too Short's earlier 1990s releases, as none of them reached the top 10.<ref name=autogenerated1>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p132295|pure_url=yes}} Too Short > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums]</ref>

For his next album, ''[[Blow the Whistle (album)|Blow the Whistle]]'' (2006), Too Short now took advantage of the new [[hyphy]] rap music that was emerging out of his original home base in Oakland. This saw somewhat of a resurgence for Too Short as it peaked at No. 14 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], much better than each of his previous three releases.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  However, his subsequent releases, such as 2007's ''[[Get Off the Stage]]'', have not been as successful. On October 7, 2008, Too Short was honored by VH1 at the fifth annual "Hip-Hop Honors" along with [[Cypress Hill]], [[De La Soul]], [[Slick Rick]] and [[Naughty By Nature]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1savethemusic.com/node/145 |title=Hip Hop Pioneers Honored |publisher=VH1 | work= Save The Music |date=August 12, 2008 |access-date= November 22, 2011}}</ref>

In 2009, Too Short recorded for [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Soopafly]], [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] and [[B-Legit]].<ref name="mtv.com" /> In 2011, the rapper was featured on [[Wiz Khalifa]]'s song "[[On My Level]]". He also collaborated in [[Snoop Dogg]]'s 2011 album, ''[[Doggumentary]]'' in the song "Take U Home" and on the [[50 Cent]] song "[[First Date (50 Cent song)|First Date]]". In 2012 Too Short along with [[E-40]] released two collaboration albums on the same day titled ''[[History: Mob Music]]'' and ''[[History: Function Music]]''. Both charted in the top 100 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. Too Short has said the best verse he has ever recorded is a verse for a song on [[Dr. Dre]]'s ''Detox'' called "Man's Best Friend (Pussy)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22178/title.too-short-says-his-greatest-verse-is-the-dr-dre-detox-sessions-talks-vh1-couples-therapy|title=Too Short Says His Greatest Verse Is The Dr. Dre "Detox" Sessions, Talks Vh1 "Couples Therapy" |date=December 11, 2012|work=HipHopDX|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref>

In 2013, it was announced he would collaborate with [[Lady Gaga]] on a song "Jewels n' Drugs" for her upcoming album ''[[Artpop]]''. Also featured on the song are [[T.I.]] and [[Twista]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1713411/lady-gaga-itunes-festival-performance.jhtml |title= Lady Gaga Raps, Rages And Shares Sex Dreams At iTunes Festival|website=Mtv.com|access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref>

==Music career==
Manuel started in the music industry through Alonzo Williams, a DJ and party promoter in the Los Angeles area.<ref name="Payback" /> Since his start in 1974, Williams, working under his brand name Disco Construction, earned the title "Grandmaster Lonzo."<ref name="Regional Guide" /> In 1979, Lonzo took over The Eve After Dark nightclub, about a quarter mile outside of Compton.<ref name="Regional Guide" />

Lonzo mentored Manuel, and they began working together.<ref name="Payback" /> In 1984, Lonzo formed the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru|Wreckin' Cru]], a social group of his nightclub's resident DJs.<ref name="Regional Guide" /> While working with the Cru, Manuel took on a DJ name, The Unknown DJ.<ref name="Payback" /> The Wreckin' Cru, which included [[DJ Yella]] and [[Dr. Dre]], soon gained a rapper, CLI-nTEL, and began recording the electro rap.<ref name="Regional Guide" />

After taking classes at [[Long Beach City College]] to further his abilities in electronic music and recording, Unknown launched Techno Hop Records.<ref name="Regional Guide" /> Since 1984, he produced or released such "techno hop" songs—fusions of electro [[funk]] and hip hop<ref name="Payback" />—as "Basstronic," "808 Beats," and "Let's Jam." He had also produced early tracks of [[Ice-T]], and then [[gangsta rap]]'s inaugural anthem, Ice-T's 1986 [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] "[[6 in the Mornin']]."<ref name="Regional Guide" /> Later, Unknown DJ produced for [[MC Eiht|MC Eiht's]] crew [[Compton's Most Wanted]]. Other artists include [[A.L.T.]], [[Brownside]], [[N.W.A]], [[Bobby Jimmy]], and [[King Tee]].

The Unknown DJ also figures, if tangentially, into the story of [[Death Row Records]], whose cofounder Dr. Dre is a Wreckin' Cru alumnus. Reportedly, Dre's colleague [[The D.O.C.]] had suggested naming the newly forming label Def Row.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/dead-man-rapping-6398155 |title=Dead man rapping |last=Corcoran|first=Michael |date=1996-01-25 |website=Dallas Observer |publisher= Dallas Observer, LP |access-date=2017-10-26 |quote="I'm the one who told Dre to change the name to Death Row," Curry says. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-making-of-the-chronic-2407719 |title=The Making of ''The Chronic'' |last=Westhoff |first=Ben |date=2012-11-19 |website=LA Weekly |publisher= LA Weekly, LP |access-date=2017-10-26 |quote=The name Death Row came from my partner, Unknown [DJ]. Initially, it was supposed to be Def Row, as in Def Jam. D-E-F. And Dre bought the name Def Row and changed the name. }}</ref> But, already owning the rights to that name, DJ Unknown would later explain that he had made the name for a potential record label to open under [[Morgan Creek Entertainment Group]].<ref>{{cite podcast| url=https://soundcloud.com/wcp-i/interview-unknown-dj-west-1| title=Interview unknown dj west coast pioneers 11 2008 part two| website=www.westcoastpioneers.com| publisher=SoundCloud| host=West Coast Pioneers| date=2008| time=40:00| access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref>  In July 1991, Unknown sold the rights to Dre's team, including [[Suge Knight]] at the forming label's helm. However, the team chose, by 1992, to name the label more bluntly.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Morris |first=Chris |date=1996-01-20 |title=Death Row Is Target of Suit By Former Partner, Rapper |page = 94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3g4EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22andre+manuel%22+%22def+row%22&pg=PA94 |magazine=Billboard |location=New York |publisher=Billboard Music Group |access-date=2017-10-26 }}</ref>

In 1998, a court in [[Böblingen]], near [[Stuttgart]], sentenced Coolio to six months probation and fined him $17,000 after convicting him of being an accessory to robbery and causing bodily injury after Coolio and his band members allegedly attempted [[shoplifting]] clothing worth $940 and then punched the store owner when he was caught.

'''Michael Kenji Shinoda''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ᵻ|ˈ|n|oʊ|d|ə}}; born February 11, 1977) is an American musician, singer, rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He co-founded the rock band [[Linkin Park]] in 1996 and is the band's co-lead vocalist, as well as rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, primary songwriter and producer. Shinoda later created a hip-hop-driven side project, [[Fort Minor]], in 2004. He has also served as a producer for tracks and albums by artists such as [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Styles of Beyond]] and [[the X-Ecutioners]].

Born in [[Panorama City, Los Angeles]], California, and raised in [[Agoura Hills, California|Agoura Hills]], Shinoda formed Xero, which later became Linkin Park, with two of his high school friends: [[Brad Delson]] and [[Rob Bourdon]] in 1996, later joined by [[Joe Hahn]], [[Dave Farrell]] and Mark Wakefield. [[Chester Bennington]] joined Linkin Park in 1999, replacing Wakefield as lead vocalist. The band later signed a record deal with Warner Bros Records.

Shinoda is also the co-founder of [[Machine Shop Records]], a California-based record label. Outside of music, Shinoda is an artist and graphic designer. He has painted several pieces of artwork, some of which have been featured in the [[Japanese American National Museum]]. In 2018, Shinoda released his debut solo album ''[[Post Traumatic]]'', which consists of 18 songs about his feelings following the death of his Linkin Park bandmate Bennington.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.kerrang.com/the-news/mike-shinoda-has-released-a-surprise-ep/|title = Mike Shinoda Has Released A Surprise EP|work = [[Kerrang!]]|date= January 25, 2018|access-date=May 24, 2018}}</ref>

Shinoda attended [[Agoura High School]] with future Linkin Park bandmates [[Brad Delson]] and [[Rob Bourdon]]. The three formed the band Xero, and began to make a more serious attempt to pursue a career in the music industry. After graduating high school, Shinoda enrolled in the [[Art Center College of Design]] of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] to study [[graphic design]] and [[illustration]].<ref name=allmusic /> He attended classes with DJ and [[turntablist]] [[Joseph Hahn]].<ref name=allmusic /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/6wqjj4/mike-shinoda-fort-minor-interview-2015-welcome|title=After Ten Years, Fort Minor Is Back, and Mike Shinoda Still Wants You to Remember the Name|date=June 23, 2015 |publisher=Noisey|access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref> While studying at the Art Center College of Design, he experienced a form of [[identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]]. Years later, he told an interviewer:

{{Blockquote|text=I think it was probably in college that I realized that there was a difference between Japanese and Japanese-American. That's important to realize. It's not the same thing and then eventually with Linkin Park, I toured in Japan. I've been there now I think four times. I remember the first time I went, how familiar it seemed, just getting out of the plane, it smelled like my aunt's house, in the airport, it smelled like Japan. I don't know if anybody else even noticed it but I walked out of the plane and thought this is definitely familiar to me, didn't even see anything yet. And then going to Tokyo, [[Osaka]], [[Kyoto]], [[Nagoya]], you just recognize things about the way people act, the small things that people do such as how you'll grab a piece of paper. There are things that are more obvious like taking somebody's business card with two hands. You don't do that in the States. When I saw somebody do that I went, "Oh yeah, my uncle always does that," you know. There are little things that culturally come from Japan but they also exist in Japanese American culture and it made me feel like the connection was there and I kind of hadn't realized how much of it was there.<ref name="roots"/>}}

Shinoda graduated in 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts in Illustration and obtained a job as a graphic designer.<ref name="allmusic" /><ref>{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Robinson|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/billrobinson/linkin-park-hitech-rocker_b_1951605.html|title=Linkin Park: Hi-Tech Rockers With a Good Rap|publisher=Huffingtonpost|date=May 12, 2013|access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref>

In 2004, Shinoda formed a [[side project]] called Fort Minor, which he used as an avenue to further showcase his hip-hop background.

It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things going on in the world right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://lptimes.com/news2008/aug/news08102008.html |title=The Excesses of Mike Shinoda |work=[[Rafu Shimpo]] |date=August 10, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202181716/http://www.rafu.com/en/2008/0809/feature.html |archive-date=February 2, 2009 |access-date=October 18, 2014 }}</ref>

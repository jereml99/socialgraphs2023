==Career==

=== 1980s ===
Anthony "Sir Jinx" Wheaton began his career in the mid-80s as a part of hip hop duo the Stereo Crew with fellow rapper [[Ice Cube]]. They were signed with [[Epic Records]] and released their debut single "She's a Skag" in 1986, which was produced by Wheaton's cousin [[Dr. Dre]] and Dre's [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]] bandmate [[Alonzo Williams]]. Poor single sales caused them to be soon dropped off of the label. Joined by fellow rapper [[K-Dee|Kid Disaster]], they were picked by Kru-Cut Records and changed the group's name to [[C.I.A. (band)|C.I.A.]] In 1987 the trio released their single "[[My Posse]]" and appeared on the cover of ''[[N.W.A. and the Posse]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cizmar|first=Martin|date=March 16, 2010|title=Sir Jinx: What Happened After N.W.A. and the Posse?|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/sir-jinx-what-happened-after-nwa-and-the-posse-6609026|url-status=live|access-date=February 19, 2021|website=[[Phoenix New Times]]}}</ref> Cube and Dre have been focused on forming [[N.W.A]], which led to disband the C.I.A. Wheaton produced fellow rapper [[Dazzie Dee]]'s first extended play ''Turn It Loose'', released in 1989.

=== 1990s ===
When Cube left N.W.A and [[Ruthless Records]] over a financial dispute, all the former C.I.A. members along with several other artists formed the Lench Mob posse on Cube's founded [[Lench Mob Records]] label. Wheaton and Cube in collaboration with [[Chilly Chill]] and New York-based [[hip hop production]] team [[The Bomb Squad]] produced Ice Cube's debut solo studio album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' and the follow-up ''[[Kill at Will]]'' EP, both released in 1990. Both these projects were certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Same year Wheaton produced "Ain't Nothin' but a Word to Me", the only song from [[Too Short]]'s [[Short Dog's in the House]] album that has a featured [[guest appearance]] (by Ice Cube).

In 1991, Wheaton produced a significant number of songs on [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]]'s ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]'', [[WC and the Maad Circle]]'s ''[[Ain't a Damn Thang Changed]]'', and Ice Cube's ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'', including NWA [[Diss (music)|diss track]] "[[No Vaseline]]". He also produced "How to Survive in South Central", a Cube's song from ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' [[Boyz n the Hood (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], and [[Tone Lōc]] "I Adore You". Continuing into 1992 with Cube's ''[[The Predator (Ice Cube album)|The Predator]]'' and [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]]'s 1992 ''[[Black Pearl (Yo-Yo album)|Black Pearl]]'', Wheaton stepped onto [[East Coast hip hop]] scene producing the majority of [[Kool G Rap]]'s final studio album with DJ Polo ''[[Live and Let Die (album)|Live and Let Die]]'', and also managed to provide additional production on two tracks for [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]'s son Trey Lewd's ''Drop the Line'', and to produce the title track for ''[[Trespass (soundtrack)|Music from the Motion Picture Trespass]]''. Sir Jinx created remixes for [[Rap rock|rap-rock]] outfits such as [[Rage Against the Machine]]'s "[[Guerrilla Radio]] (Sir Jinx Edit)", "[[Bullet in the Head (song)|Bullet in the Head]] (Sir Jinx Remix)", and the unreleased "[[Bombtrack]] (Remix)", all of which were recorded in 1992.

After producing a couple of tracks on Ice Cube's 1993 album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', Wheaton stopped working with Cube and his group [[Da Lench Mob]] due to their controversial direction.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Arnold|first=Paul|date=October 11, 2010|title=Sir Jinx Talks Ice Cube Reunion, Another Dr. Dre "Detox" Track With Jay-Z|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.12544/title.sir-jinx-talks-ice-cube-reunion-another-dr-dre-detox-track-with-jay-z|url-status=live|access-date=February 19, 2021|website=[[HipHopDX]]}}</ref> He moved on to producing for R&B-oriented solo acts such as [[CeCe Peniston]], [[Gerald Levert]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Teena Marie]], and former [[Bell Biv DeVoe]] member [[Ricky Bell (singer)|Ricky Bell]].

Following a low-profile independent solo album in 1995, Sir Jinx returned to hip hop production on Gooch's 1997 album ''A Lot on It'' and [[Xzibit]]'s 1998 album ''[[40 Dayz & 40 Nightz]]''. He also helped to produce skits on [[Tash (rapper)|Tash]]'s 1999 ''[[Rap Life]]'' and helped on Xzibit's 2000 ''[[Restless (Xzibit album)|Restless]]''.

=== 2000s ===
Wheaton provided production work on a song from comedian [[Eddie Griffin]]'s 2003 film ''[[Dysfunktional Family]]'' [[Dysfunktional Family (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. Same year he produced a couple of tracks on [[The Comrads]] member Gangsta album ''Penitentiary Chances'', as well as a [[posse cut]] on [[Westside Connection]]'s album ''[[Terrorist Threats]]''.

Outside of some minor production on [[Kurupt]]'s 2004 album ''Originals'' and 2005 album ''[[Against the Grain (Kurupt album)|Against the Grain]]'', Xzibit's 2004 album ''[[Weapons of Mass Destruction (album)|Weapons of Mass Destruction]]'', and [[Ras Kass]]'s 2009 project ''Quarterly'', Sir Jinx was relatively low-key during this period.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, Wheaton produced a song for [[Sadat X]]'s ''Wild Cowboys II'' album, as well as the track "Life in California" from Ice Cube's ''[[I Am the West]]'' album, which marked the first time Sir Jinx and Cube had worked together on any new material together in several years. In an October 2010 interview for [[HipHopDX]],<ref name=":0" /> Wheaton stated that he was going to help produce cousin Dr. Dre's [[development hell|long-awaited]] release ''[[Detox (Dr. Dre album)|Detox]]''. In spite of his relation to Dr. Dre, this is the first album the two have worked on together.

Sir Jinx collaborated with Tri Star and Dat Boi Hop to form General Population. The group released their album ''Sir Jinx Presents General Population: Rime Scene'' in 2011 featuring guest appearances from [[Butch Cassidy (singer)|Butch Cassidy]], [[Roscoe (rapper)|Roscoe]], [[Devin the Dude]], [[Jayo Felony]], Kurupt, Ras Kass. The following year, Jinx produced the entire Tri Star's project ''Trilogy''. Together with [[Mike & Keys]], Jinx produced debut [[Serial Killers (musical group)|Serial Killers]] single "First 48". In 2016, he and Dre produced T.I.'s non-album single "Dope", which featured vocals by [[Marsha Ambrosius]].

=== 2020s ===
Reports have surfaced that Sir Jinx is now suing Ice Cube for unpaid royalties.

===Film and television===
Sir Jinx has made appearances co-hosting [[BET]]'s [[Rap City]]: Tha Basement.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

He has also DJ'ed for various TV shows including ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and "The [[Orlando Jones]] Show".{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

In 1993, Sir Jinx had a cameo in [[John Singleton]]'s romantic drama film ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

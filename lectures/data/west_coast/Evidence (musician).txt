==Early life==
Evidence was born Michael Perretta on December 10, 1976 in [[Venice, Los Angeles]], [[California]] to Louis Michael Perretta, an [[Italian American]], and actress [[Jana Taylor]], who appeared in American television shows in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schindehette |first=Susan |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20119945,00.html |title=Jana Taylor Gives New Focus to the Lives of Inner-City Kids |publisher=People.com |access-date=2015-05-22}}</ref> Growing up he lived next to [[Quincy Jones III]]’s studio. He learned the ins and outs of recording and [[rapping|emceeing]] there.<ref>{{Cite web|title="people's party" podcast episode w/evidence|website = [[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4l6iXOrWdw |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211214/m4l6iXOrWdw |archive-date=2021-12-14 |url-status=live}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

==Music career==

===Dilated Peoples===
Shortly after meeting QD3, Evidence teamed with the like-minded [[Rakaa]] to form the group [[Dilated Peoples]] and after the success of their 1997 single "Third Degree" b/w "Confidence" and "Global Dynamics" on ABB Records – and the addition of DJ Babu to the fold a year later—the group quickly became a fixture on the hip hop tour circuit. They hoped their success would serve as a platform for solo projects, much as the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s success had done before them.

Four albums, and outside production work-including tracks for the [[Beastie Boys]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Swollen Members]], Defari, [[Planet Asia]] and co-production on [[Kanye West]]'s debut album ''[[The College Dropout]]'', which earned him a [[Grammy]], Evidence gave his fans a taste of his talent on his debut solo album, ''The Weatherman LP'' (ABB Records).

Evidence also made a track directed at [[Eminem]] called "Search 4 Bobby Fisher" during a feud.

Through his work as one-third of Dilated Peoples, Evidence became a champion of hip-hop culture. "This is for people who get what I do," says Evidence. "If I'm going to come out independently and have the freedom to do what I want, there's no better way to represent. I want to be a leader and carve out a new path."

===Solo work===
With production from [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], Sid Roams (producers Joey Chavez and Tavish "Bravo" Graham), [[Jake One]], [[DJ Babu]], [[DJ Khalil]], and Evidence himself, the album ''[[The Weatherman LP]]'' was released March 20, 2007.

Perretta was close with his mother; "I Still Love You" and "Chase The Clouds Away" are both tributes to her. She died due to cancer in 2004. Writing and performing "I Still Love You" was emotionally challenging for Evidence, a single child whose mother was his best friend and confidante. "I produced it, I rapped on it and I recorded it by myself with nobody in the room because I couldn't have anybody around when I was doing it," he explains. "It's the one time you're definitely going to get all of me."{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

On the release of ''The Weatherman LP'', Evidence said: "I am not relying on the success of Dilated Peoples to push this album, while they are featured on it and heavily co-signing my solo venture I understand that I am going to have to work twice as hard and get back in front of the people and re-introduce myself through shows, my music, and constant day-to-day networking with my fans. I am not married; I don't have kids, so I can stay on the road all year long if that is what it takes…so at the end of the day what I put in is what I get out and it will all be a reflection of me, Evidence."

Evidence is also planning to come out with an album with producer/rapper The Alchemist and are to be called the "Step Brothers".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}{{clarify|date=March 2018}}

On July 17, 2009 it was announced that Evidence had signed a deal with Minneapolis-based hip-hop label [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]], with a YouTube video showing Evidence signing the contract to release his next album.<ref>[http://www.rhymesayers.com/news.php#newsId_1797] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719153733/http://www.rhymesayers.com/news.php#newsId_1797|date=July 19, 2009}}</ref>

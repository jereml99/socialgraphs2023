== Career ==

=== 1999–2009: Career beginnings ===
Spears was discovered by [[Punch (rapper)|Terrance "Punch" Henderson]], co-president of [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] (TDE), when he was 13 years old.<ref name=":1" /> After meeting with rapper [[Bishop Lamont]], he produced a song for him using ''MTV Music Generator'', which later received radio placement.<ref name=":0" /> He graduated from [[Compton High School]] in 2005 and was gifted an [[Akai MPC]] by his cousin; it soon became one of his primary production tools.<ref name=":0" /> Spears first met rapper [[Kendrick Lamar]] in a recording studio in [[Gardena, California]]. Lamar was silent until Spears played a spin of [[Aalon]]'s 1977 song "Rock and Roll Gangster", which made him rush to the recording booth and rap for two minutes straight.<ref name=":1" />

One year later, Spears met TDE's founder and chief executive officer Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, who was originally unimpressed with him.

==Early life==
Ross was born in [[Rochester, New York]] on April 4, 1966. He and his mother moved from New York to [[Los Angeles, California]] when Ross was 14 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/2-live-crews-brother-marquis-on-new-album-turn-me-on-and-three-decades-of-dirty-rap-6483056|title=2 Live Crew's Brother Marquis on New Album, Turn Me On, and Three Decades of Dirty Rap|publisher=Miami New Times|last=Katel|first=Jacob|date=August 28, 2014}}</ref>

== Career ==
===1983–1986 Early career, joining 2 Live Crew and the group's breakthrough===
Ross released two [[twelve-inch single]]s, "Westside Storie" and "Rhythm Rock", during his [[high school]] years, as a member of the rap group, the Caution Crew, which also included the rappers [[Rodney-O & Joe Cooley|Rodney-O]] and C Funk. These two singles were among the first 12-inch [[West Coast hip hop|hip hop records from the West Coast]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/295590-The-Caution-Crew|title=The Caution Crew|website=discogs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-d0fqg5E5k&t=617s|title=Exclusive Interview with 2 Live Crew Brother Marquis & Fresh Kid Ice|publisher=thaarchivest|website=YouTube}}</ref>

While still residing in [[Southern California]], Ross performed small shows with [[2 Live Crew]], which, at that time, consisted of rappers [[Fresh Kid Ice]] (Christopher Wong Won), Amazing Vee (Yuri Vielot), and their [[Disk jockey|DJ]] [[Mr. Mixx]] (David Hobbs).  Hobbs noticed Ross' [[battle rap]] skills, and told Ross that if 2 Live Crew ever achieved success in the music business, Hobbs would call Ross to be a part of the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/07/mr-mixx-interview|title=2 Live Crew's DJ and Producer Mr. Mixx On the Roots of Miami Bass|publisher=Red Bull Music Academy Daily}}</ref> In 1985, after finding [[Underground hip hop|underground]] success in [[Miami]], 2 Live Crew relocated to the city at the behest of local [[Tour promoter|concert promoter]] [[Luther Campbell]], who would later join the group as producer, recording artist, and [[hype man]].

Shortly after the move to Miami, the artistic direction of 2 Live Crew changed from West Coast hip hop style rap to comical, sexually explicit lyrics, and rapper Vielot left the group.  In April, 1985, Hobbs made good on his previous promise to a then 19-year old Ross, and invited Ross to join 2 Live Crew with Wong Won, Hobbs and Campbell. The first 2 Live Crew single released with Ross was "Word".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2014/08/2-live-crew_interview_brother-marquis_miami_2014.php?page=2|title=2 2 Live Crew's Brother Marquis on New Album, Turn Me On, and Three Decades of Dirty Rap |last=Katel|first=Jacob|publisher=Miami New Times |date=2014-09-02 |access-date=2014-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/My-Rise-Fame-Autobiography-Legend-ebook/dp/B010NY9W06|title="My Rise 2 Fame": The Tell All Autobiography of a Hip Hop Legend|last=Wong Won|first=Christopher 'Fresh Kid Ice"|publisher=Iconic Three Media Group,LLC|date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>

The 2 Live Crew's [[Music recording certification|Gold-certified]] debut album, ''[[The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are]]'' (1986), exploded on the local scene. The expanding national popularity of ''The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are'' made Ross and his band mates rap superstars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=2+LIVE+CREW&ti=THE+2+LIVE+CREW+IS+WHAT+WE+ARE|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|work=[[RIAA]]|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=2+LIVE+CREW&ti=MOVE+SOMETHIN'|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|work=[[RIAA]]|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== 1988–1991: Best selling 2 Live Crew albums and attendant controversy ===
In 1988, [[2 Live Crew]] released their second [[studio album]], ''[[Move Somethin' (album)|Move Somethin']]''. The album was also certified Gold and featured the singles "Move Somethin'" and "Do Wah Diddy Diddy".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=2+LIVE+CREW&ti=MOVE+SOMETHIN'|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|work=[[RIAA]]|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Move Somethin''' improved on the charts from the previous album, making into #68 on the ''Billboard 200'' and #20 on the ''Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums'' charts.

2 Live Crew's third studio album ''[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]]'' (1989), became the group's biggest seller, certified as Double Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. In 1990, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]] ruled that the album was legally obscene;<ref>''Skyywalker Records, Inc. v. Navarro'', 739 F.Supp. 578 (S.D. Fla. 1990).</ref> but this ruling was later overturned by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]].<ref>''Luke Records, Inc. v. Navarro'', 960 F.2d 134 (11th Cir. 1992).</ref> ''As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' is the first album in history to be deemed legally obscene.<ref>Deflem, Mathieu. 2020. [https://deflem.blogspot.com/2019/07/music-censorship-labeling.html "Popular Culture and Social Control: The Moral Panic on Music Labeling."] ''American Journal of Criminal Justice'' 45(1):2-24 (First published online July 24, 2019).</ref>

In 1990, Ross and the [[2 Live Crew]] released their fourth album ''[[Banned in the U.S.A.]]'', which was originally credited as [[Luther Campbell|Campbell]]'s solo album featuring 2 Live Crew and in later editions credited as a 2 Live Crew album. The album included the hits "[[Do the Bart]]" and the title track. It was also the very first release to bear the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-standard [[Parental Advisory]] warning sticker.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schonfeld|first1=Zach|title=Does the Parental Advisory Label Still Matter?|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/does-parental-advisory-label-still-matter-tipper-gore-336329|website=[[Newsweek]]|access-date=24 July 2016}}</ref>  The [[eponym]]ous title single was a reference to the obscenity decision from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. [[Bruce Springsteen]] granted the group permission to [[Interpolation (popular music)|interpolate]] his song "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]" for the single.

Also in 1990, 2 Live Crew released ''Live in Concert'', the group’s only [[Album#Live|live album]], and their fifth album overall.  The album was released under the Effect label, a subsidiary label of [[Luke Records]]. The album peaked at #46 on the ''[[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]]'' chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-2-live-crew/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-albums/song/375159|title=The 2 Live Crew Live In Concert Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-04-03|archive-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511103724/https://www.billboard.com/music/the-2-live-crew/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-albums/song/375159|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''[[Sports Weekend: As Nasty as They Wanna Be, Pt. 2]]'', the fifth studio album and sixth album overall by the [[2 Live Crew]] was released in 1991 as a sequel of ''[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]]''.  A clean version was also released entitled ''Sports Weekend: As Clean As They Wanna Be Part II'' and was the sequel of ''[[As Clean As They Wanna Be]]''.  ''Sports Weekend: As Nasty as They Wanna Be, Pt. 2'' would be the final album released by the most well known line up 2 Live Crew members (Ross, Wong Won, Campbell and Hobbs).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/My-Rise-Fame-Autobiography-Legend-ebook/dp/B010NY9W06|title="My Rise 2 Fame": The Tell All Autobiography of a Hip Hop Legend|last=Wong Won|first=Christopher 'Fresh Kid Ice"|publisher=Iconic Three Media Group,LLC|date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>

=== 1992–2003: Subsequent 2 Live Crew success, featured rapper and solo project ===
In 1993, Ross and [[DJ Toomp]] formed a duo group named 2 Nazty and released one studio album, ''Indecent Exposure''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/499885-II-Nazty|title=2 Nazty|website=Discogs}}</ref> That same year, Ross appeared as a featured rapper on [[Ice-T]]'s album ''[[Home Invasion (album)|Home Invasion]]'' by [[Ice-T]] on the original version of "[[99 Problems]]", which was later remade into a major hit by [[Jay-Z]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/complete-history-99-problems-jay-z-ice-t.html|last=Jung|first=E. Alex|title=The 21-Year History of the Song '99 Problems'|website=Vulture}}</ref> Ross filed a lawsuit against Jay-Z and Ice-T over the "99 Problems" remake. Ross claimed that he was paid just $10,000 in royalties, despite being prominently featured on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://allhiphop.com/2005/11/15/2-live-crew-member-files-lawsuit-against-jay-z-ice-t-over-99-problems/|last=Strong|first=Nolan|title=2 Live Crew Member Files Lawsuit Against Jay-Z & Ice-T Over '99 Problems'|website=All Hip Hop}}</ref>

In 1994, [[Luther Campbell|Campbell]], [[Fresh Kid Ice|Wong Won]], and a local [[Miami]] rapper named Verb made an album called ''[[Back at Your Ass for the Nine-4]]'', as The New 2 Live Crew, without the involvement of Ross or [[Mr. Mixx|Hobbs]]. ''Back at Your Ass for the Nine-4'' is the last 2 Live Crew-related project to feature [[Luther Campbell|Campbell]], and the only album released without Ross.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/back-at-your-ass-for-the-nine-4-mw0000109738|title=The 2 Live Crew Back at Your Ass for the Nine-4|last=Thurston|first=Jason|website=AllMusic}}</ref>

Ross, Wong Won and Hobbs would reunite to release the single "Hoochie Mama" for the soundtrack to the 1995 movie ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]''. The soundtrack reached #1 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' chart, where it held its position for two weeks, and on the ''[[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]]'' chart for six weeks.

In 1996, Ross reunited with [[Fresh Kid Ice|Wong Won]] and [[Mr. Mixx|Hobbs]] under the [[2 Live Crew]] banner to release the group's seventh studio album ''[[Shake a Lil' Somethin']]'', whose eponymous single peaked at #11 on the ''[[Hot Rap Songs|Hot Rap Singles]]'' chart,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/music/the-2-live-crew/chart-history/rap-song/song/45664|title=The 2 Live Crew Shake A Lil' Somethin'...

In 1998, Ross, along with Wong Won, released ''[[The Real One]]'' the final [[2 Live Crew]] album to date.

===2006–2010: Reforming and reuniting with 2 Live Crew===

During 2006–07 Ross and [[Fresh Kid Ice|Wong Won]] met, discussed their differences, and ultimately decided to relaunch [[2 Live Crew]]. The duo made offers to past members (notably, Hobbs and Campbell) to re-join the group, but the offers were declined. Prior to [[Fresh Kid Ice#Death|Wong Won's death in 2017]], the duo toured and released singles.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/My-Rise-Fame-Autobiography-Legend-ebook/dp/B010NY9W06|title="My Rise 2 Fame": The Tell All Autobiography of a Hip Hop Legend|last=Wong Won|first=Christopher 'Fresh Kid Ice"|publisher=Iconic Three Media Group, LLC|date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>

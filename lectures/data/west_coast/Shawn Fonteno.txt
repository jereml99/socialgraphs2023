In 2021, Fonteno and fellow ''Grand Theft Auto V'' actor [[Slink Johnson]] reprised their roles as Franklin Clinton and Lamar Davis respectively in a live-action re-enactment of a cutscene in the game where Lamar mocks Franklin for his haircut. The scene experienced a resurgence in popularity in late 2020 when parodies of the cutscene were uploaded on [[YouTube]] and other video hosting sites, usually involving Lamar's character model being replaced with various popular culture icons such as [[Darth Vader]], [[Vegeta]] and [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] among others.<ref name="reenactment">{{Cite news |last=Good |first=Owen S. |date=2021-01-13 |title=GTA 5's 'Lamar roasts Franklin' meme goes IRL with original actors |language=en |url=https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/13/22228982/gta-5-lamar-roasts-franklin-original-actors-video |access-date=2021-01-23}}</ref><ref name="cnet">{{Cite news |last=Boom |first=Daniel Van |title=GTA V's dumbest meme re-created IRL with the game's actual actors |language=en |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/gta-vs-dumbest-meme-recreated-irl-with-the-games-actual-actors/ |access-date=2021-01-23}}</ref> Later that year, Fonteno and Johnson once again reprised their roles in ''The Contract'' DLC for ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'', which featured an homage to the original cutscene.<ref name="gtacontract">{{Cite news |title=Lamar roasts Franklin again in GTA Online's The Contract update |language=en-GB |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/grand-theft-auto-v/franklin-mission |access-date=2022-01-06}}</ref>

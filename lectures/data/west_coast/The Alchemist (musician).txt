'''Alan Daniel Maman''' (born October 25, 1977), professionally known as '''the Alchemist''', is an American record producer, DJ, rapper and songwriter.<ref name="Brown">Brown, Marisa "[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p297612/biography|pure_url=yes}} The Alchemist Biography]", [[Allmusic]], [[Macrovision Corporation]]</ref> He began his music career in 1991 in the hip hop duo [[the Whooliganz]] under the moniker Mudfoot, along with now-actor [[Scott Caan]]. He has produced music since the 1990s.

Together with collaborators [[Oh No (musician)|Oh No]] (with whom he forms the group [[Gangrene (group)|Gangrene]]), [[Woody Jackson]] and [[Tangerine Dream]] he composed the official [[sheet music|score]] to the 2013 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and hosts the radio station "The Lab" in it.

== Career ==
=== 1991–2003: Early career, the Whooliganz and Soul Assassins ===
The Alchemist hails from Beverly Hills, California. As a teenager, he began to identify strongly with the rebellious lyrics and urban sounds of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and he began writing his own lyrics. He joined up with other like-minded artists who wrote lyrics and rebelled against their suburban surroundings. These included [[Evidence (musician)|Evidence]] and [[Scott Caan]], son of [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]].<ref name="Brown" />

In 1991, a 14-year-old Maman and Scott Caan decided to become a duo named [[the Whooliganz]].<ref name="Brown" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/thealchemist|title=The Alchemist|work=Myspace|access-date=March 14, 2016}}</ref> While rhyming at a party in Los Angeles, they attracted the attention of [[B-Real]] of [[Cypress Hill]]. He invited the teens to join his crew, [[Soul Assassins]], which also included the groups [[House of Pain]] and [[Funkdoobiest]].<ref name="Brown" />

In 1993, the Whooliganz released their first single, "Put Your Handz Up". The song received little radio airplay and their record label, [[Tommy Boy Records]], decided to shelve their album.<ref name="Brown" /> Rejected, Scott focused his creative energy on acting while Al became interested in process of making hip hop beats.

[[DJ Muggs]] took Al under his wing and taught him how to use a [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] and [[mixing board]].<ref name="Brown" /> After helping to produce a few tracks for Cypress Hill, Al became the main producer for his childhood friend Evidence and his group [[Dilated Peoples]].

When Dilated Peoples debuted in 1998, it helped promote Maman as a key part of its sound. The Alchemist also produced several tracks on Defari's debut album ''Focused Daily'', another Dilated Peoples and [[tha Alkaholiks]] affiliate. In 1999, Muggs introduced Al to his good friends the popular hip hop group [[Mobb Deep]]. Al produced two songs for its ''[[Murda Muzik]]'' album.<ref name="Brown" /> Impressed by his production skills and [[Know-how|street smarts]], Mobb Deep continued using his beats on all of the group's subsequent albums. As the Alchemist's profile increased, he went on to produce for many of hip hop's most successful and prominent artists, such as [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Ghostface Killah]], and [[Snoop Dogg]].<ref name="Brown" /> He has also [[remix]]ed songs for bands and artists in other genres such as [[Linkin Park]] and [[Morcheeba]].<ref name="Brown" />

In 1999, the Alchemist was set to produce three tracks for American rapper [[Ras Kass]]' then-upcoming album ''Van Gogh'', which was scheduled for a late 2000 release at the time. One of the said tracks was "Home Sweet Home", which was to be the lead single for Ras Kass' album. After the Alchemist received the first half of the payment for the beat, he said Ras Kass' record label [[Priority Records|Priority]] was ignoring him. They later met up in August, at the [[Source Awards]] in Pasadena, California, where the Alchemist informed Kass that he'd been showcasing the beat to other artists. [[Jadakiss]] would then go on to record "[[We Gonna Make It]]" over the same beat, on his 2001 release, ''[[Kiss tha Game Goodbye]]''. When Ras Kass took notice, he attempted to stop the release by releasing his version of the song on mixtapes, to no avail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443801/20010516/alchemist_1_.jhtml|title=Alchemist Responds To Claims Of Double Dealing|work=MTV News|access-date=March 14, 2016}}</ref> This prompted Ras to diss the Alchemist in freestyles and on a track from ''Van Gogh''. Eventually, the beef ended so he could concentrate on his legal problems but still cited a loss of respect for the producer. In an interview with www.hiphopgame.com, Ras admitted that he was being stubborn and refused to listen to what the Alchemist was trying to tell him. The two have since squashed the beef and the Alchemist produced the song "Past, Future and Present" and did the intro for the song that appeared on the 2006 mixtape ''Revenge of the Spit''.

=== 2004–2008: ''1st Infantry'' and Shady Records ===
In 2004, six years after his rapping career folded, the Alchemist put out his debut album, ''[[1st Infantry (album)|1st Infantry]].'' The album yielded the single "[[Hold You Down (The Alchemist song)|Hold You Down]]", featuring [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]], Illa Ghee and [[Nina Sky]], which hit number ninety-five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 2005.

Since [[DJ Green Lantern]] departed from [[Shady Records]] in 2005 because of a dispute related to the feud of [[50 Cent]] and Jadakiss, the Alchemist is [[Eminem]]'s official DJ.

On July 13, 2005, the tour bus carrying Eminem's entourage, including rapper [[Stat Quo]] as well as the Alchemist, swerved off the road and turned over. The Alchemist was treated for broken [[ribs]] and a [[pneumothorax|collapsed lung]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1505729/07142005/stat_quo.jhtml|title=Anger Management Tour Bus Crashes; Stat Quo, Eminem's DJ Among Those Injured - News - VH1.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=vh1.com|access-date=March 16, 2018}}</ref>

In 2006, Eminem released a collaboration album with Shady Records called ''[[Eminem Presents: The Re-Up]]''. The Alchemist produced some of the tracks on the mixtape, as well as compiling the album in a mixtape fashion.

In 2007, the Alchemist and Prodigy came together for a studio album titled ''[[Return of the Mac]]'', that was released on March 27, 2007. It debuted at number thirty-two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 27,000 copies in its first week.<ref>Katie Hasty, [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053163/mcgraw-leads-seven-top-10-debuts-onto-billboard-200 "McGraw Leads Seven Top 10 Debuts Onto Billboard 200"], Billboard.com, April 4, 2007.</ref> As of December 2007, the album has sold 130,000 copies.<ref>Sanneh, Kelefa (December 30, 2007).

In an interview for Dead End Hip-Hop, the Alchemist stated that he had been working on a project related to the gospel. Later, on March 2, 2014, he posted a teaser photo to ''The Good Book'', which will be a collaboration between the Alchemist and producer Budgie, and also retweeted a tweet from Frank the Butcher, the founder of BAU, which the project is going to be released on, announcing the project and saying that more information will be released two days after.

Later, on March 5, they announced that the project is named '' The Good Book'', and released the first single "In Heaven's Home", featuring [[Roc Marciano]] and Prodigy. It comes in a well-designed cover in a shape of a bible book, covered in leather, and will be limited to one thousand. It released on March 11. The project includes mostly instrumentals and also some raps featuring Prodigy, Roc Marciano, Action Bronson, Domo Genesis and [[Blu (rapper)|Blu]].

=== 2015–present: ''Craft Singles'' and collaborative albums ===
On March 6, 2015, a while after Rockstar Games announced the release of the PC version of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', it was announced that the Alchemist and Oh No would have a new radio station called The Lab in the game. In addition to that, a new song "Play It Cool", featuring [[Earl Sweatshirt]] and Samuel Herring, was released. The song is apart from a new album of tracks inspired by ''GTA V'' named ''[[Welcome to Los Santos]]'' that was released on April 21, 2015.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/03/play-it-cool-welcome-to-los-santos|title=Future Islands, Earl Sweatshirt, The Alchemist and Oh No Team for "Play It Cool"|author=Kia Makarechi|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=March 6, 2015|access-date=March 14, 2016}}</ref> The album is a compilation album of new songs from a wide range of artists. The Alchemist and Oh No were involved in the production of the songs, and the album was released for the release of the PC version of the game.

On November 18, the Alchemist released a single on his SoundCloud, featuring [[Mac Miller]] and [[Migos]], titled "Jabroni". Later he said on Twitter that it would be released on limited 45 vinyl single with an instrumental version, as part of a new single series, called ''Craft Singles''. On February 11, the Alchemist announced the dates of release of every one of the four ''Craft Singles'' vinyls. The tracks were: "Hoover Street (Original Version)" by [[Schoolboy Q]] (March 11, 2016), "Any Means" and "Supply" by MC Eiht and Spice One (April 8), "Cobb" and "Palisades" by Blu (May 6) and "Jabroni" (June 3). Some of those were already released online and the Alchemist released the "Hoover Street (Original Version)" online on the same day of the announcements. On August 11, another song was released: "All for It" by Roc Marciano.

On January 13, 2016, the Alchemist and [[Currensy|Curren$y]] announced their second collaboration, titled ''[[The Carrollton Heist]]''.

This second collaboration of the Alchemist and Curren$y was very long-awaited since rumors of a ''[[Covert Coup]]'' sequel were floating online back in 2012 until the Alchemist dismissed them in an interview. The mixtape was, indeed released on February 14, on DatPiff. Later, the Alchemist noticed that the version there was not the final mastered one, so he uploaded the full mastered version to his SoundCloud page.

On March 2, 2016, [[Havoc (musician)|Havoc]] posted a photo on his Instagram stating that his next album is produced by the Alchemist, and is coming soon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/BCcLJi-SOgk |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/s/instagram/BCcLJi-SOgk |archive-date=December 26, 2021 |url-access=registration|title=Instagram|access-date=March 14, 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The title was revealed to be ''The Silent Partner'' and the first single, "Maintain", was released later. The album was released on May 20.

In December 2016, mixer Eddie Sancho revealed that he was mixing a joint project by the Alchemist and rapper Jay Worthy. Much later, in April 2017, the Alchemist revealed the name and June 2 release date of the project, titled ''Fantasy Island EP''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/04/jay-worthy-alchemist-fantasty-island-ep|title=Jay Worthy and Alchemist Share Release Date for 'Fantasy Island' EP|website=XXL Mag|date=April 25, 2017 |access-date=March 16, 2018}}</ref>

The Alchemist teased the sequel to ''The Good Book'' project with producer Budgie on his Instagram Story a couple of times. Then, on May 7, 2017, he surprisingly tweeted a link to pre-order the project and a first single, "Brother Jedediah", featuring Action Bronson and Big Body Bess. The project was released on July 21. Like the previous ''Good Book'', it contains two parts, one by the Alchemist and one by Budgie. The Alchemist's part features lyrics from Mobb Deep, [[Westside Gunn]], [[Conway the Machine]], [[Royce da 5'9"]], Action Bronson and more, as well as beats and some audio collages.

''[[Fetti]]'', a collaboration EP with Curren$y and [[Freddie Gibbs]], was first announced on January 4, 2017, through an Instagram post by Curren$y.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BO2vQf0jPnM/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/s/instagram/BO2vQf0jPnM |archive-date=December 26, 2021 |url-access=registration|title=@spitta_andretti on Instagram: "Called my homie Gibbs and told him it's time lets put the EP together...

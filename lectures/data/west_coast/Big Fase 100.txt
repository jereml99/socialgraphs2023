== Career ==
Around 2002, while The Game was signed to [[JT the Bigga Figga]]'s [[Get Low Recordz]], both brothers founded their own [[record label]] called [[The Black Wall Street Records]]. The name is adopted from what was the racially segregated [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood]]. During the oil boom of the [[Roaring Twenties|1920s]], Greenwood was home to several successful and prominent African-American entrepreneurs. The label featured artists, Djs and producers such as [[DJ Skee]], [[Techniec]] and a few others. Though the company never released any official retail albums, the label had released several mixtapes. In 2005, Big Fase 100 decided to leave Black Wall Street after a dispute with his brother The Game. After his departure from Black Wall Street, Taylor started his solo career as a rapper/producer and started his own label, Brazil Street Records, and One Hunned Entertainment, working with independent artists in the West Coast Hip Hop scene.

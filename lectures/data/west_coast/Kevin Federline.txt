On October 1, 2007, a court ruling granted Federline sole physical custody of his children, with legal custody to be decided. On the late evening of January 3, 2008, police were called to Spears' home after the singer reportedly refused to relinquish custody of her children to Federline and locked herself in a room with her younger son, Jayden.<ref name="hospital">[https://people.com/celebrity/britney-spears-hospitalized-for-an-evaluation/ Britney Spears Hospitalized for 'An Evaluation']; ''People''; January 4, 2008</ref> Spears was taken from her home on a stretcher and hospitalized at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] for appearing to be under the influence of an unknown substance.<ref name="hospital" /> As a result of this, Federline was "awarded sole legal custody and sole physical custody of the minor children".<ref name="custody" />

On July 26, 2008, court papers were filed stating Federline would retain sole legal and physical custody of the children while Spears would get visitation rights that would increase over time. In addition to this, Federline will receive $20,000 per month from Spears in [[child support]] as well as additional funds to cover any custody-related legal expenses.<ref>{{cite web |author=TMZ staff |date=July 26, 2008 |title=Britney Settlement Papers: Blow by Blow |url=http://www.tmz.com/2008/07/25/britney-settlement-papers-blow-by-blow/ |access-date=July 26, 2008 |publisher=tmz.com}}</ref>

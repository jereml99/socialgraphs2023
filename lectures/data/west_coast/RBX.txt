'''Eric Dwayne Collins''' (born October 8, 1967) better known by his stage name '''RBX''' (standing for "Reality Born Unknown"), is an American rapper from [[Long Beach, California]].

==Early life and education==
Contrary to popular belief, Collins is not related to funk legend [[Bootsy Collins]], although the two are close friends.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/rbx-09-2/|title= RBX Interview|author=Jose|access-date=17 June 2009 |work= Dubcnn Sits Down With RBX & Napsac Ent.|publisher=The Westcoast News Network. |date=June 17, 2009 }}</ref>

==Career==

===1992–1995: Death Row Records===
RBX joined [[Death Row Records]] in 1992 with his cousins [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Daz Dillinger]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.discogs.com/artist/RBX|title= RBX Discography|access-date=21 March 2009 |work= Discogs}}</ref> A former college student and retail manager, Collins declined to sign blank contracts like his Death Row brethren. His tenure on the label would be brief but memorable. Having made commanding cameos on ''[[The Chronic]]'' in 1992 and ''[[Doggystyle]]'' in 1993, RBX left the label in 1994 and signed with the lesser known Premeditated Records. He released ''[[The RBX Files]]'' in 1995, his debut solo album that was produced by former Chronic production team member Greg "Gregski" Royal.

The album abandoned the popular West Coast [[G-Funk]] style in favor of a "gritty, dungeon-like" sound more associated with New York. The single "A.W.O.L." was an attack on Death Row, Suge Knight, Dre, and others, with X comparing the dubious business practices there to the days of [[Ruthless Records]], [[Jerry Heller]], and [[Eazy-E]]. In a YouTube interview with [[DJ Vlad|VladTV]] he talked about an altercation over food between him and Suge Knight, in which Knight pulled out a gun.

===1996–2000: Aftermath Entertainment===
In 1996, RBX visited Dr. Dre at home and apologized for his harsh words on record and in magazines and immediately signed to Dre's new [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]] label. He was featured on the 1996 compilation ''[[Dr. Dre Presents... The Aftermath]]'' on the solo song "Blunt Time" and the group track "East Coast/West Coast Killaz" with [[KRS-One]], [[B-Real]] and [[Nas]], with both songs produced by Dre. Lost in the infamous reshuffling of Aftermath in 1998, RBX once again went solo and released his follow up album ''[[No Mercy, No Remorse]]'' on an independent label in 1999. He reappeared with Aftermath to cameo on [[Eminem]]'s ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' in 2000.

===2022–present: ''Hibernation Shivers''===
In 2022, RBX began work with Los Angeles based producers Sccit & Siavash The Grouch on his comeback album ''Hibernation Shivers''. The Labcabin Records release is set to include features from [[Spice-1]], [[MC Eiht]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Fatlip]], [[Project Pat]], [[Ras Kass]], [[Eligh]], [[Cold 187um]], [[Krayzie Bone]], [[Butch Cassidy (singer)|Butch Cassidy]], [[Kurupt]], [[Smoov-E]] & more. On April 20, 2022, RBX assisted Fatlip with the release of a single for Fatlip’s album, “Torpor”, in the Sccit & Siavash The Grouch produced song titled “Wake Up”. The single was accompanied by a music video, which was themed around the Los Angeles homeless epidemic. On July 7, 2023, RBX released the first single from “Hibernation Shivers”, titled “Nightstalker”. The single, which features Krayzie Bone, is a re-imagining of the infamous Los Angeles serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]]. <ref>{{cite web |url= https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.72169/title.the-pharcyde-reunites-on-fatlips-solo-album-torpor-featuring-krayzie-bone-ex-death-row-artist-rbx-more |title= Fatlip Album Features RBX|author=Kyle Eustice|access-date=1 August 2022 |publisher=hiphopdx. |date=August 1, 2022 }}</ref>

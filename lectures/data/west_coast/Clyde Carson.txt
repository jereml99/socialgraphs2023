'''Nyle Kalin Parrish''' (born June 2, 1981), better known by the stage name '''Clyde Carson''', is an American rapper from [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California. He was originally known as a member of the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[The Team (group)|The Team]]. After the group went on hiatus, he was the one member of the group to break out as a solo artist. He was signed to rapper [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]]'s [[The Black Wall Street Records]] and [[Capitol Records]] in 2006. While signed there he released the [[extended play|EP]] ''Doin' That''. However, he wasn't signed to them for long, before deciding to go back to releasing music independently via Moe Doe Entertainment. After returning to just that label, he has released two EPs: ''Bass Rock'' and ''Playboy''. He also released the song "Slow Down", which was featured on the 2013 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''.

He blends [[hyphy]] with street-styled rap.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/clyde-carson/id93313939|title=Clyde Carson is a member of the team and solo artist as well|publisher=[[iTunes]]|website=iTunes.com|access-date=February 22, 2016}}</ref>

== Career ==
Carson started his professional rapping career by selling his debut mixtape ''The Story Vol. 1'' out of the trunk of his car in 2001. After sneaking backstage at a [[Total Request Live|TRL]] concert he met producer [[Ty Fyffe]], who he forged a close friendship with. Shortly after he moved to New York City with Ty Fyffe, staying there for almost a year. There he joined Fyffe to studio sessions with rappers such as [[Jay-Z]] and [[Cam'ron]].<ref name="laweekly1">{{cite web |last=Haithcoat |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2012/12/06/clyde-carson-finally-has-a-big-hit-with-slow-down |title=Clyde Carson Finally Has a Big Hit with "Slow Down" &#124; West Coast Sound &#124; Los Angeles &#124; Los Angeles News and Events |publisher=LA Weekly |date=October 3, 2013 |access-date=April 5, 2014 |archive-date=November 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111015900/http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2012/12/06/clyde-carson-finally-has-a-big-hit-with-slow-down |url-status=dead }}</ref> This increased his confidence. On meeting, Fyffe he stated<ref name="laweekly1" /> "I wanted to get up out of Oakland. This was before they were playing local music on the radio, other than E-40."

Then in 2002, Carson moved back to California and formed the hip hop group [[The Team (band)|The Team]], with local [[Bay Area]] rappers Mayne Mannish and Kaz Kyzah. They released a project on local rapper [[Keak da Sneak]]'s record label<ref name="laweekly1" /> and got put into local radio rotation. They then gained more popularity in late 2005 after releasing the singles "Just Go" and "Bottles Up" to promote their third studio album, ''[[World Premiere (The Team album)|World Premiere]]'', which peaked at number 95 on the US [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, and number 50 on the [[Top Independent Albums|''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums]] chart.<ref name="AMG">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p671081/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} ((( The Team > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums )))].

With the help of rapper [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] and his [[Black Wall Street Records]], Carson secured a major record label deal with Moedoe and [[Capitol Records]] in 2006.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/clyde-carson-interview-0727071/ |title=Clyde Carson Interview |publisher=Djbooth.net |access-date=April 5, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091020/http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/clyde-carson-interview-0727071/ |archive-date=April 7, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On his signing, he asserted<ref name="laweekly1" /> "As a rapper, there's no ceiling in L.A.

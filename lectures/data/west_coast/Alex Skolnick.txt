'''Alex Skolnick''' (born September 29, 1968) is an American musician. He is best known as the lead guitarist and one of the songwriters of the [[thrash metal]] band [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and has played with several other bands, including The Alex Skolnick Trio, [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]], [[Savatage]] and the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] supergroup [[Metal Allegiance]].

Skolnick began his musical career at the age of 15 when he joined the local [[Bay Area thrash metal]] band Legacy, which eventually became Testament, and performed on five albums with them, between ''[[The Legacy (album)|The Legacy]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Ritual (Testament album)|The Ritual]]'' (1992). By the time he left Testament in 1992, Skolnick had found considerable fame among the thrash metal and guitar communities; ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine named him one of the greatest guitarists of all time,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/readers-poll-results-100-greatest-guitarists-all-time |title=Readers Poll Results: The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |publisher=Guitar World |access-date=2014-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025131228/http://www.guitarworld.com/readers-poll-results-100-greatest-guitarists-all-time |archive-date=October 25, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and as one of the "fastest guitarists of all time".<ref>{{cite web|title=Need for Speed: The 50 Fastest Guitarists of All Time – Page 43|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/50-fastest-guitarists-all-time?page=1,42|access-date=2014-07-17|publisher=Guitar World}}</ref>

After his first departure from Testament, Skolnick went on to pursue various musical careers, including briefly replacing [[Criss Oliva]] in Savatage for their album ''[[Handful of Rain]]'' (1994), and starting his [[jazz fusion|jazz]] band The Alex Skolnick Trio in the early 2000s, which remains active as of 2021. He briefly reunited with Testament in 2001 for the re-recordings of their early songs on the album ''[[First Strike Still Deadly]]'', and then returned to the band on a permanent basis in 2005, contributing to four more albums.

===Career in music===
====Testament====
Skolnick joined the [[Bay Area thrash metal|San Francisco Bay Area thrash metal]] band [[Testament (band)|Testament]], then-called Legacy, in 1984 as the replacement of original guitarist Derrick Ramirez. Skolnick was just eighteen years old when he recorded his debut album with Testament, ''[[The Legacy (album)|The Legacy]]'' (1987), which received critical acclaim from both music critics and fans alike. The band's next four albums, ''[[The New Order (album)|The New Order]]'' (1988), ''[[Practice What You Preach]]'' (1989), ''[[Souls of Black]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Ritual (Testament album)|The Ritual]]'' (1992), cemented Testament's reputation as one of the premier bands of the thrash metal genre and nearly gave them the same level of popularity as the "Big Four" ([[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]).<ref name="Billboard.com">{{cite web|title=Testament – Chart history|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/testament/chart-history/tlp/|publisher=Billboard.com|access-date=April 9, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=D.X. |last=Ferris |title=Talkin' Thrash |url=http://www.clevescene.com/2007-08-08/music/talkin-thrash |work=[[Cleveland Scene]] |date=August 8, 2007 |access-date=April 9, 2021 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110222020/http://www.clevescene.com/2007-08-08/music/talkin-thrash |archive-date=November 10, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Diamond |last=Oz |title=Sunday Old School: Testament |url=https://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=70452 |work=Metal Underground |date=July 31, 2011 |access-date=April 9, 2021 }}</ref> In late 1992, several months after the release of ''The Ritual'', Skolnick opted to leave the band, citing his weariness of playing thrash metal music and his desire to explore musically outside of Testament as the reasons behind his departure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alex Skolnick: Interview with Metal Rules!! |url=https://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/alex.htm |work=Metal Rules |access-date=April 9, 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tprs.com/interviews/interview-alex-skolnick-of-testament/ |title=TPRS Classic Interview: Alex Skolnick of Testament |publisher=The Pure Rock Shop |accessdate=April 9, 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Fabricus |first=Jodie |title=Metal Filings |magazine=The Hard Report |issue=295 |publication-date=September 25, 1992 |location=Medford, New Jersey |publisher=Hard Report, Inc. |page=54 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Hard-Report/1992/Hard-1992-09-25.pdf |access-date=April 9, 2021 }}</ref>

Skolnick returned briefly to Testament by re-recording old material for their ninth album ''[[First Strike Still Deadly]]'', as well as the Thrash of the Titans performance in 2001. He officially rejoined the band in 2005 for a short European tour with some American dates appended. A CD/DVD release was put together from [[Live in London (Testament album)|the London show]] of May 8, 2005. On April 29, 2008, Testament released ''[[The Formation of Damnation]]'', its first studio album with original material in nine years and with Skolnick in sixteen years. Their next album, ''[[Dark Roots of Earth]]'' (2012), debuted at No. 12 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 Albums chart, at No.1 on the ''Billboard'' Hard Rock and Rock albums chart, and No. 9 on the World Chart.<ref name ="Billboard.com"/> Skolnick has since recorded two more albums with Testament, ''[[Brotherhood of the Snake]]'' (2016) and ''[[Titans of Creation]]'' (2020).

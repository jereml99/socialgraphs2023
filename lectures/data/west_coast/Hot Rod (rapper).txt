'''Rodney Toole''' (born June 25, 1981) better known by his [[stage name]] '''Hot Rod''' (formerly '''Young Hot Rod'''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftermathmusic.com/blog/interviews/2007/hot-rod-march-2007 |title=Aftermath Music dot com &#124; Dr. Dre Eminem 50 Cent Busta Rhymes Stat Quo Eve Bishop Lamont G.A.G.E |website=Aftermathmusic.com |access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> is an American [[rapper]] from [[Sacramento, California]], United States. In 2006, Hot Rod secured a recording contract with [[New York City]]-based rapper [[50 Cent]]'s [[G-Unit Records]]. In 2010 he was moved to [[G-Note Records]], a subsidiary label of G-Unit Records, which focuses on [[pop music|pop]], [[Dance music|dance]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/hotrod |title=HOT ROD &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos |website=Myspace.com |access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>

==Early life==
Raised in [[Sacramento, California]], until the age of 24, Hot Rod worked as mortgage broker until spotted by the [[G-Unit]] boss [[50 Cent]], who signed him to his label in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/young-hot-rod-p823685 |title=Record Reviews, Streaming Songs, Genres & Bands |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Hot Rod would send his homemade demo CD to 50 Cent's G-Unit office's in hope the record label would sign him. After 50 Cent heard the CD he thought that Hot Rod's easy flow reminded him of his own. It was December 2005 when the 24-year-old rapper received a call at his day job as a mortgage broker, and it wasn't from any random G-Unit associate but 50 Cent himself.<ref>[http://twilightwhisper.com/gossip/50-Cent-strategizes-next-moves-for-GUnit-new-artist-search-2158339.html]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><br/>
Hot Rod started in hip-hop as a teenager in the mid ‘90s, making beats. “When my pops made me his assistant music engineer at the church. That's when I realized my passion for music,” he reflects, “I've always had it in my blood so there was no stopping me from that point on”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2413624/bio|title=Hot Rod|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>

== Musical career ==
===Solo career===
Hot Rod released his first single in August 2006, called "Be Easy" which featured R&B singer [[Mary J. Blige]] under the labels [[G-Unit Records|G-Unit]] / [[Interscope Records|Interscope]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/be-easy-single/id184988184 |title=Be Easy - Single by Young Hot Rod on Apple Music |website=Itunes.apple.com |access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The single failed to gain any major chart success and therefore he was dropped from the label [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] in late 2006. Hot Rod was the first of various rappers to host the [[Digital Dynasty]] series.<ref>[http://www.ballerstatus.com%20BallerStatus]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Early life and education==
{{expand section| date= September 2020}}
Born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], Roundtree and his family subsequently relocated to [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] before then moving to [[Riverside, California]] when he was nine.<ref name="The Boombox" /> He first started rapping in 1983.<ref name="Jeff Pearlman" />

He graduated from [[Canyon Springs High School (Moreno Valley, California)|Canyon Springs High School]] in [[Moreno Valley]] before moving back to Los Angeles in 1993.

==Career==

Skee-Lo's debut album ''[[I Wish (Skee-Lo album)|I Wish]]'' was released in 1995, which he first started working on in 1993. The album was a huge success. One of the singles, "Top of the Stairs", was featured in the ending credits as well as the soundtrack to the 1995 film ''[[Money Train]]''. He quietly "retired" from rapping five months after the album's release because of a dispute with [[record label|label]] Sunshine Records. Skee-Lo claims Sunshine Records took all the credit from the album's success, and he did not make a single cent from it.<ref name="LA Weekly" /> "So I refused to shoot any more videos, promote or record music. I'm not their slave. I wasn't working for free."<ref name="LA Weekly" /> After many years, he eventually won the rights against the label in court.

Skee-Lo recorded a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Schoolhouse Rock!]] song "The Tale of Mr. Morton", which taught sentence structure ([[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[verb]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]). The song appears on the 1996 compilation album, ''[[Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundcheck.wnyc.org/story/268041-skee-lo-morton/ |title=Skee-Lo Raps 'The Tale of Mr. Morton' |website= Soundcheck.wnyc.org |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2016-01-19}}</ref>

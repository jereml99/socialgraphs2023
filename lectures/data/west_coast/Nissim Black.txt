== Career ==
=== First Sportn' Life recordings: ''Behind the Dirt'' and ''The Cause & Effect'' (2002–2007) ===
{{main|The Cause and Effect}}
Black began rapping in his preteens, recording under the name Danger. When he was 13, producer Vitamin D moved his studio into Black's stepfather's basement and began mentoring the boy, producing some of his first official recordings.<ref name=amg>{{cite web|author1=Cyril Cordor|title=D.

In 2002, Sportn' Life Records published its first release, a [[split album|split]] [[vinyl record|vinyl]] single between Black and the group Last Men Standing. The following year, Black appeared on a Sportn' Life [[compilation album]], alongside several members of [[Oldominion]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/my-philosophy/Content?oid=15339922 | title=My Philosophy | publisher=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] | date=November 21, 2012 | access-date=22 August 2015 | author=Larry Mizell Jr.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://sportnliferecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-sportn-life-compilation-vol-1 | title=The Sportn' Life Compilation Vol 1 | publisher=[[Bandcamp]] | access-date=22 August 2015}}</ref> In 2004, the 18-year-old Black was selected by his stepfather to replace him as co-[[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Sportn' Life, together with his father's partner, DeVon Manier.<ref name="amg" /><ref name="st1" /> In addition to running the label, Black began releasing singles like "You Need a Thug" and "This Is Why" (the latter produced by [[Jake One]], whom he had associated with early on).<ref name="amg" /> On May 24, 2005, Black released his first Sportn' Life [[mixtape]] ''Behind the Dirt'', which featured appearances from [[J Smooth]] and Darrius Willrich of [[Maktub]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://sportnliferecords.bandcamp.com/album/free-behind-the-dirt-mixtape | title=Behind the Dirt&nbsp;— Mixtape by D.Black | publisher=[[Bandcamp]] | access-date=22 August 2015}}</ref>

In 2007, he released his debut album, ''[[The Cause & Effect]]''.

=== ''Ali'yah'', retirement, and conversion to Orthodox Judaism (2008–2011) ===
{{main|Ali'yah (album)}}
[[File:Nissim at Sas.jpg|thumbnail|left|Black performing in May 2013]]
After ''The Cause and Effect''{{'s}} release, Black, now a husband and father, began questioning his Christian beliefs, turning to [[Messianic Judaism]] and convincing his wife to follow suit.<ref name="tablet" /><ref name="aish" /> He also started listening to artists like [[Common (rapper)|Common]] and [[Lauryn Hill]];<ref name=stranger /> both developments began to strongly influence his music. In 2008, he contributed to Jake One's debut album, ''[[White Van Music]]'', with the song "God Like", which received play on [[MTV]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Benji Rosen|title=The religious rapper: A journey out of the darkness|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Arts/Al-HaNissim-333110|website=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|access-date=14 August 2015|date=Nov 26, 2013}}</ref>

In 2009, Black released his second album, ''[[Ali'yah (album)|Ali'yah]]''. The album spent five weeks at number 4 on [[CMJ]]'s hip hop charts, while the video for its lead single, "Yesterday", also gained regular rotation on MTV.<ref name=aish /> That same year, he performed at [[Bumbershoot]]<ref name="st2">{{cite web | url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/matsononmusic/2009840960_d_black_22-year-old_rapper_fat.html | title=D.

Six months after the album's release, Black renounced his belief in [[Jesus]] and Christianity. No longer supporting the album's message but unable to quit his contract, he agreed to promote it, but refused to accept money outside of touring expenses and refused to perform on [[Shabbat]].<ref name=aish /> He officially retired in 2011 after releasing ''The Blackest Brown'' EP with friend and fellow rapper Bradley "B." Brown. He subsequently moved to Seward Park's Jewish community and began studying for conversion with Rabbi Simon Benzaquen at the [[Sephardic Bikur Holim Congregation]]. During this time, he cut off all connections to his previous career, including abandoning his position at Sportn' Life and even getting rid of his own music collection.<ref name=tablet />

=== Return to rapping, ''Nissim'', and ''Lemala'' (2012–2017) ===
[[File:Rapper-Nissim-Black.jpg|thumb|180px|Black in September 2016]]
Near the end of his conversion process, Black's son developed [[meningitis]] and had to be hospitalized, a blow to the financially struggling family. While praying over the situation in his study, Black discovered that a long-broken microphone had begun working again, and took this as a sign to return to music.<ref name=tablet /><ref name=aish />

He officially announced his return to music in September 2012.<ref name=tablet /> The following December, he appeared on the [[Shtar]] song "Rabbit Hole" from their album ''[[Boss EP]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Israeli Music Scene's Rising 'Shtar'|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/12/06/the-israeli-music-scene%E2%80%99s-rising-%E2%80%98shtar%E2%80%99/|publisher=[[Algemeiner Journal]]|access-date=11 January 2013|author=Marder, Rachel|date=Dec 6, 2012}}</ref>

On February 26, 2013, he released the mixtape ''Miracle Music'', his first official recording under his new stage name, Nissim.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nissimworld.bandcamp.com/album/miracle-music | title=Miracle Music by NISSIM | publisher=[[Bandcamp]] | access-date=22 August 2015}}</ref> The following May, he appeared at the 2013 [[Sasquatch! Music Festival]].<ref name=tablet /> Following a recording session in [[London Bridge Studio]], he released his first new album, the self-titled ''Nissim'', on September 17.<ref name=tablet /> He closed out the year with "The Black Miracle", a [[Hanukkah]] single produced by [[Aish HaTorah|Aish.com]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aish.com/h/c/mm/sf/The-Black-Miracle-A-HanukkahThanksgiving-Poetry-Slam.html | title=The Black Miracle: A Hanukkah Poetry Slam | publisher=[[Aish HaTorah|Aish.com]] | date=November 20, 2013 | access-date=21 August 2015 | format=video}}</ref>

In 2016, after relocating to [[Israel]], Nissim collaborated with [[Gad Elbaz]] on the song "Hashem Melech 2.0" and with [[Lipa Schmeltzer]] on  "Bar Mitzvah Time." The following year, on March 10, 2017, he released his fourth album, ''Lemala'', which featured collaborations with Elbaz, [[Shneur Hasofer|DeScribe]], Netanel Israel, and Yisroel Laub.

=== ''Gibor'' and ''Love Notes'' (2018–present) ===
Black returned in July 2018 with the single "King of the World", announced as the lead single of an upcoming fifth album entitled ''Gibor''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zweig |first=Yossi |date=July 23, 2018 |title=NISSIM BLACK – KING OF THE WORLD |url=https://www.thejewishinsights.com/wp/nissim-black-king-world/ |access-date=2022-10-13 |website=The Jewish Insights |language=en-US}}</ref> That December, he performed at a charity [[Hanukkah]] concert in [[Brooklyn]] alongside Shea Rubenstein, [[Mendy Pellin]], and [[Six13]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zweig |first=Yossi |date=2018-11-18 |title=CHANUKAH NISSIM: Nissim Black, Shea Rubenstein, Mendy Pellin, Six13, Asher Laub, Dovid Pearlman |url=https://www.thejewishinsights.com/wp/chanukah-nissim-nissim-black-shea-rubenstein-mendy-pellin-six13-asher-laub-dovid-pearlman/ |access-date=2022-10-13 |website=The Jewish Insights |language=en-US}}</ref> ''Gibor'' was released on December 9, 2019 through Marom Entertainment, with guest features including Menachem Weinstein, Avi Kraus, and [[Alex Clare]]. This was also the first official album to credit Black as Nissim Black rather than simply Nissim (he had been using both intermittently since 2016). 

In February 2020, Black released a new standalone single, "Mothaland Bounce". The song, released with a ''[[Coming to America]]''-inspired music video directed by Leon Robinson and Joel Kipnis, addresses the relationship between the rapper's Black and Jewish identities, such as Black describing himself as "''[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s worst nightmare''".<ref name=":0" /> Following two more singles, "Win" and "Best Friend", Black released a new mixtape entitled ''Love Notes'' on August 16, 2020.

Since ''Love Notes'', Black has released a string of singles and collaborated with artists including Yosef Daniel, [[Kosha Dillz]], [[Shlomo Katz]], and [[Levi Robin]]. "Mothaland Bounce" peaked at No. 4 on the Israeli charts, while "The Hanukkah Song 2.0" and "Adored" peaked at No. 5 and No. 21 respectively.<ref name=":1" />

When O'Connor was seven years old, his family moved to [[Howell, Michigan]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/37214/1/bones-interview-underground-rap-king|title=BONES on record labels, being beaten up & living meme kids|last=Dazed|date=2017-09-07|work=Dazed|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en}}</ref> O'Connor also lived in Minnesota for two years when he was thirteen. Around this time he met fellow artists [[Xavier Wulf]], [[Chris Travis]], and [[Eddy Baker]] online. The four artists would later come together to form the collective Seshollowaterboyz.<ref name=":4">{{Citation|last=Kinda Neat|title=KINDA NEAT EPISODE 73: SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ|date=2017-06-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7r3fKnwfj0|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>

When he was 16, he dropped out of [[Howell High School (Howell, Michigan)|Howell High School]] and moved to [[Los Angeles]], where his brother and current manager, Elliott, had already been living.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/la-rapper-bones-has-some-of-the-eeriest-videos-in-the-music-business-and-a-sound-all-his-own-4198954|title=L.A.

==Musical career==
O'Connor first started making music at the age of nine after his father purchased an [[iMac G3]]. He would download [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] instrumentals from [[SoundClick]] and use the computer's built-in microphone to record himself rapping, though it wasn't until 2010 at the age of 16 that he would start releasing music online under the alias "Th@ Kid". After moving to Los Angeles, O'Connor connected with other artists he met online including [[Xavier Wulf]], [[Chris Travis]], and [[Eddy Baker]], who at the time were members of the now semi-disbanded [[Raider Klan]].<ref name=":4" /> He later officially changed his stage name to Bones in 2012.

On July 4, 2012, O'Connor released his eponymous debut album under the alias Bones. From 2012 to 2014 he released 12 albums<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://dadstheme.blogspot.com/2014/06/bones-aka-th-kid-complete-discography.html|title=I'm in hell: BONES aka "Th@ Kid" Complete Discography (All Albums, Mixtapes, Etc.)

Although O'Connor does experiment with this style in his solo work, surrenderdorothy features it much more predominantly. Since 2014, the duo have released six [[Extended play|EPs]] as surrenderdorothy.

O'Connor uploaded several albums in 2015<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pigeonsandplanes.com/music/2014/09/download-bones-new-mixtape-skinny|title=Download Bones' New Mixtape "Skinny"|work=PigeonsandPlanes|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pigeonsandplanes.com/music/2015/04/listen-to-bones-powder-mixtape|title=Listen to Bones' 'Powder' Mixtape|work=PigeonsandPlanes|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.themaskedgorilla.com/bones-you-should-have-seen-your-face-ep-stream/|title=Stream Bones' New EP, 'YouShouldHaveSeenYourFace'|website=Masked Gorilla |language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hypebeast.com/2015/5/bones-youshouldhaveseenyourface-ep|title=Bones - YouShouldHaveSeenYourFace (EP)|work=HYPEBEAST|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref> and headlined his first sold-out show at [[House of Blues]] on March 4, 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/elliottoconnor/status/573410859969441792|title=Elliott O'Connor - Twitter|date=March 5, 2015|website=Twitter|access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/elliottoconnor/status/573405431323742208|title=Elliott O'Connor - Twitter|date=March 5, 2015|website=Twitter|access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref> before opening for electronic artist [[Shlohmo]] at [[The Fonda Theatre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/shlohmo/status/573935496432242690|title=Shlohmo - Twitter|date=March 6, 2015|website=[[Twitter]]|access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref> O'Connor was later featured on [[ASAP Rocky]]'s "Canal St.", which was a remix of O'Connor's song "Dirt".

The project is stylistically similar to Surrenderdorothy, but has been noted as having a "darker" and "rougher" tone. It also follows a loose narrative related to the [[The Oregon Trail (1985 video game)|game]] of the same name which is also reflected in the artwork of the singles. Since 2015, the duo have released seven singles as Oregontrail.

O'Connor released 10 albums between 2015 and 2017.<ref name=":5" /> In 2016, he began releasing music under a new persona called Ricky A Go Go. He uploaded five tracks in total to a SoundCloud account for this persona with the fifth one being uploaded in 2017. There's a running joke in the description for each track as each one is the single for an album of a different name. None of these albums have released. These tracks have a [[disco]], [[funk]], or [[synthwave]] production style with sung vocals. There is a sixth track titled "Countdown" that is not on this account but has been uploaded by several other users. This track comes from the track "SeshRadio: Volume3" which is the final track on his ''PaidProgramming2'' project. This was the official debut of the persona. The Ricky A Go Go persona has made appearances on multiple other tracks in the Bones discography on various projects, most prominently the collaboration project ''DamagedGoods'' with Drew The Architect. However, a majority of these tracks still credit Bones as the artist.

On January 19, 2018, O'Connor performed in [[KOKO (music venue)|KOKO]], London, thus starting his first ever European tour, called the Deadboy Tour.<ref>[https://bonesontour.com Deadboy Tour]</ref> It took him to countries such as Germany, Ukraine, Russia and Italy.

O'Connor is a founding member of the collective Seshollowaterboyz, along with Xavier Wulf and Eddy Baker, with whom he often performs and collaborates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacurrent.com/sanantonio/inside-game-bones-and-the-weird-world-of-internet-rap/Content?oid=2249971|title=Inside Game: Bones and the weird world of internet rap|date=June 10, 2014|website=San Antonio Current|access-date=2015-03-12}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/delving-past-yung-lean-and-deeper-into-the-world-of-sad-rap|title=Delving Past Yung Lean and Deeper Into The World of Sad Rap|date=August 1, 2014|access-date=2015-03-13}}</ref> The name of the collective is a mash-up of their self-releasing [[Record label|labels]] TeamSESH, Hollow Squad.

==Musical style and influences==
Although O'Connor is often considered to be one of the pioneers of the [[emo rap]] sub-genre, O'Connor has said that he has no specific genre, though has been characterized as cloud rap, experimental hip-hop and "shadow rap".<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/37214/1/bones-interview-underground-rap-king|title=BONES on record labels, being beaten up & living meme kids|last=Dazed|date=2017-09-07|work=Dazed|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/rmazjn/delving-past-yung-lean-and-deeper-into-the-world-of-sad-rap|title=Delving Past Yung Lean and Deeper Into the World of Sad Rap|date=2014-08-01|work=Noisey|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-uk}}</ref><ref name="auto2" /> O'Connor's earlier music is a lot more futuristic (and is often compared to [[SpaceGhostPurrp]]'s<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.themaskedgorilla.com/recruited-bones/|title=RECRUITED: Bones|website=Masked Gorilla |language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>) than his current music, which showcases production and vocal styles ranging from rapping, singing, and [[screaming (music)|screaming]].<ref name="The FADER"/> O'Connor's singing has been compared to [[grunge]] and [[emo]], while his rapping has been compared sub-genres such as [[horrorcore]] and [[emo rap]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://respect-mag.com/2014/06/album-download-bones-garbage/|title=Album Download: Bones - Garbage {{!}} RESPECT.|website=respect-mag.com|date=13 June 2014 |language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref> He is also considered an early pioneer of [[trap metal]].<ref name="Kerrang" />

O'Connor rarely talks about his musical influences, although during interviews he has mentioned  [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Earth Wind and Fire]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] as influences.<ref name=":2" /> Over the years of his music career, O'Connor helped underground hip hop develop into new styles and has been noted as "one of the most influential underground artists of the internet age".<ref name="dazed2017" />

== Early life ==

I was in a few bands before that; I was a drummer and a guitar player. I was a huge metal head and I loved rap like Mac Dre and Andre Nickatina. You could make electronic music by yourself, so that really attracted me towards it and made me want to do my own thing".<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7123837/getter-radical-dude-ep-interview-dance|title=Getter Dishes on Face-Melting Music Videos and 'Radical Dude!'

== Career ==
=== 2012–13: Beginnings ===
[[File:GetterLogo-300x129.png|thumb|right|250px|Getter's logo]]
Petulla said in an interview that on his 19th birthday, he saved up money to move to [[Los Angeles]] before staying at a friend's room for a few months.<ref name=":2" /> He expanded from there and began to develop musically before getting his own apartment and studio.<ref name=":2" />

Petulla signed to Firepower Records run by Datsik in 2012 before signing with [[Owsla]], a record label founded by dubstep pioneer Skrillex.<ref name=":4" /> He gained popularity when he began making “SUH Dude” vines with [[Nick Colletti]] and [[Dillon Francis]].<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wetheunicorns.com/features/nick-coletti-getter-7-classic-moments-from-vines-funniest-bromance/#AfFoLI5wEQguxiwP.97|title=5 Reasons Why Nick Colletti & Getter Are Vine’s FUNNIEST Bromance|last=Townsend|first=Benedict|date=27 April 2016|newspaper=We The Unicorns|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> He also said that after touring, he plans to work on 'getting something like a TV show or a movie going' with Colletti.<ref name=":7">{{cite web|url=http://runthetrap.com/2016/09/02/getter-is-fricking-killing-it-ep-release-interview/|title=Getter is Fricking Killing It [EP Release + Interview]|last=Chung|first=Max|date=2 September 2016|website=Run The Trap|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>

Petulla first joined Skrillex's OWSLA when he sent his demo before Skrillex heard and told him that he liked it. Petulla then sent another track which is now titled ''Head Splitter'' and Skrillex said 'he wanted it for OWSLA'. Petulla said "We just became friends from there; he introduced me to his team. Now we all work together, and they see what I’m trying to do, which is really cool, because they support it and have the resources to make it happen. Me and Skrillex have a super-similar taste in heavy bass music, so I’ll send him new tracks and new artists”.<ref name=":2" />

=== 2014–15: ''Trenchlords'' project and ''Planet Neutral'' ===
Petulla released his ''Trenchlords Vol. 1'' EP; the first installment from his new music project called, ''Trench''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.edmtunes.com/2014/11/bass-producer-getter-creates-new-trench-music-project/|title=Bass Producer, Getter Creates New "Trench" Music Project - EDMTunes|last=Susalka|first=Morgan|date=20 November 2014|newspaper=EDMTunes|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-19|archive-date=2016-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120003748/http://www.edmtunes.com/2014/11/bass-producer-getter-creates-new-trench-music-project/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Four songs from the EP, includes a collaborations with Algo and Deemed.<ref name=":3" /> When asked about his opinion on genres, Petulla said "I feel like genres are necessary to classify what you like, same with certain sub genres. I’m just not a fan of sub genres that not only sound stupid, but can be put on anything that has the smallest element of that class".<ref name=":3" /> Speaking about the project, the name ''Trench'' and its significance, Petulla said "I just think the name sounds tight, and is short and sweet. A Trenchlord is someone who I think makes fuckin’ dope music that I collaborate with and recruit to the trench project."<ref name=":3" /> The idea ''Trench'' came into the scene when Petulla and his close friends realized they represent the 'heavier/underground' side of dubstep music, which was then he started the Trench project, with fellow artists being labeled Trenchlords.<ref name=":3" /> On giving it away for free, he said that he wants his fans to enjoy his music, which was his main priority.<ref name=":3" />

On 23 October 2015, Petulla released a nine-second tease of a new collaborative track with Skrillex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youredm.com/2015/10/22/getter-and-skrillex-preview-heavy-new-collaboration/|title=The Massive Skrillex Collaboration You Need To Hear Today & No, It's Not With Justin Bieber|last=Rubinstein|first=Peter|date=22 October 2015|website=Your EDM|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> On 28 November 2015, Petulla returned to Vancouver, BC at Red Room Ultra Bar to perform.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=http://dancemusicnw.com/getter-brings-the-bass-to-red-room-vancouver-video-recap/|title=Getter Brings The Bass To Red Room Vancouver: Video Recap|last=Frazier|first=Cameron|date=9 December 2015|newspaper=Dance Music NW|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> In 2015, Petulla released an EP under the alias “Planet Neutral” that showed a reserved, mellow, more relaxed side to himself.<ref name=":5">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shawn-russell-johnson/getters-radical-dude-brin_b_9443436.html|title=Getter's 'Radical Dude' Brings In The Filth|last=Johnson|first=Shawn|date=14 March 2016|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-18|last4=.}}</ref>

On 29 January 2016, a compilation album titled "Worldwide Broadcast" by OWSLA was released, featuring Petulla's collaboration with [[Ghastly (DJ)|Ghastly]] titled "666!".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/owsla-worldwide-broadcast/id1075925446|title=OWSLA Worldwide Broadcast by Various Artists on Apple Music|website=iTunes|publisher=Apple|access-date=2016-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youredm.com/2016/01/19/owsla-to-premiere-new-tunes-from-skrillex-alvin-risk-getter-and-more/|title=Skrillex Unveils Plans To Rule 2016 With Massive Unreleased Collabs|last=Tost|first=Miguel|date=19 January 2016|website=Your EDM|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>

On 11 March 2016, Petulla released an EP titled ''Radical Dude!''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/radical-dude!-ep/id1086159221|title=Radical Dude! - EP by Getter on Apple Music|website=iTunes|publisher=Apple|access-date=2016-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thebanginbeats.com/2016/09/06/getter-wat-the-frick-ep/|title=Getter – Wat The Frick [EP]|last=Murthi|first=Rajrishi|date=6 September 2016|website=Bangin Beats|access-date=2016-11-18|archive-date=2016-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120004205/http://thebanginbeats.com/2016/09/06/getter-wat-the-frick-ep/|url-status=dead}}</ref> with heavy dub, bass-driven, and grimy songs.<ref name=":5" /> The first song on the EP, entitled “Back” is bass-heavy, 'fun and laid-back piece'.<ref name=":5" /> The fifth and sixth songs on the EP, "In The Cuts" featuring Sneek and "Blood" with Adair featuring Georgia Ku, consist of 'extraterrestrial synths, dreamy vocals, and atmospheric swells'.<ref name=":5" />

In May 2016, Petulla starred in Dillon Francis' seven-episode reality TV-esque web series titled ''DJ World'' about the worst DJ stereotypes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mixmag.net/read/dillon-francis-debuts-online-reality-show-parody-dj-world-news|title=Dillon Francis debuts online reality show parody, 'DJ World'|last=Jow|first=Sydney|date=24 May 2016|newspaper=Mixmag|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> The first episode was shared on 24 May 2016 which stars Francis, [[Nick Colletti]] and Petulla as obnoxious characters who epitomize the dance music stereotypes and every terrible festival fashion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7385078/dillon-francis-mock-reality-show-dj-world-dance|title=Watch the First Episode of Dillon Francis' Mock Reality Show 'DJ World'|last=Brown|first=Lisa|date=25 May 2016|newspaper=Billboard|access-date=2016-11-19}}</ref>

On 2 September 2016, Petulla released his new seven-track EP titled ''[[Wat the Frick]]'' via OWSLA.<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wat-the-frick-ep/id1141044032|title=Wat the Frick EP by Getter on Apple Music|website=iTunes|publisher=Apple|access-date=2016-11-19}}</ref> Speaking in an interview about the EP, Petulla said "My main goal for everything is that I want to put out something that everyone will like. Not just a basshead, or a trap dude, or whatever, but I want to have different worlds for each kind of music, so each EP will probably be pretty mixed up".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shawn-russell-johnson/getter-takes-his-music-in_b_9499016.html|title=Getter Takes His Music In A New Direction|last=Johnson|first=Shawn|date=18 March 2016|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-18|last4=.}}</ref> When asked about the difference of the EP and his other EPs, Petulla said "I think the biggest thing is that they’re all solo tracks. No collaborations".<ref name=":7" /> On the same day, OWSLA released an official music video<ref>{{Citation|last=OWSLA|title=Getter - Head Splitter (Official Video) (YouTube)|date=2 September 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YllipGl2Is|access-date=2016-11-19}}</ref> directed by Liam Underwood<ref name=":2" /> for Petulla's song "Head Splitter" which also appeared on OWSLA's Spring Compilation 2015 album in March.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/owsla-spring-compilation-2015/id973810523|title=OWSLA Spring Compilation 2015 by Various Artists on Apple Music|website=iTunes|publisher=Apple|access-date=2016-11-19}}</ref> The video starts ominously at a burger joint named Grim Jim's, and as soon as the main character finishes his meal, his face dissolves into a cartoon smear of greens and purples. As he makes his way through Los Angeles, he finds the same goo popping up all around him.<ref name=":2" />

In November 2016, he shared some unreleased tracks, that failed to be included on ''Wat the Frick'' EP, to SoundCloud.<ref name=":8">{{cite web|url=http://edmchicago.com/2016/11/15/listen-getter-releases-three-previously-unreleased-songs/|title=Listen: Getter Releases Three Previously-Unreleased Songs|last=Wolfe|first=Sean|date=15 November 2016|website=EDM Chicago|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> The songs include “Phantom of tha Opera”, “Love Me No More” and “Tourettes Squad”.<ref name=":8" /> The first of the three is a "chilled-out and with a decided hip hop vibe"-trap song similar to the second one.<ref name=":8" /> The third song has more of an electro influence but chopped up and is more to dubstep than the trap genre.<ref name=":8" />

=== 2017–2019: Shred Collective, ''Visceral'' ===
It was announced that Petulla will appear at Canada's Snowbombing music festival alongside several other notable musicians and artists, in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/music/817537/coors-light-snowbombing-canada-announces-first-acts-its-2017-debut|title=Coors Light Snowbombing Canada announces first acts for its 2017 debut|last=Wilson|first=Kate|date=27 October 2016|access-date=2016-11-18|newspaper=Georgia Straight Vancouver's News & Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> Petulla launched Shred Collective – his own record label, clothing brand, and artist collective.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":14" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youredm.com/2017/03/07/getter-launches-collective-crazy-new-song-listen/|title=Getter Launches His Own Label & Collective With Face-Melting New Original [LISTEN]|last=Powell|first=Karlie|date=2017-03-07|website=Your EDM|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref> ''Inhalant Abuse'' was released as the label's first track on 10 March 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://edm.com/articles/2017/3/7/getter-shred-collective|title=Getter Launches New Shred Collective with Leading Bass Single "Inhalant Abuse" [LISTEN]|last=Culham|first=Devin|date=2017-03-07|work=EDM.com|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912101839/http://edm.com/articles/2017/3/7/getter-shred-collective|archive-date=2017-09-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Petulla announced his debut full-length album as Getter, ''Visceral'', on March 17, 2018, having released the first single "Colorblind" on February 7. In an interview with Run The Trap, Petulla explained that the album would move away from his dance music roots:

{{Blockquote
|text=New album is coming out mid-2018 and its definitely my favorite, best work.  I have been working on it for 2 years, it tells an even bigger story than this song. Colorblind is actually the only “hard” song on the album. Every song represents a piece of me or a part of my life. This single is obviously the dark side of it all.<ref>{{cite web|title=Getter Lets It All Out On New Song ‘Colorblind’ + Interview|last=Serrano|first=Omar|date=February 7, 2018|website=RUN THE TRAP|url=https://runthetrap.com/2018/02/07/getter-colorblind-interview/}}</ref>

In October 2019, Petulla teased the release of a single "When It's All Gone" on his social media platforms.

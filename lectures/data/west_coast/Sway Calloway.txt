==Early career==
As a [[teenager]] growing up in [[Oakland, California]], Sway became a locally known [[rapper]] and [[b-boy]] [[busking|performing]] on [[San Francisco]]'s [[Pier 39]].<ref>Entzminger, Angela. [http://theanimatorsjournal.blogspot.com/2007/04/office-of-film-theater-and-broadcasting.html Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting Hosts Second Annual Careers in Television Event] The Animator's Journal: April 28, 2007.</ref> He teamed up with [[DJ]] [[King Tech]] after [[high school]] and the duo performed at various [[San Francisco Bay Area]] clubs. They also released [[Indie (music)|independent]] albums. A [[major label]] [[record deal]] with [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] followed. The resulting [[album]], ''Concrete Jungle'' in 1990, got them the job of co-hosting their own show on [[radio station]] [[KMEL]].{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Another album, ''Back 2 Basics'' was released in 2005 on Sway and Tech's own [[record label]], Bolo Entertainment, which is distributed by [[Universal Music]].{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

==Radio==
''The Wake Up Show'' featured music and interviews with well-known [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists as well as up-and-coming ones. The show became very popular and began [[simulcasting]] to [[Los Angeles]] on [[KKLQ (FM)#KKBT|KKBT]] in 1993 and to [[Chicago]] on [[WNTD|WEJM]] by 1996.<ref name="wakeup">[http://www.wakeupshow.com/about.html Wake Up Show about page]</ref> [[Ras Kass]], [[Chino XL]] and [[Eminem]] are among the rappers who made their [[broadcasting]] debuts on the show. Soon, Sway was also hosting his own morning [[drive time]] show on the station.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

The popularity of the show helped Sway and Tech get another record deal, this time with [[Interscope Records]]. Their album, ''This or That'', reached #30 on [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #1 on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart in 1999.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p22006|pure_url=yes}} Sway & King Tech singles charts history] at [[Allmusic]]</ref> The album featured contributions from hip hop artists such as [[RZA]], [[Eminem]], [[Xzibit]], [[Kool G Rap]], [[KRS-One]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Tech N9ne]], [[Pharoahe Monch]] and [[The Roots]].<ref name="wakeup" /><ref name="mtv">[http://www.mtv.com/news/correspondents/sway/bio.jhtml Sway Calloway biography] at [[MTV]]</ref><ref>Conaway, Matt. [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r421386|pure_url=yes}} "This or That" overview]. [[Allmusic]]: 1999</ref> Sway also made an appearance on [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s DVD, [[The Reel Me]] in late 2003.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

Sway hosts a weekday morning show on Eminem’s [[Shade 45]] channel on [[SiriusXM]]! “Sway in the Morning” launched on Monday, July 18, 2011 on Shade 45 (SiriusXM channel 45) and airs Monday-Friday from 8am-12 noon ET.  The second week he was there [[Ludacris]] [http://www.fileswap.com/dl/NIdcVBaZ/sway_-_ludacris_-_bk1.mp3.html phoned in on the show] and they talked about his music and movie career. In an interview with The Source in 2012, Sway talked about his experiences in both satellite and terrestrial radio.<ref>Osorio, Kim.[http://thesource.com/2012/05/09/swaytalksaboutrevolutionizingradiointhenewissueofthesource/ Sway Talks About Revolutionizing Radio]. [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]: May 9, 2012</ref>

In November 2013, [[Kanye West]] appeared as a guest on his show and had an infamous meltdown on air, uttering memorable lines like "You ain't got the answers Sway, You ain't been doing the education".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kanye-west-flips-out-during-interview-with-sway-75073/ | title=Kanye West Flips Out During Interview|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=26 November 2013}}</ref>

==Television==
In 2000, Sway was approached by MTV to join the [[Television network|network]] as a [[correspondent]], becoming a regular reporter for its [[music video]] shows and [[news]] specials, including ''[[Total Request Live]]'' and the hip-hop music video show ''[[Sucker Free|Direct Effect]]''.<ref name="mtv" /> Because MTV's studios are based in [[New York City]], King Tech and ''The Wake Up Show'' went along with Sway in his move. Sway's prominence on MTV made the radio show even more popular than it was before. This inevitably led to a TV version of the show on MTV running briefly in January 2004. Sway and Tech also have a popular series of [[mixtapes]] that feature [[Freestyle rapping|freestyle]]s performed on the show. Sway recorded the voice introduction for the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a16020580/justin-timberlake-janet-jackson-super-bowl-halftime-show-wardrobe-malfunction/ | title=Revisiting the Justin Timberlake-Janet Jackson Wardrobe Malfunction, Minute by Minute | date=2 February 2018 }}</ref>

In September 2005, Sway decided not to renew his contract with MTV.  However, in 2006, Sway signed a new contract that included an ability to bring new projects to MTV, making him the first [[TV personality]] since [[Carson Daly]] to negotiate such a deal (Daly turned down a similar contract). He established the opportunity to produce [[Broadcast programming|programming]] with King Tech on MTV and other [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] channels as well as continue to host programs.<ref>Rashbaum, Alyssa.

'''Krystle Kantrece Johnson''' (born May 29, 1987), better known by her stage name '''Ak'Sent''', is an American rapper. She is from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

==Early life and career==
Ak'Sent's father Charles Johnson is of African-American descent, while her mother Magali Padilla is of Mexican descent. Ak'Sent grew up quickly thanks to a rough childhood.<ref>[http://www.aksent.com/bio.asp Biography]</ref><ref name="Ak'Sent - Interview Apr 07, 2006 c.05:30-07:15">{{Cite web |url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/aksent-interview/ |title=Ak'Sent Interview |access-date=2009-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830075719/http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/aksent-interview/ |archive-date=2008-08-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Her father was an aspiring rapper caught up in the gang lifestyle and was killed in a gang shooting when she was four years old, and with her mother unable to support her on her own, she was sent to live with her grandparents in [[South Central, Los Angeles]]. Ak'Sent was signed to [[Capitol Records]] when she was only 16. Since then she has worked with a number of well-known professionals such as The Jugganauts, [[DJ Quik]], & [[Beenie Man]].<ref name="allmusic">{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r828466|pure_url=yes}}</ref> Ak'Sent aims to avoid the glorification of violence and prefers to think of [[Hip-Hop]] as a form of "street poetry."<ref name="Ak'Sent - Interview Apr 07, 2006 c.05:30-07:15"/><ref name="raphiphopmusic">Aksent Song Review at raphiphopmusic dot com</ref>  Her first album, ''International'', was released on September 26, 2006.<ref name="allmusic"/> She released her second album ''Gem-In-I'' under the Avex label.<ref name="Gem-In-I Japan">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=AVCD-23626|title = GEM-IN-I Ak'SenT CD Album|website = CDJapan}}</ref> It was released on July 16, 2008 in [[Japan]] only.<ref name="Gem-In-I Japan"/> She is currently recording her third album and a mixtape.

===Behind the music===
Although Ak'Sent signed to a major label when she was only 16 years old, her African-American/Latino background had her wondering where to fit in. Adding to her challenges, rap music wasn't allowed in her grandparents' house, but as Ak'Sent learned more about her father's hip-hop aspirations, she decided she should carry on in his honor. She eventually spent time in several R&B-based girl groups and began dance training with Debbie Allen. One showcase at the age of 16 had the young multi-talent signed to Capitol and working with the production duo The Jugganauts. Ak'Sent was especially excited about the Caribbean-styled beats the Jugganauts were working on, and soon she was writing a series of dancehall numbers. One was the future hit "Zingy", featuring guest star [[Beenie Man]], who Ak'Sent herself had chosen because she was a huge fan. Her debut ''International'' landed in 2006 with a Spanish-language remix of "Zingy" and an ode to her departed father titled "My Life".<ref>[http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/aksent/3183826 Biography]</ref>

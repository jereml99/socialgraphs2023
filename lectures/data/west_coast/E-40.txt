== Music career ==
=== 1986–1999 ===
Stevens made his rap debut as E-40 in 1986 with Jones (performing as [[B-Legit]]), sister [[Suga T]], and brother [[D-Shot]] in the group Most Valuable Players. After impressing fellow students with a rap remix of the school song and a Grambling State talent show, Most Valuable Players released a single, "The King's Men".<ref name="allmusic click">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-click-mn0000765587/biography|title=The Click Biography|last=LeRoy|first=Dan|publisher=allmusic|access-date=January 14, 2021}}</ref><ref name="spotlight" /> The group later became [[The Click]] and released the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Let's Side'' in 1990.<ref name="allmusic" /> The EP was co-produced by Mike Mosley and Al Eaton and was released on Sick Wid It Records, an independent label founded by E-40. In 1992 they released a second album, ''[[Down and Dirty (album)|Down and Dirty]]'', and in 1993 E-40 made his solo album debut. ''Federal'', a nine-track LP/14-track CD produced by Studio Ton and released by Sick Wid It Records in association with SMG (Solar Music Group), a regional distributor.

In 1993 the Click had mainstream hit, "[[Captain Save a Hoe]]" (radio edit "Captain Save Them Thoe"). They moved back to [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] and teamed up with D-Shot, E-40's brother, to form the group MVP or Most Valuable Players. E-40's gospel singing uncle (Saint Charles) helped them put out the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/blog/articles/2005/10/10/left-side|title=Left Side|website=Thefader.com|access-date=January 12, 2015}}</ref> Suga-T was then added to the group to form [[the Click]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westcoast2k.net/interviews/blegit.htm|title=Worship the B|website=Westcoast2k.net|access-date=January 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030224015315/http://www.westcoast2k.net/interviews/blegit.htm|archive-date=February 24, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> Synonymous with Bay Area rap, E-40 garnered a regional following, and eventually a national one, with his flamboyant raps, while his entrepreneurial spirit, embodied by his homegrown record label, Sick Wid It Records, did much to cultivate a flourishing rap scene to the east of San Francisco Bay, in communities such as Oakland and his native Vallejo. Along with [[Too Short]], [[Spice 1]], and [[Ant Banks]], E-40 was among the first West Coast rappers to sign a major-label deal, penning a deal with Jive Records in 1994, after years of releasing music independently. Thus, six additional solo albums were to follow, beginning with ''[[In a Major Way]]'' in 1995 as well as remastered versions of E-40's independent Sick Wid It recordings from previous years. ''In a Major Way'' was regionally well-received, with guest spots by such rappers as [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[Mac Mall]], as well as his son [[Droop-E]].

Although having a large following on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], E-40 did not have a large mainstream audience, so only two of his songs released under Jive Records, "[[1-Luv]]" featuring Levitti and "Things'll Never Change" featuring [[Bo-Roc]], charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="allmusic" /> He had been working nearly exclusively with rappers from the Bay Area until 1997, when he released the double disc compilation ''[[Southwest Riders]]'' featuring exclusively rap acts from the Bay Area and the south. His collaboration with southern rappers continued in 1998, when he was given guest appearances on albums by [[Southern hip hop|Southern]] rappers, including ''[[Lost (Eightball album)|Lost]]'' by [[8Ball & MJG|Eightball]], and ''[[MP Da Last Don]]'' by [[Master P]].<ref name="allmusic" />

He is best known for his debut commercial single "[[24 Hours (TeeFlii song)|24 Hours]]" (featuring [[2 Chainz]]), which was released in March 2014. The song was imcluded on his debut studio album, ''Starr'' which was released in 2015 by [[Epic Records]].

== Early life ==
TeeFlii developed an interest in music as a child attending church, drawn to keyboards after seeing how much his grandfather, who was a pastor, paid his [[Organ (instrument)|organ]] players.<ref name="thefader1">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/10/03/gen-f-teeflii-interview/#/0 |title=GEN F: TeeFLii |publisher=The Fader |date=October 3, 2013 |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}</ref> Frequenting his grandfather's church, he learned to play multiple instruments, such as the organ, piano, guitar and drums.<ref name="laweekly1">{{cite web|last=Weiss |first=Jeff |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2013-06-13/music/teeflii-rize-fireworks-dj-mustard/ |title=TeeFlii Starred in Rize. Now He's About the Hottest Underground R&B Singer Going {{pipe}} Los Angeles News and Events |publisher=LA Weekly |date=June 13, 2013 |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}</ref> He played drums for [[Barbra Streisand]] at a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] event. Music helped provide stability in his life, as his mother battled drug addiction throughout his childhood, and he did not know his biological father until his teens. TeeFlii began smoking marijuana at age eight and moved out of his parents' place for good at age thirteen.<ref name="laweekly1"/> He described his childhood self by saying, "I was bad—fighting, stealing. I'd go take your bike, bring it to my backyard, spray-paint it, try to ride it around."<ref name="thefader1"/>

As a teenager, TeeFlii began dancing and [[krumping]], performing under the name Baby Tight Eyez, and earned placement in a few early [[Chris Brown]] music videos as well as appearing in a major role in ''[[Rize (film)|Rize]]'', [[David LaChapelle]]'s 2005 documentary about Los Angeles' Krump scene. After the film was released, by the time he was 19, he had been living at various friends' houses, and after having his first daughter he went through an issue with the mother, where he lost visitation rights. He then started writing songs for other people to "get the vent off" and started seeing a better chance at stability in his life, so he pushed himself as an artist.<ref name="thefader1"/>

He created his stage name partially from his experience in the movie "Rize." He says in an interview, "TeeFLii came from dancing. I was in the Rize movie, and my name in the movie was Baby Tight Eyez. I was under somebody in dancing named Tight Eyez, then I wanted to branch off and do my own thing when I started getting older. I wanted to have my own name and something I could say that I did for myself. I grew up under another dude named Flii Stylz who choreographed for Chris Brown, Usher, Omarion, everybody in the game. I took a liking to him and next thing I knew, I just took the name TeeFLii."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/6xaxzr/meet-teeflii-the-ratchet-prince-of-los-angeles-r-n-b|title=Meet TeeFlii, the Ratchet Prince of Los Angeles R&B|last=Capell|first=Frances|date=April 2, 2013|website=Noisey|access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref>

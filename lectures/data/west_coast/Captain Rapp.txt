==History==
Glenn's musical career started in 1981 when he was signed to a small [[Independent record label|indie label]] called [[Rappers Rapp Records]]. His first record, party-oriented, "Gigolo Rapp" was a minor hit on the East Coast yet the record failed in his home state.<ref name=AMGBi/>

In 1983, his most successful single "Bad Times" came out on Saturn Records and reached number 23 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Club Play Singles|Dance Charts]].<ref name=Allmusic/> The single was arranged and performed by emerging [[Contemporary R&B]] moguls [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]].<ref name=AMGBi/> with Rich Cason.

In 1992, Glenn recorded a sequel to his previous hit single, titled "Bad Times, Part 2: The Continuance."<ref name=AMGBi/>

===Themes===
"Bad Times" lyrically touches sensitive topics, including [[unemployment]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[AIDS]], [[Salvadoran Civil War]] and even [[nuclear war]], in contrast to uptempo [[synth-funk]] melody and soulful vocals.<ref name="future">{{Cite book|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas |year=1998|title=Getting Present as an Art: Predicting the future: an introduction to the theory of forecasting |publisher=SUNY Press|page=49|isbn=0-7914-3554-7}}</ref>

The song is a West Coast variant of "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" whereas the title is lampooning a name of the most sampled song in [[hip hop|hip-hop]] history, "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]" by [[Chic (band)|Chic]].<ref name="salary"/><ref name="message"/>

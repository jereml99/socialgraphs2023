==Early life==
Introduced to gospel and soul by his father, a preacher and choir director, he began his performance career at age seven by starring in plays and musicals including ''[[The Wiz]]'', ''Oliver With a Twist'', and ''[[Dreamgirls]]'' at Amazing Grace Conservatory. "I grew up as a full-fledged entertainer rather than just somebody trying to rap about stuff," he has said about that experience.<ref>Esteban Serrano / Freddie Jackson, "[http://www.fuse.tv/videos/2016/11/rapper-buddy-interview-shine-video PHARRELL-SIGNED RAPPER BUDDY TALKS 'SHINE' VIDEO & NEW ALBUM: 'I JUST FEEL LIKE A LIGHT WALKING AROUND']," Fuse, 21 November 2016 (retrieved 22 May 2017)</ref> When the school became too expensive he withdrew, later attending a high school performing arts program in [[Long Beach, California]].

==Musical career==
===2009–2015: Career beginnings and signing to Star Trak===
As a teenager he began recording his own material. In 2009, he got a break when TV music supervisor Scott Vener showed [[Pharrell Williams]] an early effort by the 15-year-old Buddy. Impressed, Pharrell began to work with the teenager, and signed him to his [[I Am Other]] creative collective and record label.<ref>XXL Staff, "[http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2011/10/pharrell-introduces-his-new-artist-buddy-premieres-video/ Pharrell Introduces His New Artist Buddy, Premieres Video]," XXL Magazine, 20 October 2011 (retrieved 19 May 2017)</ref> When Buddy was 18, his "Awesome Awesome" was produced by [[The Neptunes]] and Pharrell made an appearance in the video.

On March 28, 2012 he released the single "Staircases" produced by Pharrell and featuring [[Kendrick Lamar]].<ref>Rose Lilah, "[http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/buddy-pharrell-s-artist-staircases-prod-pharrell-song.755823.html Buddy - Staircases Feat.

In 2014, continuing to work with Pharrell, he released his debut mixtape, ''Idle Time'', which featured Kendrick Lamar, [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Freddie Gibbs]], [[Robin Thicke]], [[Sir Michael Rocks]], and others, with production from Pharrell Williams, [[Chuck Inglish]], [[Boi-1da]], [[Cardo]], [[Blaq]], and Polyester among others.<ref>Rose Lilah, "[http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/buddy-idle-time-new-mixtape.108963.html Buddy - Idle Time (New Mixtape)]," Hot New HipHop, 24 February 2014 (retrieved 18 May 2017)</ref>

He then embarked on a series of collaborations with various artists, including [[Nipsey Hussle]], [[BJ The Chicago Kid]], [[Chance the Rapper]], [[Wiz Khalifa]], and [[A$AP Rocky]].

===2016–17: ''Ocean & Montana'' and ''Magnolia''===

It was premiered by hip-hop/R&B tastemaker Carl Chery, with a video directed by Andy Hines featuring a cameo from [[Nipsey Hussle]]. The song garnered over 2.7 million streams on [[Spotify]], 12 million on [[Apple Music]], and nearly half a million views on [[YouTube]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Buddy described the single as "a ghetto hymn acknowledging inevitable death while showing gratitude for abundant life."<ref>Lakin Starling, "[http://www.thefader.com/2016/11/15/buddy-shine-video Buddy Wants To Beam While He’s Still Here In The “Shine” Video]," The Fader, 15 November 2016 (retrieved 19 May 2017)</ref> On August 17, he released his second EP ''Magnolia'' which included features from Boogie, Wiz Khalifa, and Kent Jamz.

His EP ''Ocean & Montana'', produced by the Haitian-Canadian DJ and producer [[Kaytranada]], was released May 19, 2017 by Cool LIL Company. It featured the single "Find Me." The EP's title refers to the intersection in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] where he lived, sought inspiration, and began collaborating with [[Kaytranada]] after leaving his parents' home.<ref>Lakin Starling, "[http://www.thefader.com/2017/05/19/buddy-find-me-video Buddy Floats In His Quest For Solace In The "Find Me" Video]," The Fader, 19 May 2017 (retrieved 19 May 2017)</ref>

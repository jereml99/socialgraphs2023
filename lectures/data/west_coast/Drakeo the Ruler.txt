==Career==
After recording a handful of mixtapes with much more of a [[trap music|trap]] influence than the [[West Coast hip hop]] he became known for, he was discovered by [[Mustard (record producer)|DJ Mustard]], who remixed his song "Mr. Get Dough". The song, which premiered on [[WorldStarHipHop]] in April 2015, became his breakout song,<ref name=LAT/> and has amassed over 6.2 million [[YouTube]] views as of August 2019. Six months later, in October, Drakeo released his official debut mixtape, ''I Am Mr. Mosely'', as his first project under DJ Mustard's 10 Summers label.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/drakeo-the-ruler-i-am-mr-mosley-new-mixtape.116078.html|title=I Am Mr. Mosley|first=Rose|last=Lilah|date=16 October 2015|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref>

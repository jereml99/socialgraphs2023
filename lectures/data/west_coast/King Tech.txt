==Career==
DJ King Tech started off in the Hip Hop game as a B-Boy in the bay area. He initially joined the musical crews “Master City Breakers” and “Flynamic Force” and performed with them. By the time he met [[Sway Calloway]], b-boy crews were fading fast in the face of Hip Hop culture.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://allhiphop.com/2014/09/30/sway-calloway-crooked-i-king-tech-annouce-new-aspiring-rapper-competition-one-shot/ | title=Crooked I, Sway & King Tech Announce New Aspiring Rapper Competition Show "One Shot" | publisher=Allhiphop | date=30 September 2014 | first=Yohance| last=Kyles}}</ref> With King Tech on the 1’s and 2’s and Sway on the mic the duo represented Flynamic Force on their debut single, “We Wanna Rock You.” It sold 20000 singles in the bay area. The second single “Follow For Now” sold over 40,000 singles.

The duo were well known on the local scene<ref>Entzminger, Angela. [http://theanimatorsjournal.blogspot.com/2007/04/office-of-film-theater-and-broadcasting.html Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting Hosts Second Annual Careers in Television Event] The Animator's Journal: April 28, 2007.</ref> and rather than joining any record, they started their own business venture, All City Records. This allowed Tech and Sway to independently release their music albums. The success of their indie 12" “Follow 4 Now/Time 4 Peace” resulted in a major label deal with [[Giant Records (independent)|Giant Records]] and their subsequent LP "Concrete Jungle".

Upon entering and winning a local competition, the duo were given a one-shot deal for a 40-minute mix on local radio station [[KMEL|106.1 KMEL]]. Radio execs realized that the show can be a success with DJ King Tech on the mix and Sway as the front man. The show was named The Wake Up Show, featured music and interviews with well-known hip hop artists as well as up-and-coming ones.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/684158/wake-up-show-online-rap-battle/ | title=Wake Up Show Online Rap Battle | publisher=G4tv | date=2 April 2008 | first=Frank| last=Meyer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://allhiphop.com/2013/10/07/the-world-famous-wakeup-show-gets-unplugged/ | title=The World Famous "Wake Up Show" Gets Unplugged | publisher=Allhiphop | date=7 October 2013 | first=Skyy| last=Hook}}</ref> The show became very popular and later became NYC’s premiere Hip Hop outlet which aided [[Eminem]] to get his start at a very early stage.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/20-insanely-great-eminem-tracks-only-hardcore-fans-know-20150922/sway-king-tech-feat-eminem-freestyle-1999-20150922 | title=20 Insanely Great Eminem Tracks Only Hardcore Fans Know | publisher=Rollingstone | accessdate=22 September 2015 | author=Mosi Reeves, Simon Vozick-Levinson}}</ref><ref name="wakeup">{{Cite web |url=http://www.wakeupshow.com/about.html |title=Wake Up Show about page |access-date=2016-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813024336/http://www.wakeupshow.com/about.html |archive-date=2016-08-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> King Tech is also noted for helping out [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Jay Z]]’s career in their early stages.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.1696/title.how-sway-king-techs-this-or-that-introduced-eminem-tech-n9ne-crooked-i | title=How Sway & King Tech's "This Or That" Introduced Eminem, Tech N9ne & Crooked I | publisher=Hiphopdx | date=11 May 2011 | first=Jake| last=Paine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://kmel.iheart.com/onair/bigvon-1044/king-tech-talks-eminems-freestyling-crooked-14955683/ | title=King Tech talks Eminem's freestyling & Crooked I making a whole album in one flight | date=28 July 2016}}</ref> The duo from The Bay Area were changing the face of not just urban radio but popular music in general and the way that it was played and appreciated on regular FM dials across the planet.

The popularity of the show helped duo in getting another major label record deal with  Interscope Records. The album, This or That, reached #30 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #1 on the Top Heatseekers chart in 1999.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p22006|pure_url=yes}} Sway & King Tech singles charts history] at [[Allmusic]]</ref>

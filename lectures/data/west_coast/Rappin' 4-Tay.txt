=="Playaz Club" Controversy==

In 2014, 4-Tay spoke out against [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] for using lyrics from 4-Tay's 1994 song "Playaz Club" in the collaboration "[[Who Do You Love? (YG song)|Who Do You Love?]]" with [[YG (rapper)|YG]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.26851/title.rappin-4-tay-blasts-drake-over-verse-on-yg-s-who-do-you-love-|title=Rappin' 4-Tay Blasts Drake Over Verse On YG's "Who Do You Love"|last=Baker|first=Soren|work=[[HipHopDX]]|publisher=Cheri Media Group|date=2 January 2014|access-date=30 January 2023}}</ref>  The artists settled out of court with 4-Tay being promised $100,000<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gordon |first1=Jeremy |title=Drake Pays $100,000 to Rappin' 4-Tay for Ripping Off "Playaz Club" Lyrics on YG's "Who Do You Love" |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/55924-drake-pays-100000-to-rappin-4-tay-for-ripping-off-playaz-club-lyrics-on-ygs-who-do-you-love/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=30 January 2023 |date=16 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DRAKE 'Playaz Club' Beef Settled PAYS $100K FOR BORROWED LYRICS |url=https://www.tmz.com/2014/07/16/drake-who-do-you-love-rappin-4-tay-playaz-club-stolen-lyrics-settlement/ |website=[[TMZ]] |access-date=30 January 2023 |date=16 July 2014}}</ref> and future credits for the song. However, it was later revealed that Drake had not actually paid 4-Tay the $100,000.<ref name=NeverPaid>{{cite news |last1=Voynovskaya |first1=Nastia |title=Drake Never Paid Rappin' 4-Tay For Stolen Lyrics, Manager Says |url=https://www.kqed.org/arts/13845996/four-years-after-drake-dispute-rappin-4-tays-song-royalties-are-for-sale |access-date=30 January 2023 |publisher=[[KQED Inc.|KQED]] |date=30 November 2018}}</ref>

4-Tay eventually received royalties for his contributions to "Who Do You Love?". In 2018, the royalties to both the YG single and "Playaz Club" were auctioned on Royalty Exchange and at one time had bids of upward of $38,250 with the seller reportedly being 4-Tay.<ref name=NeverPaid/>

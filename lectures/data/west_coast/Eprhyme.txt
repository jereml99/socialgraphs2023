== Early life ==
Eden Pearlstein was born February 19, 1980, in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. He grew up in a [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] household, later describing it as "a standard non-[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] West Coast Jewish upbringing—[[Hebrew school]], [[bar mitzvah]], and summer camp. It was not very intriguing to me and I just walked away from it after my bar mitzvah."<ref name="jc">{{cite web | url=http://www.thejc.com/arts/music/28710/the-orthodox-rapper-mashing-culture | title=The Orthodox rapper mashing up culture | publisher=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=Feb 25, 2010 | accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref> Pearlstein listened to hip hop as a child and began rapping when he was 14.<ref name=jc /> During his middle school years, he became rebellious and dabbled in drugs and petty crime until, at age 17, he attended a youth arts program and became interested in poetry.

===Solo career===

Pearlstein gained the attention of [[K Records]], which released his first two solo singles, "[[Punklezmerap]]", which featured [[Nomy Lamm]] on vocals, and "Shomer Salaam". This made him the label's first hip hop artist in a decade, as they were primarily associated with [[punk rock|punk]] and [[indie rock]] artists.<ref name="jewcy">{{cite web | url=http://www.jewcy.com/arts-and-culture/blame_it_mamamamamanischewitz | title=Blame it on the Ma-Ma-Ma-Ma-Manischewitz | publisher=[[Jewcy]] | date=July 24, 2009 | accessdate=20 August 2015 | author=Dobbins, Geoffrey}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.northwestmilitary.com/music-and-culture/walkie-talkie-blog/2008/02/K-Records-goes-hip-hop/print/ | title=K Records goes hip-hop | publisher=[[Weekly Volcano]] | date=Feb 27, 2008 | accessdate=20 August 2015 | author=Allen, Brad}}</ref>

=== Darshan, Chant Records, and Ruthless Cosmopolitans ===
{{Main|Darshan (band)}}
While attending a retreat at [[Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center]] in 2008, Pearlstein met rabbi and singer-songwriter [[Shir Yaakov]]. The two subsequently formed the [[alternative hip hop]] collective [[Darshan (band)|Darshan]], and in 2009 they released a debut EP, ''Lishmah'', through [[Erez Safar]]'s Shemspeed label. A debut full-length, ''Deeper and Higher'', was released independently in 2015, with [[Jamie Saft]] producing and contributions from drummer [[Ben Perowsky]] and vocalists [[Basya Schechter]] and Elana Brody, the former of whom became a full-time member of the group. In 2017 they signed to the independent label Chant Records (founded by guitarist/producer [[Jon Madof]] and bassist/oudist [[Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz]]) and released a second album, ''Raza'', with Pearlstein and Schecter, producer Frederik Rubens, and backing musicians including Blumenkranz, [[Jessica Lurie]], [[Jason Lindner]], and Schechter's [[Pharaoh's Daughter]] bandmates Mathias Kunzli, Noah Hoffeld, and Daniel Freedman.

In late 2020 Pearlstein formed another group, Ruthless Cosmopolitans, with Madof, guitarist [[Yoshie Fruchter]], and drummer Emmanuel "Manny" Laine ([[Wyclef Jean]], [[Kanye West]]). The idea for the group originated in August 2017 when Pearlstein wrote the song "Make America Hate Again" in the wake of the infamous [[Unite the Right rally]] and brought it to Madof.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Andrei Cherascu|date=2020-12-03|title=Where is the human in all of this? — Eden Pearlstein and Jon Madof present their new project, Ruthless Cosmopolitans|url=https://themusicandmyth.com/2020/12/03/where-is-the-human-in-all-of-this-eden-pearlstein-and-jon-madof-present-their-new-project-ruthless-cosmopolitans/|access-date=2021-12-05|website=The Music and Myth|language=en}}</ref> After releasing two music videos, "The Screen Age" on September 21 and "Make America Hate Again" on October 12, the group released a self-titled EP on October 23, 2020. Produced by Madof, the EP featured contributions from vocalists Elana Brody and Talia Madof and [[Zion80]] members Greg Wall, [[Frank London]], Brian Marsella, and Marlon Sobol.

Since 1991, he has been one of two lead rappers in the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Cypress Hill]], along with [[Sen Dog]]. He has also been a part of the [[rap metal]] band [[Kush (band)|Kush]] (2000–2002), the hip hop supergroup [[Serial Killers (musical group)|Serial Killers]] (2013–present) and the [[rap rock]] supergroup [[Prophets of Rage]] (2016–2019). He has released a variety of solo [[mixtape]]s, as well as two solo albums: ''[[Smoke n Mirrors]]'' (2009) and ''Tell You Something'' (2020).

==Early life==
Born in Los Angeles to a Mexican father and a Cuban mother, B-Real moved with his sister and mother out of his father's home to [[South Gate, California]] at the age of five. He later lived in [[Bell, California]]. Before dropping out of [[Bell High School (Bell, California)|Bell High School]], he befriended future [[Cypress Hill]] members [[Sen Dog]] and [[Mellow Man Ace]] (who later left the group to go solo) and became an active member of the Family Swan [[Bloods]], known as the Neighborhood Family Bloods at that time. At the age of 17, Freese was shot in a gang-related shooting with a hollow-point .22 caliber bullet, which punctured his lung.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unitedgangs.com/sinister-rapper/|title=Sinister (Rapper)|date=September 14, 2015|access-date=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sherwood.it/articolo/672/cypress-hills-b-real-psycho-realm-soul-assassinslaM|title=Cypress Hill's B-Real + Psycho Realm (Soul Assassins/L.A.)|access-date=December 19, 2017}}</ref> B Real was married to his long time girlfriend in August of 2008 in Los Angeles, California. They have one daughter together (born in 2010). He also has an adult son, from a previous relationship.

==Musical career==
After being introduced to [[DJ Muggs]] by Julio G the [[KDAY]] Mixmaster, B-Real and Sen gained interest in Muggs's concept of an album based on experiences from Cypress Ave in South Gate. The group was signed with Ruffhouse/Columbia records in 1991 and released their influential debut album, ''[[Cypress Hill (album)|Cypress Hill]]'', that year. B-Real would use fictional stories telling of life-threatening experiences as material for the group's debut album, and subsequent releases.

While working on their first album, B-Real developed his distinctive high-pitched, nasal rap style. Previously, he had rapped with something like his normal voice, but DJ Muggs told him that his rap delivery was boring and warned him that, unless he changed it, he would be overshadowed by Sen Dog. B-Real took inspiration from hip hop pioneer [[Rammellzee]], who had occasionally rapped in a high-pitched voice. B-Real initially saw the high voice as a silly gimmick, but was surprised at the positive feedback he got for his new style and decided to keep going with it.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Secret to B-Real's Distinct Voice {{!}} Joe Rogan |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWkIzhH-us |date=April 23, 2019 |publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

Cypress Hill's self-titled debut album was a critical and commercial hit, selling 2 million copies, and their follow-up album, 1993's ''[[Black Sunday (Cypress Hill album)|Black Sunday]]'', was an even bigger hit, debuting at #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and eventually selling 3.4 million copies. They became the first Latin rap group to have platinum and multi-platinum albums, and remain the best-selling Latin rap group of all time.<ref name="SALES">[http://de.click2music.co.uk/3rd/Prezence/cypress_hill/index.html "Greatest Hits From the Bong Out"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928034052/http://de.click2music.co.uk/3rd/Prezence/cypress_hill/index.html |date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref> In a 2010 interview, B-Real stated: "Fortunately I guess the fact we were able to achieve what we achieved, being Latino but without really exploiting that side of it, showed like a whole generation behind us how you could have that success without being labeled as just one thing. Because back in the day, when you were labeled 'a Latino rapper', the record companies would only try to market you to that Latin fan-base which didn't really exist yet!... So yeah, it feels good to see people recognizing us as some of the pioneers that opened the doors for a lot of these other Latino rappers to come through."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/528/cypress_hill_rise_and_shine/|title=Cypress Hill: Rise & Shine|first=Stephen Clark -|last=Design|access-date=August 26, 2016}}</ref>

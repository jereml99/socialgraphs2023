== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Mahoney was born in [[Upland, California]] and raised in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. He started out in a Las Vegas-based band, 187, and was also an original member of the bands Spade Brigade and OPM, as well as a co-founder of Controversy Sells.

=== With Suburban Noize ===
DJ Bobby B, [[D Loc]], and [[Johnny Richter]] of the [[Kottonmouth Kings]] first met Mahoney through [[freestyle motocross]] events. They praised Mahoney and his band [[OPM (band)|OPM]] to the owners of Suburban Noize, including [[Daddy X]], who listened to OPM and were impressed. However, the band was already signed to a major label, [[Atlantic Records]].

Mahoney decided to sign a deal with Suburban Noize, and the following week met [[Mellow Man Ace]] and Bronek while in the studio. Ace from [[Ice-T]]'s team visited the Suburban Noize office and heard some of Mahoney's work, expressing his interest. This resulted in the release of Mahoney's debut solo album, ''[[High Class White Trash]]'', on Suburban Noize Records in 2004.

Since then, Mahoney has released several albums, including three with OPM, and has also collaborated with [[The Dirtball]] and [[Subnoize Souljaz]]. In addition, he was featured on the track "Keep It Simple" for [[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]]'s album, ''[[Clockwork Gray]]''.

Mahoney also collaborated with The Dirtball on a track called "Check Royalty" for the compilation ''When There's No More Room In Hell Volume 1'', released on SugarDaddy Records, an independent label headed by [[Daddy Long Legs (musician)|Daddy Long Legs]].

In 2009, Mahoney released a duet with Scott Russo from [[Unwritten Law]] called "Sinner", which peaked at #23 on Billboard's [[Alternative Songs]].

His 2010 album ''[[Good Times & Bad Advice]]'' included guest appearances from [[Everlast]], [[Cisco Adler]], and Scott Russo. The album's title track was used in promotional material for [[Madison Square Gardens]].

Mahoney has also appeared as a regular cast member on the A&E television series ''Inked'', focusing on his work at the Hart & Huntington Tattoo Company in Las Vegas. In 2007, he appeared on the [[Vans Warped]] tour.

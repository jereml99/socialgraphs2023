==Career==

===Musical style===
Although often credited as being a major pioneer and even the main creator of the [[horrorcore]] rap genre, Mann himself has claimed that his style is less literally “horrorcore” and instead falls more directly under his own distinct category or sub-category of rap called rip gut, which specifically emphasizes (usually) graphic violence.

The ripgut genre itself reportedly stemmed from his love of [[meat]], but this lyrical style is also sometimes considered to be either associated with or connected to the common thoughts and feelings occasionally experienced during [[Mania|manic]] and/or violent states of mind brought on by the use of certain illicit drugs such as [[phencyclidine]] (PCP).

===1993-2002: Black Market Records===
In 1993{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} [[Black Market Records]] released Mann's first EP, ''[[24 Deep]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.murderdog.com/archives/brothalynch/brothalynch.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326171405/http://www.murderdog.com/archives/brothalynch/brothalynch.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 26, 2006 |title=Interview with Brotha Lynch Hung |work=Murder Dog Magazine |access-date=January 15, 2010 }}</ref> followed by an album every year or two: ''[[Season of da Siccness]]'' in 1995,<ref name="sods">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r209314|pure_url=yes}}|title=Season of da Siccness > Review|last=Henderson|first=Alex|year=2006|website=allmusic|access-date=June 1, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Loaded (Brotha Lynch Hung album)|Loaded]]'' in 1997, ''[[EBK4]]'' and the soundtrack to the [[horror comedy]] film ''Now Eat'' in 2000,<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/brotha-lynch-hung-presents-now-eat-the-album-mw0000432224 album</ref> ''[[The Virus (album)|The Virus]]'' in 2001, and three compilations, ''[[Appearances: Book 1]]'', ''Remains: Book II'', and ''[[Book III]]'', in 2002.

==Controversy==
In September 1996, Joseph Edward "Bubba" Gallegos, an 18-year-old man from [[Bayfield, Colorado]], killed his friends after listening repeatedly to Brotha Lynch Hung's song "Locc 2 da Brain". He was in turn killed by police. His minister suggested that the music played a role in the killings.<ref name="Gallegos">{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-27/news/mn-48081_1_joseph-edward-gallegos | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=J.R. | last1=Moehringer | first2=Michael G. | last2=Wagner | title=O.C.

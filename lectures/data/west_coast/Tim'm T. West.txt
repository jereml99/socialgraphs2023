==Early life and education==
West was born with a [[speech impediment]] that caused him to [[stutter]] and repeat the 'M' on his first name.<ref>[http://timmwest.bandcamp.com/track/stutter stutter]</ref><ref name="revolution"/> His family began calling him "Tim'm" which has remained his moniker.<ref name="prideindex">[http://www.prideindex.com/wpcms/?p=4362 The One Loved Best, An Interview with Tim’M West | Prideindex<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He is the second son of nine children, born into a musical family in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] to Charles Edward, a minister, and his mother, Irma Pearl Stinson, who served at various times as an administrative assistant and nurse.<ref name="thebody">[http://www.thebody.com/content/art1162.html One-on-One With Tim'm West - TheBody.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He counts his mother as one of the biggest influences on his life, showing him how to be thankful, loving, forgiving, and [[gracious]].<ref name="thebody"/> His early influences besides his family were [[reggae]], [[rap]] and [[house music]].<ref name="clatl">[http://clatl.com/atlanta/timm-west-rhymes-with-homo-side/Content?oid=1273547 Tim'm West: Rhymes with homo side | Music Feature | Creative Loafing Atlanta<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He says his dad was more of a storefront preacher with mixed success, but it did offer the first times West recalls being a poet, and performing.<ref name="prideindex"/> West grew up primarily in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] and later [[Taylor, Arkansas]] in extreme poverty, where he attended Taylor High School.<ref name="revolution"/><ref name="thebody"/> He served as captain of his high school [[basketball]] team and president of his school's chapter of [[Future Farmers of America]].

He participated in [[Upward Bound]] at [[Southern Arkansas University]] and competed in the National Science Competitions where he was twice selected to represent his state at the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium. He met then-Governor [[Bill Clinton]] and traveled to [[The United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] to compete. He was interviewed by West Point recruiters, but after revealing he had [[Men who have sex with men|same-sex]] interests, he was dropped as a potential recruit. West is now openly [[queer]].<ref name="revolution"/><ref>[http://newblackman.blogspot.com/2012/07/deepdickollective-co-founder-timm-west.html NewBlackMan (in Exile): DeepDickollective Co-Founder Tim'm West on Frank Ocean<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

His activity as a [[Boy Scout]] led him to join [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) which sponsored his troop. He began attending LDS Church functions at the age of twelve. While being considered for a Mormon mission, he [[came out]] to his [[Bishop]], which heightened his existing feelings of rejection and [[shame]]. This was a difficult for him, and he contemplated his future, as well as [[suicide]]. He struggled with depression and [[anxiety]]. He decided to move on to attend college, accept himself, even if uncertain about what his future held. His tireless work as a high school student enabled many opportunities for college, Cornell University and Duke University among others.

West enrolled at [[Duke University]], in [[Durham, North Carolina]], and used an opportunity while at Duke, to attend [[Howard University]] in his senior year to experience and study at a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historical black college]].<ref name="revolution">[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2005/4-29/arts/feature/revolution.cfm "The Deliberate Revolutionary,"]
''Washington Blade'', April 29, 2005. (archive at [http://www.reddirt.biz/pdfs/TheDeliberateRevolutionary.pdf])</ref> He returned to complete his studies at Duke, and graduated in 1994, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[philosophy]], with a concentration in [[women's studies]] and [[pre-law]].<ref name="revolution"/> After a few years working as a college admissions officer at Duke, he moved to [[New York City]] to attend [[The New School for Social Research]] where he earned a Masters of Arts degree in [[liberal studies]] and philosophy in 1998, while immersing himself in the [[spoken word]] and [[poetry]] scene in Brooklyn and Manhattan.<ref name="revolution"/><ref name=Chiread/> He later earned a master's in modern thought and literature from [[Stanford University]].<ref name="revolution"/>

==Deep Dickollective/hip hop==
West traveled to the west coast, enrolling in a Ph.D. program in interdisciplinary modern thought and literature at [[Stanford University]].<ref name="revolution"/> Shortly thereafter in 1999, he discovered that he had AIDS,<ref name=Chiread/> so he took an academic break to focus on his health and options for his future.<ref name="revolution"/><ref name="clatl"/> It was during this time that he started youth advocacy work and joined forces in early 2000 with [[Juba Kalamka]], and Phillip Atiba Goff to form the black and [[homohop|queer hip-hop]] group [[Deep Dickollective]] (DDC).<ref name=autogenerated6 /> West believes the [[Bay Area]], with San Francisco's AIDS [[activism]], and Oakland's [[Black Panthers]], was one of the few settings where DDC could emerge.<ref name=Chiread/> The "idea of pan-Africanism and black nationalism is also kind of working against progay [causes]. It's one of the few places were those two identities converge."<ref name=Chiread/> DDC was one of the first groups of their kind.<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=Chiread/> They were formed, in part, as a response to the pandemic of HIV/AIDS among queer black men.<ref name="revolution"/> Curator William Jones booked them as part of his "Black Gay Male Radical Performances" series at the Black Dot Café in [[Oakland, California]]. Their debut recording "BourgieBohoPostPomoAfroHomo" surprised hip
hop and spoken word communities, with a fresh approach to the political and social issues, from a perspective of an increasingly vocal black and [[queer]] community.<ref name=autogenerated6 /> What started as a [[parody|parodic]] exercise became an underground, and critical success.<ref name=autogenerated6 /> West continues to educate on [[homophobia]] in hip hop.<ref>[http://www.dallasvoice.com/timm-west-speaks-utd-queerly-speaking-1049295.html Tim’m West speaks at UTD and then Queerly Speaking | Dallas Voice<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> West coined the term ''homohop'' but feels that the term should be replaced.<ref name="dot429">{{Cite web |url=http://dot429.com/articles/1645-homo-hop-is-dead-queer-hip-hop-is-the-real-deal |title=Homo Hop is dead, Queer hip hop is the real deal |access-date=2014-01-04 |archive-date=2013-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317020626/http://dot429.com/articles/1645-homo-hop-is-dead-queer-hip-hop-is-the-real-deal |url-status=dead }}</ref> At first it helped organize [[LGBTQI]] hip hop artists, but he feels now it serves to separate artists who are fundamentally just hip hop artists.<ref name="dot429"/>

West is featured prominently in the 2005 hip hop documentary, ''[[Pick Up the Mic]]'' and appears in Byron Hurt's documentary ''[[Beyond Beats and Rhymes]]''. Most recently he appeared in a set of documentaries directed by [[Mario Van Peebles]] about black manhood and responsibility; ''Bring Your 'A' Game'' and its complement, ''Fair Game?'' In Spring of 2007, DDC released its final, full-length studio project, ''On Some Other'', on Sugartruck Recordings. The group disbanded in 2007. DDC was a part of ''The Anthology of Rap'' book from [[Yale University Press]] in 2010. West credits DDC for breaking through the media as queer and black artists, and enabling him to perform as an out LGBT black soloist, "We had pretty much remained invisible in the media prior to Deep Dickollective, so the affect was far-reaching."<ref name="prideindex"/>

As a solo artist, West released ''Songs from Red Dirt'' on Cellular Records in 2004.<ref name="revolution"/><ref>[http://timmwest.bandcamp.com/album/songs-from-red-dirt Songs from Red Dirt]"</ref> The debut provided musical complement to his first book, ''Red Dirt Revival: a poetic memoir in 6 Breaths'' (2003).<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref name="revolution"/><ref>"[https://www.amazon.com/Red-Dirt-Revival-Poetic-Breaths/dp/0972658408 Red Dirt Revival: a poetic memoir in 6 Breaths]."</ref><ref>Tompkins, Kyla Wazana.

In 2005 he released a [[chapbook]], ''BARE: Notes From a Porchdweller''.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> ''Flirting'' (2007), was his second full-length poetic memoir book.<ref name="clatl"/> Also in 2007 he completed his second solo album, ''Blakkboy Blue(s)'', which was met with positive critical response.<ref name="clatl"/><ref>" [http://timmwest.bandcamp.com/album/blakkboy-blue-s Blakkboy Blue(s)]"</ref> In the Fall of 2008, and in support of the campaign against California's [[Proposition 8]], West created a limited edition chapbook ''Love In Full Color''. In January 2009, he released a third solo rap project, ''In Security: The Golden Error''.<ref>"[http://timmwest.bandcamp.com/album/in-security-the-golden-error In Security: The Golden Error]"</ref><ref>[http://gmagazinenow.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/album-review-in-security-by-timm-west.html Album Review: "In Security" by Tim'm West - G-Magazine Now<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In July 2011 he released ''Fly Brotha'',<ref name="prideindex"/><ref>"[http://timmwest.bandcamp.com/album/fly-brotha Fly Brotha]"</ref> which also received critical acclaim. His fifth solo release, ''Snapshots: The He-Art and Experience of Tim'm T. West'', was released in April 2013.<ref name=Chiread/><ref>"[http://timmwest.bandcamp.com/album/snapshots-the-he-art-and-experience-of-timm-t-west Snapshots]: The He-Art and Experience of Tim'm T. West"</ref>

West continues to host "Front Porch,"<ref>'[http://www.reddirt.biz/thefrontporch.htm Front Porch]'</ref> a spoken word/hip-hop/[[soul music|soul]] showcase that has appeared at various colleges and universities nationwide.<ref name="revolution"/><ref name="clatl"/> He continues to teach and perform nationally, promoting a collection of poetry released in April 2015, "pre|dispositions: affirmations on loving" and a new Hip-Hop/Soul/House project, "ICONography," which was released in October 2015.

==Educator==
West worked in HIV/AIDS advocacy awareness and mobilization, specializing his work for young black [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[same gender loving]] men at both AID Atlanta and Saint Hope Foundation's FUSION Center in [[Houston, Texas]].<ref>Malebranche, David J., et al. "The relationship between gender role conflict and condom use among black MSM." AIDS and Behavior 16.7 (2012): 2051–2061.</ref> He has been recognized for his work over multiple years with the [[National Association of People with AIDS]]'s "Positive Youth Institute," and his graduation as a distinguished fellow of the Black AIDS Institute's "African-American HIV University's Community Mobilization College."<ref>Bailey, Marlon M. "Performance as intravention: Ballroom culture and the politics of HIV/AIDS in Detroit." Souls 11.3 (2009): 253-274.</ref>

West served as the Department Chair of English and Creative Writing at the [[Oakland School of the Arts]] from 2002 to 2004 before relocating to [[Washington, DC]] where he taught in the English Department of the [[Cesar Chavez Public Charter High School]]. In various capacities, since 1995, West has also worked for [[College Summit]], notably as a high school coordinator in DC in 2006 and 2007, where he helped to the build capacity of high
schools to get more of their students into college. He is known for his engaging teaching methods, and has taught on the post-secondary level as an instructor of Writing Pedagogy classes at [[Eugene Lang College]] of The New School in New York City, and as an instructor in Stanford University's first-year Writing and Critical Thinking Program. In the 2008 to 2009 Academic Year, West taught in the Department of World Languages and Cultures as a Visiting
Lecturer in Ethnic Studies at California's [[Humboldt State University]]. More recently, West served as an adjunct professor of English and Philosophy at [[Houston Community College]], and in the summer of 2011, joined distinguished faculty with the [[Washington National Cathedral]] Scholars Program where he taught a 6-week blog-based [[social justice]]/activism course.

In May 2011, West relocated to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where his daughter, Shannon Rose Matesky, a recent [[DePaul University]] graduate and well known poet, spoken word artist and performer, lives. He started MyWritingProfessor.com where he serves as the owner and principal consultant, and remains a longstanding advocate for youth.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> In December 2012, he accepted a position at the [[Center on Halsted]] where he was swiftly promoted to serve as the director of youth services through May 2014.<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref name=Chiread>[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/center-on-halsted-tim-m-west-deep-dickollective/Content?oid=8822558 Tim'm West and the masculine mystique: In his career as a hip-hop artist—and now through his work at the Center on Halsted—West has demonstrated that there's more than one way to be a black gay man.]</ref> Tim'm's desire to have a broader impact on LGBTQ youth and young adults led his interest in Teach For America, who'd just launched its [http://www.teachforamerica.org/LGBTQ LGBTQ Initiative] and was seeking a managing director. Given the trajectory of his own struggles as a queer black male in the South and even a [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/timm-west/lgbt-teachers_b_5985490.html suicide attempt at sixteen], Tim'm proudly accepted this position with Teach For America in July 2014; a position he feels bridges his work as an educator with his long-standing commitment to LGBTQ youth advocacy. He relocated from Washington, DC to Atlanta, GA where he serves on the Atlanta-based Programming Board for the LGBT Institute. Tim'm was promoted to Senior Managing Director of Teach For America's LGBTQ Community Initiative and continues to do work nationally to advance safer and braver classrooms for LGBTQ kids and educators.

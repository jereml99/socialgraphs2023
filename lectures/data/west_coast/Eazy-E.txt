'''Eric Lynn Wright''' (September 7, 1964{{sfn|Westhoff|2017|p=284|ps=: "Though most obituaries list his birth year as 1963, that is likely not accurate. The funeral program gave his birth year as 1964, as do most official court documents. That would make him thirty at his death, rather than thirty-one as was widely reported"}} &ndash; March 26, 1995), known professionally as '''Eazy-E''', was an American rapper who propelled [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast rap]] and [[gangsta rap]] by leading the group [[N.W.A]] and its label, [[Ruthless Records]]. He is often referred to as the "Godfather of Gangsta Rap".<ref name=":0" />

Born and raised in [[Compton, California]], Wright had several legal troubles before founding Ruthless in 1987.<ref>Vladislav Lyubovny, interview with Lonzo Williams, [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_uDnU3QYKfs&t=21s "Dre & Eazy were supposed to co-own Ruthless Records"], [[DJ Vlad|''DJVlad'']] @ YouTube, August 26, 2015.</ref> After a short solo career with frequent collaboration with [[Ice Cube]] and [[Dr. Dre]], they joined, forming N.W.A, later that year. N.W.A's debut studio album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', was released in 1988. Controversial upon release, it is now ranked among [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the greatest]] and most influential albums ever. The group released its second and final studio album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]'', in 1991, and soon after disbanded.

During N.W.A's splintering, largely by disputes over money, Eazy-E became embroiled in bitter rivalries with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, who had departed for solo careers in 1989 and 1991, respectively. Resuming his solo career Eazy-E released two EPs,<ref name="amg">{{cite web|last=Huey|first= Steve|title=Eazy-E Biography|url= {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p33|pure_url=yes}}|website=Allmusic|year=2003|access-date= August 24, 2007}}</ref> yet he remained more significant behind the scenes, signing and nationally debuting the rap group [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]] from 1993 to 1994. He died from [[HIV/AIDS]]-related illness in 1995.

==Early life and Ruthless Records investment==

Wright supported himself mainly by selling drugs, and introduced his cousin to the illicit occupation.<ref name="dallas">{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2002-09-12/music/straight-outta-left-field/|title=Straight Outta Left Field|date=September 12, 2002|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|access-date=January 6, 2010|archive-date=October 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015115439/http://www.dallasobserver.com/2002-09-12/music/straight-outta-left-field/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Wright's music manager [[Jerry Heller]] recalls seeing Wright selling [[marijuana]], but not [[cocaine]]. Heller would claim that Wright's "dope dealer" label was part of his "self-forged armor".<ref name="Ruthless"/> Wright was also labeled as a "thug". Heller explains: "The hood where he grew up was a dangerous place. He was a small guy. 'Thug' was a role that was widely understood on the street; it gave you a certain level of protection in the sense that people hesitated to fuck with you. Likewise, 'dope dealer' was a role that accorded you certain privileges and respect."<ref name="Ruthless">{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Jerry|title=Ruthless: A Memoir|year=2007|publisher=Gallery|isbn=978-1-4169-1794-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ruthlessmemoir00hell/page/65 65–77]|url=https://archive.org/details/ruthlessmemoir00hell/page/65}}</ref>

In 1986, at age 22, Wright had allegedly earned as much as US$250,000 from dealing drugs. However, after his cousin was shot and killed, he decided that he could make a better living in the Los Angeles hip hop scene, which was growing rapidly in popularity.<ref name="Chang">{{cite web|url=http://swindlemagazine.com/issue02/eazy-e/|title=The Last Days of Eazy E|last=Chang|first=Jeff|work=[[Swindle (magazine)|Swindle]]|date=April 24, 2004|access-date=December 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025012955/http://swindlemagazine.com/issue02/eazy-e/|archive-date=October 25, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> He started recording songs during the mid-1980s in his parents' garage, thus starting Ruthless Records.<ref name="Put Gangsta Rap on Charts"/><ref name="allrapnews.com">{{Cite web|title=Happy 56th Birthday To N.W.A./Ruthless Records Founder Eazy-E!

The original idea for Ruthless Records came when Wright asked Heller to go into business with him. Wright suggested a half-ownership company, but it was later decided that Wright would get eighty percent of the company's income and Heller would only get twenty percent. According to Heller, he told Wright, "Every dollar comes into Ruthless, I take twenty cents. That's industry standard for a manager of my caliber. I take twenty, you take eighty percent. I am responsible for my expenses and you're responsible for yours. You own the company. I work for you."<ref name="Ruthless"/> Along with Heller, Wright invested much of his money into [[Ruthless Records]].<ref>Hunt, Dennis (October 22, 1989).

===End of N.W.A and feud with Dr. Dre (1991–1994)===
N.W.A began to split up after Jerry Heller became the band's manager. Dr. Dre recalls, "The split came when Jerry Heller got involved. He played the divide and conquer game. Instead of taking care of everybody, he picked one nigga to take care of and that was Eazy. And Eazy was like, 'I'm taken care of, so fuck it'." Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. sent [[Suge Knight]] to look into Eazy-E's financial situation as they began to grow suspicious of Eazy-E and Jerry Heller. Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. asked Eazy-E to release them from Ruthless, but Eazy-E refused. The impasse led to what reportedly transpired between Suge Knight and Eazy-E at the recording studio where ''Niggaz4life'' was recorded. After he refused to release Dr. Dre and The D.O.C., Suge Knight told Eazy-E that he had kidnapped Jerry Heller and was holding him prisoner in a van. This did not convince Eazy-E to release Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. from Ruthless, and Suge Knight threatened Eazy-E's family: Suge Knight gave Eazy-E a piece of paper that contained Eazy's mother's address, telling him, "I know where your mama stays." Eazy-E finally signed Dr. Dre and The D.O.C.'s releases, officially ending N.W.A.<ref name="Dre bio">{{cite book|title=Dr. Dre: A Biography|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-33826-4|pages=52–55|author1=Borgmeyer, Jon |author2=Lang, Holly }}</ref>

In 1993, Eazy E regularly attended court in the prosecution of the officers involved in the [[beating of Rodney King]], often standing alongside Theodore J. Briseno, who he had met through sharing the same lawyer.  Eazy E said, "The difference is that most people look at the video and say four white officers were responsible for the beating of this helpless, innocent black man. I say, 'Wrong.' Three white officers were responsible for beating Rodney King. The other officer (Theodore J. Briseno) happens to be Mexican-American, and he tried to stop them."  This caused controversy in the hip-hop community, with [[Willie D]] calling Eazy E a "sellout".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-06-ca-19744-story.html|last=Philips|first=Chuck|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 6, 1993|access-date=December 29, 2020|title=Rapper Takes Officer's Side : Trial: Controversial N.W.A. founder Eazy-E has stood by Theodore J. Briseno at the Rodney King trial. His actions have shocked some in the rap community.}}</ref>

The feud with Dr. Dre continued after a track on Dre's debut album ''[[The Chronic]]'', "[[Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')]]", contained lyrics that insulted Eazy-E. Eazy responded with the [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa]]'', featuring the tracks "[[Real Muthaphuckkin G's]]" and "It's On". The album, which was released on October 25, 1993, contains pictures of Dre wearing "lacy outfits and makeup" when he was a member of the Electro-hop [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]].<ref name="Dre bio"/>

When reviewing ''Str8 off tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton'', [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted "...&nbsp;Eazy-E sounds revitalized, but the music simply isn't imaginative. Instead of pushing forward and creating a distinctive style, it treads over familiar gangsta territory, complete with bottomless bass, whining synthesizers, and meaningless boasts."<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=str8-off-tha-streetz-of-muthaphuin-compton-r229378|pure_url=yes}} |title=Str8 Off tha Streetz of Muthaphu**in Compton&nbsp;– Eazy-E |website=Allmusic |access-date=November 27, 2010}}</ref> When reviewing ''Eazy-Duz-It'', Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic said, "In terms of production, Dr. Dre and Yella meld together P-Funk, Def Jam-style hip-hop and the leftover electro sounds of mid-'80s Los Angeles, creating a dense, funky, and thoroughly unique style of their own." Birchmeier described Eazy-E's style as "dense, unique and funky", and said that it sounded "absolutely revolutionary in 1988".<ref name="allmusic main">{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=eazy-e-p33|pure_url=yes}} |title=Eazy-E |website=Allmusic |access-date=November 27, 2010}}</ref>

Eazy-E was then portrayed by Omari Wallace in the 2016 film ''[[Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge & Michel'le]]''.

==Biography==

In 1996 he and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]] singer-songwriter [[Teedra Moses]] had twin sons, Ras and Taj, both of whom are founding members of the rap group [[Coast Contra]].<ref>[http://allhiphop.com/2007/08/20/teedra-moses-simply-complex-part-two/ Teedra Moses: Simply Complex Part Two] Allhiphop.com</ref><ref>[http://beatsboxingmayhem.com/2008/04/08/teedra-moses-a-conversation-with-the-young-lioness-2008/ Teedra Moses: A Conversation with the Young Lioness (2008)] Beatsboxingmayhem.com</ref> [[Black Mafia Family|BMF]] Entertainment artist Barima "Bleu DaVinci" McKnight is Austin's cousin.<ref>[http://www.hiphopclub.biz/2009/12/ras-kass-let-the-truth-be-told/ RAS KASS: “Let the Truth be Told“] Hiphopclub.biz, 2006</ref>

===Early career===
Ras Kass took his stage name from the legendary [[Ethiopian]] Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] whose name was Ras Kassa Mircha before he was crowned as an emperor. In 1991, he made his debut appearance on the single "Trick or Treat" by Wild West Corral alongside B.O.X., Ganjah K, Torche and produced by [[Battlecat (record producer)|DJ Battlecat]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.discogs.com/release/8637658-Wild-West-Corral-Featuring-BOX-Ras-Kass-The-Chronic-3-Torche-Trick-Or-Treat  |title = Wild West Corral – Trick Or Treat |website=Discogs.com}}</ref> Ras Kass sent waves through the hip-hop world with his debut independent single release "Remain Anonymous," earning him a Hip-Hop Quotable in ''The Source Magazine''. Before his signing with Priority/EMI Records, Ras Kass began making guest appearances on several records and freestyles on numerous radio shows, further solidified the emerging lyricist's notoriety. Recorded guest appearances include Sway & King Tech's "Come Widdit" (feat. Ras Kass, Ahamad and Saafir) ([[Priority Records]]) and their "Wake Up Show Anthem '94" (feat. Ras Kass, [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Chino XL]], [[Organized Konfusion]] and [[Saafir]]), as well as Chino XL's "Riiiot" ([[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]]), and [[KeyKool]] and [[Rhettmatic]]'s "E=MC5" (feat. Ras Kass, LMNO, and Meen Green) [[Up Above Records]].

===''Soul on Ice'' and ''Rasassination''===
From a young age, Austin was influenced by hip hop music and inspired by a variety of emcees including [[Ice Cube]], [[Rakim]], [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]], and [[KRS-One]]. His first album, ''[[Soul on Ice (album)|Soul on Ice]]'', was released in 1996. Taking its name from a book by [[Eldridge Cleaver]], Ras addressed racial relations in the same manner, most notably with "Ordo Abchao" and "Nature of the Threat." The album was released on [[Priority Records]], as was the follow-up, ''[[Rasassination]]'', which featured beats from [[Easy Mo Bee]] and guest appearances by [[RZA]], [[Twista]], [[Xzibit]], [[Mack 10]] and [[Dr. Dre]]. Lead single "Ghetto Fabulous" featured Dre and Mack 10 and was pushed by a lavish video shoot. The album received generally positive reviews,<ref>{{cite web|author=Nathan Rabin |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rasassination-mw0000033837 |title=Rasassination – Ras Kass &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=September 2, 1998|access-date=July 18, 2015}}</ref> and shortly afterward the MC announced his third album, ''Van Gogh''.

===Priority issues, ''Van Gogh'' and ''Goldyn Chyld''===
During the recording of Ras's intended third album, ''Van Gogh'', Priority Records merged with [[Capitol Records]], which acquired the emcee's contract and his material.<ref name="craveonline.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/articles/music/04648886/ras_kass_and_capitol_records_finally_part_ways.html |title=Ras Kass and Capitol Records finally part ways. |work=CraveOnline |access-date=March 9, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207032258/http://www.craveonline.com/articles/music/04648886/ras_kass_and_capitol_records_finally_part_ways.html |archive-date=February 7, 2008 }}</ref> Initially near completion, the album was heavily bootlegged before any single or promotion could be prepared. In fact, the would-be single "Van Gogh" was even played on an episode of [[Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood|The Sopranos]]. Ras went back to work overhauling the project, procuring tracks from [[DJ Premier]], [[Hi-Tek]], and Dr. Dre and retaining songs from [[Rockwilder]] and [[Battlecat (record producer)|Battlecat]]. Tensions arose during the re-recording, from budget restrictions to lack of promotion: Despite the fact that "Van Gogh" remained shelved the album's singles "Back It Up" and "Goldyn Chyld" received a decent number of spins on Los Angeles urban contemporary radio stations KKBT (The Beat) and KPWR (Power 106) during the course of 2001–02.

{{cquote|I would always tell Priority executives, "You give me a road kill cow and pair of scissors but you expect a pair of Air Jordans. It's not fair." Ironically, I would still somehow manage to make a couple pairs.|30px|30px|Ras Kass}}

Ras Kass was also involved in [[The HRSMN]], sometimes called the 4 Hrsmn, consisting of himself, [[Kurupt]] (of Tha Dogg Pound), [[Killah Priest]], and [[Canibus]]. ''[[The Horsemen Project]]'', a white-label of rough tracks by the four, was released in 2003, but no other releases have been subsequently forthcoming. Finally, nearing the completion of his album, the MC and Priority disagreed over the lead single. Originally pushing "Goldyn Chyld," produced by DJ Premier, Priority executives decided to try to release the Dr. Dre-produced "The Whoop" instead, against the wishes of both Ras Kass and Dr. Dre. As he was finishing up ''Goldyn Chyld'', Kass was pulled over in California and arrested for a [[D.U.I.]], marking his third; though sentenced to jail time, he was given an extension. Two weeks before the start of his sentence, Priority informed him of their decision not to put out ''Goldyn Chyld'' after all. Becoming a fugitive, Ras attained the masters to his project, recorded some music, and finally turned himself in to police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphop-elements.com/article/read/6/5905/1/|title=Ras Kass |website=HipHop-Elements.com|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> During this time, he also had minor problems with producer [[The Alchemist (producer)|the Alchemist]], who sold Ras a beat that he later re-sold to rapper [[Jadakiss]], which ultimately formed the basis for the track "[[We Gonna Make It]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/ras_kass/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008172041/http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/ras_kass/index.html |archive-date=October 8, 2003 |title=ukhh.com &#124; features &#124; interviews &#124; Ras Kass Interview by Kobi |access-date=March 10, 2020}}</ref>

===Incarceration, ''Institutionalized I and II'', Priority release===
After serving only 19 months for his D.U.I. charge, Ras Kass recorded the album ''Institutionalized'' and began seeking release from his contract with Priority/Capitol Records. Though intended to be an album, it was released as a [[mixtape]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=raskass|title=Exclusive Hip Hop News, Audio, Lyrics, Videos, Honeys, Wear, Sneakers, Download Mixtapes|website=Hiphopgame.com|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> generating a moderate buzz<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/101005/ |title=Mixtape Monday: Mixtape Monday: Ras Kass Claims L.A.

During this time, he put out the album ''[[Institutionalized Vol. 2|Institutionalized Volume 2]]'' on [[Babygrande Records]]. After nearly two years of incarceration, Ras Kass was released from jail at the end of May 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ismael AbduSalaam and Remmie Fresh |url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2009/04/27/21474450.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430101357/http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2009/04/27/21474450.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 30, 2009 |title=AllHipHop.com Daily News – : Ras Kass Secures May Release Date From Prison |access-date=March 10, 2020}}</ref>

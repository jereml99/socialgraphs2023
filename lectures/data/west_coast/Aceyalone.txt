==Career==
===Project Blowed and Freestyle Fellowship===
Aceyalone emerged from the [[Project Blowed]] collective, considered to be the longest-running open mic hip-hop workshop.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thill|first=Scott|title=Freestyle Fellowship’s Brain-Hop Delivers on Promise|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/10/freestyle-fellowship/|publisher=Wired|access-date=24 January 2014}}</ref> He began rapping as part of the group [[Freestyle Fellowship]], which consisted of Aceyalone, [[Myka 9]], and Self Jupiter. Later, P.E.A.C.E. Freestyle Fellowship developed a reputation for influencing a style of fast double-time rap used by rappers like [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], and [[Migos]].<ref name="Weiss">{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Jeff|title=Having Already Influenced Every Rapper You Like, Freestyle Fellowship Are Back|url=http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2011/09/27/having-already-influenced-every-rapper-you-like-freestyle-fellowship-are-back|work=LA Weekly|access-date=24 January 2014}}</ref>

Aceyalone was part of Freestyle Fellowship releases of ''[[To Whom It May Concern...]]'' and ''[[Innercity Griots]]'' and a [[Project Blowed]] compilation in 1994. 

===Solo projects===
Aceyalone signed as a solo artist to [[Capitol Records]] after the Freestyle Fellowship failed to break into mainstream radio with [[Island Records]].<ref name="Weiss"/>

Aceyalone released his debut solo album, ''[[All Balls Don't Bounce]]'', in 1995.<ref name="hiphopdx">{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1673/title.aceyalone-bounce-these-balls|title=Aceyalone: Bounce These Balls|publisher=HipHopDX|first=Paul W|last=Arnold|date=March 20, 2011|access-date=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212105848/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1673/title.aceyalone-bounce-these-balls|archive-date=February 12, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> He returned three years later with the dark concept album ''[[A Book of Human Language]]'', which was a collaboration with producer Mumbles.<ref name="Pecoraro">{{cite web|last=Pecoraro|first=David|title=Aceyalone - Accepted Eclectic|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17-accepted-eclectic/|work=Pitchfork|access-date=24 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/43612/Aceyalone-Book-of-Human-Language/|title=Aceyalone - Book of Human Language|publisher=Sputnikmusic|date=May 25, 2011}}</ref> His third solo album, ''[[Accepted Eclectic]]'', was released in 2001 and featured [[Abstract Rude]] with production from [[Evidence (musician)|Evidence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynexus.com/2001-03-01/aceyalone-accepted-eclectic-project-blowed/|title=Aceyalone - Accepted Eclectic - Project Blowed|publisher=The Daily Nexus|first=Trey|last=Clark|date=March 1, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/HipHop/aceyalone-accepted_eclectic|title=Aceyalone - Accepted Eclectic|publisher=Exclaim!|first=Del F.|last=Cowie|date=April 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/accepted-eclectic-mw0000000538/credits|title=Accepted Eclectic |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=24 January 2014}}</ref> He released ''[[Hip Hop and the World We Live In]]'' in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16-hip-hop-and-the-world-we-live-in/|title=Aceyalone: Hip Hop and the World We Live In|publisher=Pitchfork Media|first=Julianne|last=Shepherd|date=March 2, 2003}}</ref> Aceyalone's next offering came a year later, and was titled ''[[Love & Hate (Aceyalone album)|Love & Hate]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2003-07-10/music/aceyalone/|title=Aceyalone|publisher=Phoenix New Times|first=Tamara|last=Palmer|date=July 10, 2003|access-date=2012-08-20|archive-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211054139/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2003-07-10/music/aceyalone/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/HipHop/aceyalone-love_hate|title=Aceyalone - Love & Hate|publisher=Exclaim!|first=Thomas|last=Quinlan|date=July 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/HipHop/aceyalone-love_hate-2|title=Aceyalone - Love & Hate|publisher=Exclaim!|first=Del F.|last=Cowie|date=July 2003}}</ref> The track “Find Out” was featured on the soundtrack to ''[[You Got Served]]''.<ref name="Johnson">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Nicole|title=Lightning Strikes by Aceyalone|url=http://www.imposemagazine.com/reviews/lightning-strikes--aceyalone|work=Impose|access-date=24 January 2014}}</ref> In 2006, Aceyalone released ''[[Magnificent City]]'', a collaborative album with producer [[RJD2]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/aceyalone-with-rjd2/magnificent-city/14882/|title=Aceyalone with RJD - Magnificent City|publisher=Prefix|first=Eric|last=Solomon|date=February 14, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/HipHop/aceyalone-magnificent_city|title=Aceyalone - Magnificent City|publisher=Exclaim!|first=Nick|last=Patch|date=April 2006}}</ref> followed by the ''[[Grand Imperial (album)|Grand Imperial]]'' mixtape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/grand-imperial-mw0000525058|title=Grand Imperial - Aceyalone|publisher=Allmusic|first=Marisa|last=Brown}}</ref>

Aceyalone frequently collaborates with producer Bionik, including on the 2007 release ''[[Lightning Strikes (Aceyalone album)|Lightning Strikes]]'' and the 2009 release ''[[Aceyalone & the Lonely Ones]]''. Both albums explored different genres – [[dancehall]] and [[doo-wop]], respectively – as part of Aceyalone's goal of “exploring the world of music through hip hop.”<ref name="Johnson" /> The [[Phil Spector]]-inspired ''Aceyalone & the Lonely Ones'' followed.<ref name="ign" /> Inspired by Spector's [[Wall of Sound]], [[Motown]] and [[Bo Diddley]], Aceyalone said: “I'm not from that era, but this is my ode to it. I'm just putting myself into that character as a showman and bandleader.”<ref name="ign">{{cite web|title=Aceyalone Goes Doo Wopping|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/03/aceyalone-goes-doo-woppin|work=IGN|access-date=24 January 2014}}</ref> ''[[Leanin' on Slick]]'', released in 2013 with [[Decon Records]], continued the retro flow of the previous release, this time taking inspiration from [[1960s R&B|1960s style-R&B]] and hot buttered soul.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leanin' On Slick|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/leanin-on-slick-mw0002485023|work=AllMusic|access-date=24 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/HipHop/aceyalone-leanin_on_slick|title=Aceyalone - Leanin' On Slick|publisher=Exclaim!|first=Thomas|last=Quinlan|date=May 27, 2013}}</ref>

==Style and influences==
Aceyalone has been noted particularly for his innovative lyrical style and content. Some attribute the double-time rap styles that emerged in the mid-1990s to Aceyalone and [[Freestyle Fellowship]], although this is disputed by others.<ref>{{cite web|last=Drake|first=David|title=Hip-Hop's Sonic Doppelgangers|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/04/hip-hops-sonic-doppelgangers-20-rappers-who-sound-like-other-rappers/bone-thugs-and-freestyle-fellowship|work=Complex|access-date=24 January 2014}}</ref>

Aceyalone and Freestyle Fellowship were noted for their rejection of the West Coast trend of gangsta rap. Aceyalone developed strong critiques of rap music's commercialization and glorification of violence.<ref name="Pecoraro"/>

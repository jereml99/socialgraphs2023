== Early life ==
Avante Ramone Brown was born on March 24, 1998, in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. His mother is a [[spoken word]] artist, and he "might share some relatives" with rapper [[Baby Keem]].<ref name=":0"/> Brown moved around a lot growing up and experienced many different environments, which he believes has made him very adaptive and socially well-rounded.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=McKinney |first=Jessica |date=April 28, 2022 |title=Meet Tanna Leone, the New Signee on Kendrick Lamar's pgLang |url=https://www.complex.com/music/tanna-leonne-interview-sleepy-soldier/interview-4 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220503184921/https://www.complex.com/music/tanna-leonne-interview-sleepy-soldier/ |archive-date=May 3, 2022 |access-date=May 11, 2022 |website=[[Complex Networks|Complex]]}}</ref>

Following in his mother's footsteps, Brown made his first song at age 11. He would continue to write songs for fun, and often performed them for friends at school. He would later join a poetry club that held cyphers, where he was able to refine his lyrical skills. His first performance in front of a crowd surprisingly felt "extremely natural," which opened him up to the idea of pursuing a professional career as an artist.<ref name=":0" />

== Career ==
After finishing school, Brown relocated to [[Atlanta]], where he became serious about pursuing a rap career. He adopted the [[stage name]] Noviiimber and began releasing music through 680079 Records, as a member of the hip hop [[Musical collective|collective]] Safe House Music Group.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-05-27 |title=Noviiimber - Awesome (Official Video) |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=kwZ55AnWdCk |access-date=2023-06-27 |website=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-07-28 |title=Noviiimber - " Saint Like " (Official Music Video) [SHOT + EDITED BY MALIPUTYOUON] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fk_scm5dve |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=YouTube}}</ref> His first project, an [[extended play]] titled ''Do or Die'', was released on March 29, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Do or Die - Stream TANNA LEONE |url=https://soundcloud.com/tannaleone/sets/do-or-die |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=SoundCloud |language=en}}</ref> Later in the year, he changed his stage name to Baby Santana and joined the group Dog Eat World, alongside local rappers Nino Shyne and Lone London.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Santana |first=Baby |date=2021-01-21 |title=Gunz & Rosez ft Lone London (visualizer) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksfccyqqmek |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=YouTube}}</ref>

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Brown moved back to Los Angeles and changed his stage name a third time to Tanna Leone. He then contacted filmmaker [[Dave Free]] to show him ''Die or Die'' and a video he directed.<ref name=":0" /> It sparked a conversation between the two and secured Leone a [[Joint venture|joint]] [[recording contract]] with [[PGLang]], which Free founded with rapper [[Kendrick Lamar]], and [[Def Jam Recordings]] on March 9, 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Aswad |first=Jem |date=2022-03-10 |title=Music Industry Moves: Recording Academy Names Ryan Butler VP of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion; Def Jam Teams With Kendrick Lamar, Dave Free to Sign Tanna Leone |url=https://variety.com/2022/music/news/recording-academy-ryan-butler-diversity-dei-def-jam-kendrick-lamar-dave-freetanna-leone-1235201423/ |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Walker |first=Joe |date=2022-03-10 |title=Kendrick Lamar’s pgLang Signs L.A.

== Artistry ==
Leone has described his sound as having the strength of a [[Hip hop music|rap]] song, and the melodies of a [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] or [[Rock music|rock]] song. He explained that his music strays from "following any type of rule book or guideline. It's just something you could feel."<ref name=":0" /> Leone lists [[Tupac Shakur]], [[DMX]], [[New Edition]], and Lamar as some of his main influences, while also naming [[Frank Ocean]], [[André 3000]], [[Missy Elliott]], and [[Billie Eilish]] as some of his favorite artists.<ref name=":0"/>

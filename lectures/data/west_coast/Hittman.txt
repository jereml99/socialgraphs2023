'''Brian Anthony Bailey''' (born September 14, 1974), best known under his stage name '''Hittman''' (acronym for '''''H'''ighly '''I'''ntense '''T'''ongue '''T'''alents '''M'''ake '''A'''ll '''N'''ervous''), is an American West Coast rapper, songwriter and record producer originating from Los Angeles.

==Career==
Hittman was signed into [[Dr. Dre]]'s [[Aftermath Entertainment]] label in 1998. He received various guest appearances, rapping on 9 tracks off Dr. Dre's ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'' album, making him the most featured artist. Under Dr. Dre's label, he failed to release his own album, and soon faded into obscurity and left the label.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://allhiphop.com/2014/11/13/dr-dre-protege-hittman-aftermath-didnt-succeed/ |publisher= AllHipHop.com | title= Dr. Dre's Former Protégé Hittman Gives His Opinion On Why Artists Didn't Succeed On Aftermath| date=  November 13, 2014| access-date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/hittman/ | publisher= DubCNN.com (West Coast News Network)| title= Interviews: Hittman|  interviewer= Lil Jay| date= July 2006| access-date= }}</ref>

In 2000, he released his most popular single, "Last Dayz", featured on the [[B-side]] of the Dr. Dre single, "[[Forgot About Dre]]". In the music video for "Forgot About Dre", "Last Dayz" got its own one-minute segment at the end.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFcv5Ma8u8k| title= Forgot About Dre Music Video | via= YouTube | date= | access-date= | publisher= }}</ref> After leaving Aftermath, he released his own solo album in 2005, ''Hittmanic Verses'' under Sick Bay Records.

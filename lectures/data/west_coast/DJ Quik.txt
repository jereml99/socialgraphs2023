Blake has collaborated with [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Kurupt]], [[Tupac]], [[Chingy]], [[R. Kelly]] and [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[DJ Quik production discography|among others]]. Blake's stage name reflects his ability to produce songs in a short period of time.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpsiM9cxCJA Weakest Link With Rappers Part 2]. YouTube (January 27, 2007).

== Early life ==
Blake was born on January 18, 1970, in [[Compton, California]]. He was inspired by funk and soul artists,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/quik-is-the-name-mw0000272541|title=Quik Is the Name – DJ Quik – Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref> such as [[Roger Troutman]] (who taught him the use of the [[talkbox]], which became a trademark for Quik's sound throughout his career) and [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]].

Blake began selling homemade [[mixtape]]s (notably ''The Red Tape'', 1987) after he received a [[phonograph|turntable]] for his 8th grade promotion. He began doing shows DJing around [[Southern California]], many of which ended in rival gang-related altercations. He joined the [[Tree Top Piru|Tree Top Piru Bloods]], which he later regretted, stating that joining the gang "was the dumbest shit."<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2009-06-06 |title=DJ Quik Speaks On Gang Life |url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.9260/title.dj-quik-speaks-on-gang-life |access-date=2023-04-01 |website=HipHopDX |language=en}}</ref>

At age 16 in 1986, Quik dropped out of high school. For three years he was homeless because his mother lost her home due to foreclosure. He would later go on to say that after his success in the rap world, many of his family members "popped up".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2011-06-02/music/dj-quik-trials-and-tribulations-of-a-west-coast-legend/|title=DJ Quik: Trials and Tribulations of a West Coast Legend|work=LA Weekly|access-date=June 11, 2011|date=June 2, 2011}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== Quik is the Name ===
After gaining a mixtape following, Blake earned the interest of labels, including [[Profile Records]] and [[Ruthless Records]]. He signed to [[Profile Records]] in the summer of 1990, reportedly as the label's first six-figure signee.<ref>[http://hhgl2.ggl.com/index.php?controller=FeaturedPlayer&id=23 Hip Hop Gaming League 2<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513114003/http://hhgl2.ggl.com/index.php?controller=FeaturedPlayer&id=23 |date=May 13, 2007 }}</ref> Blake later regretted his contract, and was offered an advance of one million dollars by [[Eazy-E]].<ref>[http://vimeo.com/24593445 DJ Quik : Compton Alumni on Vimeo]. Vimeo.com. Retrieved on March 11, 2012.</ref> Profile Records sent cease-and-desist letters to Ruthless Records.

His debut album, ''[[Quik Is the Name]]'', was released in 1991. The album was led by the success of his two top 20 R&B singles, "Tonite" and "Born and Raised in Compton." The album ended up being number 10 on the album charts,<ref name="billboard.com">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/dj-quik|title=DJ Quik Chart History|magazine=Billboard|access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref> and was Platinum by the RIAA.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228071417/http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp|date=February 28, 2007}}</ref> None of his successive albums reached the success of his debut, though they have been well received. He went on to produce ''[[2nd II None (album)|2nd II None]]''.

=== Way 2 Fonky ===
He released his second album, titled ''[[Way 2 Fonky]]'' in 1992. It was certified Gold by October 9. It included the successful singles "Way 2 Fonky" and "Jus Lyke Compton." The year 1992 would also see him produce (along with [[Eazy-E]]) on ''[[Paid the Cost]]'', the debut album by rap duo [[Penthouse Players Clique]].

=== ''Safe + Sound'' ===
Before recording ''Safe + Sound'', DJ Quik had previously scrapped an album, which he said was so horrible that he had to smash the masters.<ref>''The Source Magazine'' April 1995 Page 61</ref>

As DJ Quik began to work on his third album, he started working with [[Suge Knight]] again. Their relationship dates back to 1988, before he sought refuge with a major label. He was signed to Suge's independent label Funky Enough Records in 1988.<ref>''The Source Magazine'' April 1995 Page 58</ref><ref>''The Source Magazine'' April 1995 Page 60</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XCphjkEVXHs/TCMU4Wv4kEI/AAAAAAAABq8/ghyF3Pell7I/s1600/DJ+Quik.jpeg |title=Brand New Fonk |publisher=3.bp.blogspot.com |access-date=July 25, 2013}}</ref> The arrangement proved to be short lived. They linked up again in 1993 for another short lived arrangement.

His third album ''[[Safe + Sound]]'', released in 1995, made number 14 on the Billboard 200. It featured friends 2nd II None, [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]], Playa Hamm and [[Hi-C (rapper)|Hi-C]]. The album features the singles "Dollaz & Sense" and "Safe + Sound". During the process of the album, Quik was feuding with rapper [[MC Eiht]] from Compton's Most Wanted and long time friend AMG. Today, he is on good terms with MC Eiht.
''Safe + Sound'' saw Suge being the executive producer. His relationship with Suge led him to produce some of the tracks on ''[[Above The Rim]]'', ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'', ''[[All Eyez On Me]]'', ''[[Until the End of Time (Tupac Shakur album)|Until the End of Time]]'', ''[[Better Dayz]]'' and [[It's About Time (Danny Boy album)|''It's About Time'']] and was on [[Death Row Records]] for a short period but never released an album while on the label. He also produced a 2nd II None album for Death Row Records, which was never released.

Quik played a part on the [[Tupac]] album ''All Eyez On Me'', though he is only credited for producing "Heartz of Men" on that album (in the credits he used his real name, David Blake, because he was under contract to Profile). He also did additional production and mixed half the album in over two days.<ref name="hiphopdx1" /> Quik made another uncredited appearance on a song with Tupac named "Thug Passion". He also produced on the albums ''[[Dogg Food]]'' and ''[[Tha Doggfather]]'', although he received no credit. DJ Quik later went to say that he had some of the best times of his life when he worked with the label.

=== Rhythm-al-ism and beyond ===
In 1996, Quik produced a track on ''[[House of Music]]'', by [[Tony! Toni! Toné!]]. The success of the Quik-produced single "Let's Get Down" prompted ''House of Music'' to sell over 1 million copies. He also worked with [[Shaquille O'Neal]] on his ''[[You Can't Stop the Reign]]'' album. DJ Quik later discovered [[Suga Free]], a pimp turned rapper in 1997.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Their relationship saw Quik serving as the producer on his debut album, ''Street Gospel''. It reached number 27 on the Billboard R&B albums chart.<ref name="Stanley">Stanley, Leo "[http://www.allmusic.com/album/street-gospel-r276567/review ''Street Gospel'' Review]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved January 29, 2011</ref><ref name="Birchmeier">Birchmeier, Jason "[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/suga-free-p167914/biography Suga Free Biography]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved January 29, 2011</ref><ref name="Charts">"[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/suga-free-p167914/charts-awards Suga Free Charts & Awards]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved January 29, 2011</ref> The album fell short of commercial expectations, but was praised by many underground rap fans in California, and is seen as a "street classic" by many of them. The DJ Quik production on this album was considered to be refreshing compared to the stereotypical West Coast G-Funk sound that had dominated most of the early 1990s, as he incorporated elements of jazz, funk, rhythm and blues, and even rock and roll to create instrumentals that caught the ears of many listeners. It was recorded in a record of 28 days.

In 1998 Quik released ''[[Rhythm-al-ism]]'' his fourth studio album on [[Profile Records]]. This record was certified Gold in 1999, and contained the singles "Hand in Hand (featuring 2nd II None and El Debarge) and "You'z A Ganxta." It featured guest appearances by [[Nate Dogg]], [[Snoop Dogg]], AMG and Suga Free. That year he went on to produce for The [[Luniz]], Shaquille O'Neal, [[Deborah Cox]] and [[Jermaine Dupri]]. He also produced on ''[[The Kingdom Come]]'' by rapper [[King Tee]] which ultimately never came out due to label problems. He also faced personal and professional tragedy when his nephew murdered his close friend and protégé Darryl Cortez Reed in 1998. In 1999, there was the release of ''[[Classic 220]]'' by 2nd II None, in which Quik played a huge part. Production on [[Gap Band]]'s ''Y2K: Funkin' Till 2000 Comz'' album, [[Snoop Dogg]]'s ''[[No Limit Top Dogg]]'', ''[[Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000]]'' and ''[[Deep Blue Sea (soundtrack)]]''. This was compounded by the death of another friend and rapper Mausberg, subsequently murdered in 2000. That year, saw the release of rapper Mausberg's album, and DJ Quik's ''[[Balance & Options]]''. Also production with [[Whitney Houston]], [[Erick Sermon]], [[8Ball & MJG]], [[Xzibit]] and [[AMG (rapper)|AMG]].

After the lackluster sales of only 400,000 units of his fifth album, he was dropped by [[Arista Records]], which had bought Profile Records. He produced for [[Kurupt]], [[Big Syke]], [[Janet Jackson]], and Won G. He produced on ''Made (soundtrack)'' in 2001. That year also saw Suge Knight try to get Quik as the in-house producer for [[Death Row Records]]. In 2002, he released ''[[Under tha Influence]]'' under [[Ark 21 Records]] which sold only 200,000 units.  He also produced [[Truth Hurts (singer)|Truth Hurts]]' only Top 10 pop hit "[[Addictive (song)|Addictive]]" that year. However, he had sampled a [[Hindi]] song by the name "Thoda Resham Lagta Hai" originally sung by the legendary Hindi singing prodigy [[Lata Mangeshkar]] on the record, and the copyright holders [[Saregama]] Music eventually filed a $500 million [[lawsuit]] against Truth Hurts' label, [[Aftermath Entertainment]], that was amicably resolved by [[Jimmy Iovine]] and [[Dr. Dre]]. The song instrumental was sample in the Jamaican dancehall beat "[[Greensleeves Rhythm Album 30: Bollywood|'''Bollywood Riddim''']]".  DJ Quik also produced and appeared on another track on Truth Hurts' debut LP, ''[[Truthfully Speaking]]'', titled "I'm Not Really Lookin".<ref>[http://www.dubcnn.com/thevault/index.html#t // West Coast News Network //]. Dubcnn.com. Retrieved on March 11, 2012.</ref> He worked with [[Talib Kweli]], [[Will Smith]], and [[Shade Sheist]] that year.

Record problems and a plethora of others almost prompted Quik to retire. The album ''[[The Best of DJ Quik: Da Finale]]'' was originally going to be his last release. He later stated:
{{Blockquote|I just couldn't escape that contract. Basic contracts are supposed to be like 6 or 7 years, or 1 year with like maybe 6 options. The contract I was in was like a 10 or 11 year contract. I wasn't getting paid and I wasn't happy at all. And plus I was going through a bunch of shit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.westcoast2k.net/interviews/djquik.html|title=This site is temporarily unavailable|date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070811/http://www.westcoast2k.net/interviews/djquik.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>}}
He later decided to come back. In 2003 [[Jay-Z]] commissioned Quik to produce on ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]''. Rapper Chingy worked with Quik on his [[Jackpot (Chingy album)|Jackpot]] which also proved to be a hit. He worked for [[Roscoe (rapper)|Roscoe]], [[Butch Cassidy]], [[Nate Dogg]], [[E-40]], [[TQ (singer)|TQ]] and Hi-C. In 2003 he also saw [[50 Cent]] become a bigger star, as the aforementioned [[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich Or Die Tryin]] album featured [[In Da Club]] which Quik did the drums for.

[[Ludacris]] got DJ Quik to produce on ''[[The Red Light District]]'' in 2004. He was also commissioned for a remix on the 2Pac album ''[[Loyal to the Game]]''. He also worked with [[Knoc-turn'al]] and [[Suga Free]] that year.

=== Mad Science Recordings ===
In September 2005, DJ Quik released his first independent album on his own new label, Mad Science Recordings. The album is titled ''[[Trauma (DJ Quik album)|Trauma]]'' and reflects the turmoil in the producer's "musical" life over the past few years. It was considered an independent success and has sold over 100,000 copies.<ref>[http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/wc2kdjquik05/ // West Coast News Network //]. Dubcnn.com. Retrieved on March 11, 2012.</ref> In recent years he has worked with a 74-piece orchestra while working on the score to the movie "[[Head of State (2003 film)|Head of State]]" with Marcus Miller.

On June 21, 2006, DJ Quik was convicted of [[assault]] on his sister and sentenced to five months in prison.<ref name="assault">{{cite news |first=Rod |last=Leveque |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-14462707.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105004040/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-14462707.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 5, 2012 |title=Rapper DJ Quik begins five-month jail sentence for assaulting sister  |newspaper=Inland Valley Daily Bulletin |date=June 27, 2006 |format=Fee required |access-date=May 13, 2010 }}</ref> The incident occurred in 2003, when he allegedly "pistol-whipped" her for extorting him, according to police reports. He was released early in October 2006. He went on to say that prison sentence gave him time to reflect on his life, and he later began getting rid of extra baggage.

In late 2007, DJ Quik and [[AMG (rapper)|AMG]] formed the group [[the Fixxers]]. Along with the formation of the duo, he dropped the "DJ" from his name for the upcoming album and rapped as "Quik".<ref>[http://www.dubcnn.com/arc1-2007.html // West Coast News Network //].

== Feud with Compton's Most Wanted ==
{{BLP one source|section|date=January 2023}}
DJ Quik got involved in a long tumultuous rivalry with fellow Compton rapper [[MC Eiht]] and his group [[Compton's Most Wanted]] that lasted for six years. The feud traces back to a track on DJ Quik's debut mixtape ''The Red Tape'', in a line by Quik that was seen as indirectly disparaging [[N.W.A]] and directly disparaging Compton's Most Wanted.

{{Blockquote
| text = To the Top of the Tree/
For CMW to see}}

During that time, Quik was a member to the [[Pirus|Tree Top Pirus]] and Eiht was a member of the 159th St. [[Crips|Tragniew Park Compton Crips]]. On the track "Def Wish" from CMW's second album ''[[Straight Checkn 'Em]]'', is the line, "Bittin' me quick, you can get the duck sick quick...". Fans of both artists assumed that to be a disparagement of Quik. With the misconstrued feud gaining momentum, Quik respond to CMW's diss in his song "[[Way 2 Fonky]]". CMW responded months later with a music video for Def Wish II that featured a DJ Quik lookalike having a surreal nightmare of CMW chasing & ambushing him leading to him getting killed. Quik responded to it with "Let You Havit", mentioning the Compton's Most Wanted music video, while facing label problems and had other music projects. Eiht had then responded with Def Wish III, leading to the high point of the rivalry. However, on the soundtrack to the 1994 short film ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'', on the track "Dollaz + Sense", Quik ruthlessly verbally attacks Eiht, calling him a movie script killer (in reference to Eiht's appearance in the critically acclaimed 1993 film [[Menace II Society]]), a coward, and more. Quik fanned the flames by performing the song at the 1995 [[Source Awards]] in [[New York City]]. The feud stayed quiet until April 1996, when Eiht responded to Quik on his second solo album ''[[Death Threatz]]'' which featured Def Wish IV (Tap That Azz) which was the last diss track of their feud. The feud between Quik and Eiht slowly faded in 1997 following the deaths of Tupac and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], but did not actually end until 1998, where [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Daz Dillinger]], and other West Coast rappers helped Eiht and Quik reconcile. Since then, Quik and Eiht have collaborated on various songs. It has been considered by hip hop fans and critics as standing out as one of the longest active hip hop rivalries – from 1992 to 1998.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.37028/title.mc-eiht-reveals-origins-of-feud-with-dj-quik# |title = MC Eiht Reveals Origins of Feud with DJ Quik|date = January 14, 2016}}</ref>

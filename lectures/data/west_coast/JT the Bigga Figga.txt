== Music career ==
In 1991, JT founded the independent record label [[Get Low Recordz]].<ref name=sfweekly1995/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/get-low-recordz-9202a8c04000641f8000000000e07ea8#|title="Get Low Recordz" Artist's Music Videos|work=OVGuide|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref> What started as a basement enterprise and a one-man operation, would later become one of the most successful independent labels in the country.<ref name=sfweekly2004>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2004-08-11/music/wall-street-playaz/|title=Wall Street Playaz|work=SF Weekly|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref>

JT's rap debut came in 1992 with the self-released album ''[[Don't Stop til We Major]]'' at the age of 18. The next year he followed it up with ''[[Playaz N the Game]]''.<ref name=sfweekly2004/> The album's first single, "Game Recognize Game" received significant airplay, thrusting JT into the spotlight. The success of his album led to a bidding war among record labels, and he eventually signed with [[Priority Records]] in 1995.<ref name=sfweekly1995/><ref name=sfweekly2004/><ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p51|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: JT the Bigga Figga|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|publisher=[[All Media Guide|AMG]]|access-date=16 May 2010}}</ref> Subsequent albums released through Priority Records were unsuccessful, however, and in 1996 the label elected to release JT from his contract. JT The Bigga Figga appeared on [[No Limit Records]]'s May 1997 release, ''[[I'm Bout It (soundtrack)|I'm Bout It]]'', appearing on the song "Game Tight" with The Fast One. Both JT The Bigga Figga & The Fast One produced the song.

After the dissolution of his contract with Priority Records, JT went back to self-distributing his albums through Get Low Recordz. With the money from his deal with Priority, JT invested in a new state of the art [[recording studio]] and began rapidly producing and releasing numerous albums. In 2000, after signing a modest distribution deal with Bayside Records, Get Low began expanding, releasing nearly 20 albums a year.<ref name=sfweekly2004/>

In 2002, JT published an E-Book called ''The CEO Manual.''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/jtbiggafigga/ | title=JT the Bigga Figga | publisher=Dubcnn | access-date=19 October 2019}}</ref>

JT is credited with discovering rapper [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], and releasing his first two albums ''Untold Story'' and ''QB 2 Compton'' before The Game signed with [[Dr. Dre]] and debuted as a member of the [[Aftermath Entertainment]] camp.<ref>{{cite web |author=jonahm |title=JT The Bigga Figga on discovering The Game, founding Trapflix & making movies to push music (Part 2) (Exclusive Interview) |url=https://www.thizzler.com/blog/2019/04/25/jt-the-bigga-figga-on-discovering-the-game-founding-trapflix-making-movies-to-push-music-part-2-exclusive-interview.html |website=Thizzler on the Roof |publisher=thizzler.com |access-date=9 February 2020|date=26 April 2019 }}</ref>

In fall of 2005, JT was named [[A&R]] for the West Coast operations of the [[Houston]], Texas-based [[Rap-A-Lot Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slumz.boxden.com/f87/jt-bigga-figga-named-president-rap-lot-west-great-news-454803/|title=JT The Bigga Figga Named President of Rap-A-Lot West, GREAT NEWS|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref>

In 2006, JT worked with [[Snoop Dogg]] on a documentary DVD entitled ''Mandatory Business'', which featured such names as [[Russell Simmons]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Xzibit]], [[Young Buck]] and [[50 Cent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webmedia.newsvine.com/_news/2006/09/06/353289-snoop-dogs-new-indie-movie-mandatory-business|title=Snoop Dog's New Indie Movie "Mandatory Business"|author=The Web Developer|date=20 March 2015|work=Newsvine|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref>
